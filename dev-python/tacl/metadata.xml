	<longdescription>TACL====tacl is a tool for performing basic text analysis on the textsavailable from the `Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association`_(CBETA). It is largely generic, however, and can operate with minormodifications on other corpora.The code is developed at https://github.com/ajenhl/tacl/ and thedocumentation is available at http://tacl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.Installation------------Using `Python 3`_ (minimum version 3.5), either run ``pip installtacl`` or download the code manually and run ``python setup.pyinstall``. The dependencies are installed automatically when tacl isinstalled with ``pip``. Note however that on Windows (and perhaps MacOS X) it is very likely that the dependencies that have non-Pythoncomponents will not build due to a missing compiler. In such a case,follow the instructions athttps://github.com/ajenhl/tacl/wiki/InstallationUsage-----Run ``tacl -h`` for a listing of available subcommands, and ``tacl&lt;subcommand&gt; -h`` for help on a specific subcommand... _Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association: http://www.cbeta.org/.. _Python 3: http://www.python.org/.. _SQLite: http://www.sqlite.org/.. _biopython: http://biopython.org/.. _lxml: http://lxml.de/.. _pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org/</longdescription>
