It hasparticularly powerful support for multidimensional meteorologicaland oceanographic datasets, such as those used in weather, climate,and remote sensing research, but is useful for almost anythingthat you would want to plot on a map!  You can see lots of examplenotebooks at [geoviews.org](https://geoviews.org), and a goodoverview is in our [blog post announcement](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/introducing-geoviews).GeoViews is built on the [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org) library forbuilding flexible visualizations of multidimensional data.  GeoViewsadds a family of geographic plot types based on the[Cartopy](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy) library, plotted usingeither the [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) or[Bokeh](https://bokeh.org) packages.Each of the new GeoElement plot types is a new HoloViews Element thathas an associated geographic projection based on ``cartopy.crs``. TheGeoElements currently include ``Feature``, ``WMTS``, ``Tiles``,``Points``, ``Contours``, ``Image``, ``QuadMesh``, ``TriMesh``,``RGB``, ``HSV``, ``Labels``, ``Graph``, ``HexTiles``, ``VectorField``and ``Text`` objects, each of which can easily be overlaid in the sameplots. E.g. an object with temperature data can be overlaid withcoastline data using an expression like ``gv.Image(temperature) *gv.Feature(cartopy.feature.COASTLINE)``. Each GeoElement can also befreely combined in layouts with any other HoloViews Element , makingit simple to make even complex multi-figure layouts of overlaidobjects.## InstallationIf you want the latest GeoViews, you will need an up-to-date environment. Updating is never risk-free, but it is a good idea in general and the commands `conda list --revisions` and `conda install --revision N` can usually recover from updates gone awry.```conda update --all```You can then install GeoViews and all of its dependencies with the following:```conda install -c pyviz geoviews```Alternatively you can install the geoviews-core package, whichonly installs the minimal dependencies required to run geoviews:```conda install -c pyviz geoviews-core```In certain circumstances proj6 issues may prevent installation orcause issues (particularly with cartopy&lt;=0.17). If you encounter theseissues ensure you also pin proj4::    conda install proj4&lt;6Once installed you can copy the examples into the current directoryusing the ``geoviews`` command and run them using the Jupyternotebook:```geoviews examplescd geoviews-examplesjupyter notebook```(Here `geoviews examples` is a shorthand for `geoviews copy-examples--path geoviews-examples &amp;&amp; geoviews fetch-data --pathgeoviews-examples`.)In the classic Jupyter notebook environment and JupyterLab, first make sure to load the `gv.extension()`. GeoViews objects will then render themselves if they are the last item in a notebook cell. For versions of `jupyterlab&gt;=3.0` the necessary extension is automatically bundled in the `pyviz_comms` package, which must be &gt;=2.0. However note that for version of `jupyterlab&lt;3.0` you must also manually install the JupyterLab extension with:```bashjupyter labextension install @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz```Once you have installed JupyterLab and the extension launch it with:```jupyter-lab```If you want to try out the latest features between releases, you canget the latest dev release by specifying `-c pyviz/label/dev` in placeof `-c pyviz`.### Additional dependenciesIf you need to install libraries only available from conda-forge, suchas Iris (to use data stored in Iris cubes) or xesmf, you shouldinstall from conda-forge:```conda create -n env-name -c pyviz -c conda-forge geoviews iris xesmfconda activate env-name```-----GeoViews itself is also installable using `pip`, but to do that youwill first need to have installed the [dependencies of cartopy](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/installing.html#requirements),or else have set up your system to be able to build them.</longdescription>
