	<longdescription># aiobiketraxPython library for interacting with the PowUnity BikeTrax GPS tracker.[![Linting](https://github.com/basilfx/aiobiketrax/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/basilfx/aiobiketrax/actions/workflows/lint.yml)[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/aiobiketrax.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/aiobiketrax)## IntroductionThis library is mainly written to work with a custom component forHome Assistant. You can find this custom component[here](https://github.com/basilfx/homeassistant-biketrax).The [PowUnity BikeTrax](https://powunity.com/) is a GPS tracker for electricbicycles. It provides real-time updates every when the bike is in motion, usinga 2G modem. It works in Europe, and requires a subscription after a trialperiod of one year.### Features* Multi-device support.* Traccar and admin API support.* Live updates using websocket.Not implemented:* Geofencing.* Global configuration, such as webhooks.### Known issuesThe [schemas](contrib/generator/schema.json) of the models haven beenreversed-engineerd by observing responses for a small number of devices. It islikely that responses of other devices do not map onto the current models. Forexample, some properties are not set if they have never been configured fromthe app.Please open an issue, and provide some responses so that the schemas can beimproved. Be sure to redact sensitive information, such as locations, uniqueidentifiers and personal details.### DebuggingIn case of issues, it is possible to enable logging in your application for thefollowing loggers:* `aiobiketrax.api` - API logging.* `aiobiketrax.api.responses` - Additional API response logging.* `aiobiketrax.api.client` - Client interaction logging.## Usage### In code```pythonfrom aiobiketrax import Accountimport aiohttpasync with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:    account = Account(        username=&quot;someone@example.org&quot;,        password=&quot;secret&quot;,        session=session)    await account.update_devices()    for device in account.devices:        print(device.name)```### CLIFor demonstration and testing purposes, one can use the CLI as well. If youhave the package installed, use `biketrax --help` command to get started.### Mock serverFor development, a mock server is included in `contrib/mock/`. Simply run`server.py` and adapt `aiobiketrax/consts.py` to use other endpoints.```pythonAPI_TRACCAR_ENDPOINT = &quot;http://localhost:5555/traccar/api&quot;API_ADMIN_ENDPOINT = &quot;http://localhost:5555/admin/api&quot;```Do note that authentication is not mocked.## ContributingSee the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.## LicenseSee the [`LICENSE.md`](LICENSE.md) file (MIT license).## DisclaimerUse this library at your own risk.
