	<longdescription>## python-can-canineThis module is a plugin that lets you use [CANine adapters](https://tinymovr.com/products/can-bus-adapter) with the [CANine firmware](https://github.com/tinymovr/CANine) in python-can.### InstallationInstall using pip:    $ pip install python-can-canine### UsageOverall, using this plugin is quite similar to the main Python-CAN library, with the interface named `canine`. To integrate the Canine interface into your scripts, you can import constants, device designations, and more from the Python-CAN-Canine module using `import canine`. For most scenarios, incorporating a Canine interface is as easy as modifying Python-CAN examples with the lines provided below:Create python-can bus with the Canine USB interface:    import can    from canine import CANineBus    bus = can.Bus(interface=&quot;canine&quot;, bitrate=1000000)</longdescription>
