Thedownloading of sources and then configuration has to be done byhand. Usually, this is explained in a README. Instead kas is using aproject configuration file and does the download and configurationphase.Key features provided by the build tool:- clone and checkout bitbake layers- create default bitbake settings (machine, arch, ...)- launch minimal build environment, reducing risk of host contamination- initiate bitbake build processSee the `kas documentation &lt;https://kas.readthedocs.io&gt;`_ for further details.SECURITY NOTICE---------------At this stage, kas does not validate the integrity of fetched repositories.Make sure to only pull from trusted sources to ensure that the selectedrevisions are the expected ones, specifically when using mirrors. Laterversions of kas may introduce integrity validation mechanisms such ascryptographic checksums to strengthen supply chain security.</longdescription>
