No, really.There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're notready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly goodenough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code atall, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open sourceprojects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect codeisn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it'strying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from thosemistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You canhelp out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about theproject (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contributionprocess). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project asa whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can seethe errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.Note: This disclaimer was originally written by`Adrienne Lowe &lt;https://github.com/adriennefriend&gt;`_ for a`PyCon talk &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uj746j9Heo&gt;`_, and was adapted byastropy-healpix based on its use in the README file for the`MetPy project &lt;https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy&gt;`_.</longdescription>
