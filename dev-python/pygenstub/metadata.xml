	<longdescription>pygenstub=========pygenstub is a utility for generating stub files from docstringsin source files.If the docstring of a function includes a **sig** field,the value of that field will be used to generate a stubby matching the types to the parameters in the same order.For example, for the function given below:.. code-block:: python   def foo(a, b):       &quot;&quot;&quot;Do foo.       :sig: (int, str) -&gt; None       &quot;&quot;&quot;pygenstub will generate the following stub:.. code-block:: python   def foo(a: int, b: str) -&gt; None: ...pygenstub consists of a single `source file`_ which contains such signatures.You can check the `stub file`_ generated by running pygenstub on itselfas an example.Getting started---------------pygenstub runs on Python 3.6 and later versions.You can install the latest version from `PyPI`_::  pip install pygenstubInstallation creates a script named ``pygenstub`` which can be usedas follows::  pygenstub foo.pyThis command will generate the file ``foo.pyi`` in the same directoryas the input file.If the output file already exists, it will be overwritten.If you download the `source file`_, you can also run it directlywithout installing::  python pygenstub.py foo.pyIf pygenstub is activated as a Sphinx extension (after *sphinx.ext.autodoc*),it will insert type comments into the docstring:.. code-block:: python   extensions = [       &quot;sphinx.ext.autodoc&quot;,       &quot;pygenstub&quot;   ]As an example of the output, you can check the `API documentation`_for pygenstub itself.Getting help------------The documentation is available on: https://pygenstub.readthedocs.io/The source code can be obtained from: https://github.com/uyar/pygenstubLicense-------Copyright (C) 2016-2021 H.
