Youcan also use it from Bash Scripts and Windows Batch Files - See Examples.use rst_include from commandline--------------------------------.. code-block:: bash    # replace the include statements on shell or windows commandline    # path can be relative or absolute path    # examples :    # relativ path    $&gt;

package in the docutils/parsers/rst/include directory.To access these files, use the special syntax for standard &quot;include&quot; data files, angle brackets around the file name:.. code-block:: bash        .. include:: &lt;isonum.txt&gt;    # not supported nowThe current set of standard &quot;include&quot; data files consists of sets of substitution definitions. See reStructuredText Standard Definition Files for details.The following options are recognized:.. code-block:: bash    # Only the content starting from this line will be included.    # (As usual in Python, the first line has index 0 and negative values count from the end.)    # Combining start/end-line and start-after/end-before is possible.    # The text markers will be searched in the specified lines (further limiting the included content).    start-line : integer.. code-block:: bash    # Only the content up to (but excluding) this line will be included.    # Combining start/end-line and start-after/end-before is possible.    # The text markers will be searched in the specified lines (further limiting the included content).    end-line : integer.. code-block:: bash    # Only the content after the first occurrence of the specified text will be included.    # Combining start/end-line and start-after/end-before is possible.    # The text markers will be searched in the specified lines (further limiting the included content).    start-after : text to find in the external data file.. code-block:: bash    # Only the content before the first occurrence of the specified text (but after any after text) will be included.    # Combining start/end-line and start-after/end-before is possible.    # The text markers will be searched in the specified lines (further limiting the included content).    end-before : text to find in the external data file.. code-block:: bash    # The entire included text is inserted into the document as a single literal block.    literal : flag (empty).. code-block:: bash    # The argument and the content of the included file are passed to the code directive (useful for program listings).    # (New in Docutils 0.9)    code : formal language (optional).. code-block:: bash    # Precede every code line with a line number. The optional argument is the number of the first line (default 1).    # Works only with code or literal. (New in Docutils 0.9)    number-lines : [start line number].. code-block:: bash    # The text encoding of the external data file. Defaults to the document's input_encoding.    encoding : name of text encoding.. code-block:: bash    # Number of spaces for hard tab expansion. A negative value prevents expansion of hard tabs.    # Defaults to the tab_width configuration setting.    tab-width : integer.. code-block:: bash    With code or literal the common options :class: and :name: are recognized as well.    all other option in the format :&lt;option&gt;: are just passed through the codeblock-----------------------------------------------------------------Usage from Commandline------------------------.. code-block::   Usage: rst_include [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...     commandline tool to resolve RST File includes   Options:     --version                     Show the version and exit.     --traceback / --no-traceback  return traceback information on cli     -h, --help                    Show this message and exit.
