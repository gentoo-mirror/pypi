For each filetype it may use even morethan one linter or tool. Furthermore by default it only report problems of linesthat were added or modified.Current linters:- CSS  * `Csslint &lt;https://github.com/stubbornella/csslint&gt;`_- SCSS  * `scss-lint &lt;https://github.com/causes/scss-lint&gt;`_- Python  * `Pylint &lt;http://www.pylint.org/&gt;`_  * `pycodestyle &lt;https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle&gt;`_- PHP  * `Php Code Sniffer &lt;http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/&gt;`_- Javascript  * `Jshint &lt;http://www.jshint.com/&gt;`_  * `Gjslint &lt;https://developers.google.com/closure/utilities/&gt;`_- JPEG  * Custom via `Jpegtran &lt;http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/raring/man1/jpegtran.1.html&gt;`_- PNG  * Custom via `Pngcrush &lt;http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/raring/man1/pngcrush.1.html&gt;`_  * Custom via `Optipng &lt;http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/raring/man1/optipng.1.html&gt;`_- RST  * Via `rst2html.py (docutils) &lt;http://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html&gt;`_- JSON  * Via python `json.tool module &lt;http://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html&gt;`_- YAML  * `yamllint &lt;https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint&gt;`_- INI  * Custom via `ConfigParser module &lt;http://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html&gt;`_- HTML  * `HTML-Linter &lt;https://github.com/deezer/html-linter&gt;`_  * `Tidy &lt;https://w3c.github.io/tidy-html5/&gt;`_ with preprocessing from `template-remover &lt;https://github.com/deezer/html-linter&gt;`_- Ruby  * `ruby-lint &lt;https://github.com/yorickpeterse/ruby-lint&gt;`_  * `rubocop &lt;https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop&gt;`_- Java  * `PMD &lt;http://pmd.sourceforge.net/&gt;`_ (it requires to put the script run.sh in your PATH)  * `Checkstyle &lt;http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/&gt;`_- Coffeescript  * `coffeelint &lt;http://www.coffeelint.org/&gt;`_- C++  * `cpplint &lt;https://github.com/google/styleguide/tree/gh-pages/cpplint&gt;`_Example use-----------Below is the simplest call, for a detailed list, see the help::  $ git lint  Linting file: src/html/main.js  Line 13, E:0110: Line too long (328 characters).  Line 31, E:0001: Extra space at end of line  src/html/main.js: line 75, col 11, ['location'] is better written in dot notation.  Linting file: src/html/main.css  src/html/main.css: line 1, col 135, Warning - Duplicate property 'margin' found.  Linting file: api.py  api.py:6: [C0301(line-too-long), ] Line too long (87/80)  api.py:6: [R0913(too-many-arguments), callMethod] Too many arguments (6/5)  api.py:6: [C0103(invalid-name), callMethod] Invalid function name &quot;callMethod&quot;By default git lint only reports problems with the modified lines(with the exception of some linters that check that the whole file is sound).To force displaying all the output from the linters use the -f option.Installation------------You can install, upgrade or uninstall git-lint with these commands::  $ pip install git-lint  $ pip install --upgrade git-lint  $ pip uninstall git-lintConfiguration-------------Git-lint comes with a default configuration that includes all the linters listedabove. If you don't like that list you can write your own configuration and putit in a file called `.gitlint.yaml` in the root of your repository. You can copythe file https://github.com/sk-/git-lint/blob/master/gitlint/configs/config.yamlto your repo and modify it.If you add a new linter or add a new flag to any of the commands, pleaseshare that with us, so we can integrate those changes.The configuration support two variables for the command, requirements andarguments:* {REPO_HOME}: the root of your repo.* {DEFAULT_CONFIGS}: the location of the default config files.If you need to include strings like `{}` or `{foo}` in your command, you need todouble the braces as in `{{}}` or `{{foo}}`.Git Configuration-----------------git-lint comes with a pre-commit hook for git. To install it for your repoexecute::  $ ln -s `which pre-commit.git-lint.sh` $PATH_TO_YOUR_REPO/.git/hooks/pre-commitor if you want to install it globally execute instead::  $ ln -s `which pre-commit.git-lint.sh` /usr/share/git-core/templates/hooks/pre-commitMercurial Configuration-----------------------To make available git-lint with a better name in mercurial you have to add the followingto your .hgrc configuration::  [alias]  lint = !git-lint $@To add a pre-commit hook add the following::  [hooks]  pretxncommit.hglint = pre-commit.hg-lint.sh &gt; `tty`The hook above has a hack to display the output of the command. Additionally,as mercurial does not provide (AFAIK) any way to skip a hook, if you want to force a commitwith linter warnings execute the commit command as follow::  $ NO_VERIFY=1 hg commit ...Note though that mercurial heavily uses commit to leverage all of their commands/extensions.I've found that setting any sort of precommit hook will get on your way when using commonactions as ``rebase`` or ``shelve``.Limitations-----------In some cases a change will trigger a warning in another line. Those cases areunfortunately not handled by git-lint, as it only reports those lines that weremodified. Fully supporting this use case would require running the linters twiceand reporting only the new lines. The most common case in which this occurs is withunused imports or variables. Let's say we have the following piece of code::  import foo  foo.bar()If you remove the second line, git-lint will not complain as the warning is for line1, which was not modified.Python Versions---------------Python 2.7 is supported, and it should also work for Python 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4.Python 2.6 is not supported because of the lack of subprocess.check_output.Development-----------Help for this project is more than welcomed, so feel free to create an issue orto send a pull request via http://github.com/sk-/git-lint.Tests are run using nose, either with::  $ python setup.py nosetests  $ nosetestsThis same tool is run for every commit, so errors and style problems are caughtearly.Adding a linter---------------Just need to configure the file gitlint/config.yaml. I hope the syntax is selfexplanatory. (Note to myself: don't be so lazy and write a proper doc for this.)TODOS and Possible Features---------------------------* Support directories as arguments* Provide a man page so 'git help lint' and 'git lint --help' work. I already  have a script for converting the Usage to a man page, but I still need to  figure out how to install it on the system.* Allow to run a command or function when setting up the linter? These can be  achieved now by running a bash script wrapping the linter. The rationale for  this is that some linters, like jshint, only allow options to be in a  configuration file. This is done at the moment via scripts present in the  folder linters.* Decide what linter to use based on the whole filename or even in the filetype,  as returned by the command file.* Provide better options for colorizing the output, and maybe a way to disable  it. Also detect if colors are supported or if it is a tty.* Add support for more version control systems (svn, perforce). This should be  easy, it's just a matter of implementing the functions defined in  gitlint/git.py or gitlint/hg.py.* Support windows.Contributors============* `Rovanion Luckey &lt;https://github.com/Rovanion&gt;`_* `Radek Simko &lt;https://github.com/radeksimko&gt;`_* `Adrien Verg√© &lt;https://github.com/adrienverge&gt;`_* `Rob Rodrigues &lt;https://github.com/irialad&gt;`_* `Alex LordThorsen &lt;https://github.com/rawrgulmuffins&gt;`_Changelog=========v0.1.2 (2018-05-24)-------------------* Fixed race condition when creating cache directories.v0.1.1 (2018-05-15)-------------------* Fixed futures dependency not working corectly in Python 3.v0.1.0 (2018-02-26)-------------------* Fixed setup in some systems due to default encodings.* Changed version to use semantic versioning.
