	<longdescription># Pallet SimulatorPallet Simulator is a Python package that provides functionalities for visualizing pallets inside orders and simulatingtheir stability.## InstallationYou can install the Pallet Simulator package using pip:``` pip install pallet-sim```## UsagePlease refer to the examples folder for detailed examples on how to use the Pallet Simulator. The examples demonstratehow to visualize pallets within orders and simulate their stability.## Data StructuresThe Pallet Simulator uses a JSON-based data structure to represent orders. An order object contains the followingfields:``` json{    &quot;orderID&quot;: &quot;order_id&quot;,    &quot;pallets&quot;: [        {            &quot;palletNr&quot;: &quot;palletNr&quot;,            &quot;palletType&quot;: &quot;EURO_PALLET&quot;,            &quot;palletDimension&quot;: {                &quot;x&quot;: 800.0,                &quot;y&quot;: 1200.0            },            &quot;boxes&quot;: [                {                    &quot;product_code&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,                    &quot;anchor&quot;: {                        &quot;x&quot;: 313.0,                        &quot;y&quot;: 606.0,                        &quot;z&quot;: 0.0                    },                    &quot;dimension&quot;: {                        &quot;x&quot;: 159.0,                        &quot;y&quot;: 298.0,                        &quot;z&quot;: 211.0                    },                    &quot;approach&quot;: &quot;9&quot;                }            ]        }    ],    &quot;articles&quot;: {        &quot;0&quot;: {            &quot;description&quot;: &quot;description&quot;,            &quot;weight&quot;: 5054.0,            &quot;shippingGroup&quot;: &quot;A&quot;        }    }}```In this structure, an order consists of multiple pallets, each identified by a palletNr. Each pallet has a type(palletType), dimensions (palletDimension), and a list of boxes (boxes). Each box is defined by a product code(product_code), anchor coordinates (anchor), dimensions (dimension), and an approach value (approach).The articles field represents the articles or products included in the order. Each article is identified by a numerickey (e.g., &quot;0&quot;) and has a description, weight, and shipping group.The Pallet Simulator utilizes this order structure to generate visual representations of pallets and perform stabilitysimulations.Feel free to modify and adapt this structure based on your specific requirements and use cases.For more details on how to use the Pallet Simulator, please refer to the documentation and examples provided with thepackage.Example files are located under pallet_data/generic_data.## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
