	<longdescription>scqubits is an open-source Python library for simulating superconducting qubits. It ismeant to give the user a convenient way to obtain energy spectra of commonsuperconducting qubits, plot energy levels as a function of external parameters,calculate matrix elements etc. The library further provides an interface to QuTiP,making it easy to work with composite Hilbert spaces consisting of coupledsuperconducting qubits and harmonic modes. Internally, numerics within scqubits iscarried out with the help of Numpy and Scipy; plotting capabilities rely onMatplotlib.If scqubits is helpful to you in your research, please support its continueddevelopment and maintenance. Use of scqubits in research publications isappropriately acknowledged by citing:Peter Groszkowski and Jens Koch, 'scqubits:  a Python package for superconducting qubits',Quantum 5, 583 (2021). https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-11-17-583/</longdescription>
