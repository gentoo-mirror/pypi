	<longdescription>## /etc/hosts provider for octoDNSAn [octoDNS](https://github.com/octodns/octodns/) provider that creates a &quot;best effort&quot; static/emergency content that can be used in /etc/hosts to resolve things. A, AAAA records are supported and ALIAS and CNAME records will be included when they can be mapped within the zone.### Installation#### Command line```pip install octodns_etchosts```#### requirements.txt/setup.pyPinning specific versions or SHAs is recommended to avoid unplanned upgrades.##### Versions```# Start with the latest versions and don't just copy what's hereoctodns==0.9.14octodns_etchosts==0.0.1```##### SHAs```# Start with the latest/specific versions and don't just copy what's here-e git+https://git@github.com/octodns/octodns.git@9da19749e28f68407a1c246dfdf65663cdc1c422#egg=octodns-e git+https://git@github.com/octodns/octodns-etchosts.git@ec9661f8b335241ae4746eea467a8509205e6a30#egg=octodns_etchosts```### Configuration```yamlproviders:  etchosts:    class: octodns_etchosts.EtcHostsProvider    # The output director for the hosts file &lt;zone&gt;.hosts    directory: ./hosts```### Support Information#### RecordsEtcHostsProvider supports A and AAAA, and has partial support for tracing ALIAS and CNAME records when they can be resolved within the zone.#### DynamicEtcHostsProvider does not support dynamic records.### DevelopmentSee the [/script/](/script/) directory for some tools to help with the development process. They generally follow the [Script to rule them all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) pattern. Most useful is `./script/bootstrap` which will create a venv and install both the runtime and development related requirements. It will also hook up a pre-commit hook that covers most of what's run by CI.</longdescription>
