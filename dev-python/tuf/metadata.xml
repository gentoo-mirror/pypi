It protects against various types ofsupply chain attacks and provides resilience to compromise. This repository is a**reference implementation** written in Python. It is intended to conform toversion 1.0 of the [TUFspecification](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/).Python-TUF provides the following APIs:  * [`tuf.api.metadata`](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/tuf.api.html),    a &quot;low-level&quot; API, designed to provide easy and safe access to TUF    metadata and to handle (de)serialization from/to files.  * [`tuf.ngclient`](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/tuf.ngclient.html),    a client implementation built on top of the metadata API.  * `tuf.repository`, a repository library also built on top of the metadata    API. This module is currently not considered part of python-tuf stable API.The reference implementation strives to be a readable guide and demonstrationfor those working on implementing TUF in their own languages, environments, orupdate systems.About The Update Framework--------------------------The Update Framework (TUF) design helps developers maintain the security of asoftware update system, even against attackers that compromise the repositoryor signing keys.TUF provides a flexible[specification](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md)defining functionality that developers can use in any software update system orre-implement to fit their needs.TUF is hosted by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) aspart of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF)and its design is [used in production](https://theupdateframework.io/adoptions/)by various tech companies and open source organizations. A variant of TUFcalled [Uptane](https://uptane.github.io/) is used to secure over-the-airupdates in automobiles.Please see [TUF's website](https://theupdateframework.com/) for more information about TUF!Documentation-------------* [Introduction to TUF's Design](https://theupdateframework.io/overview/)* [The TUF Specification](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/)* [Developer documentation](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/), including  [API reference](    https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/api-reference.html)* [Usage examples](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/tree/develop/examples/)* [Governance](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/blob/develop/docs/GOVERNANCE.md)and [Maintainers](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/blob/develop/docs/MAINTAINERS.txt)for the reference implementation* [Miscellaneous Docs](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/tree/develop/docs)* [Python-TUF development blog](https://theupdateframework.github.io/python-tuf/)Contact-------Questions, feedback, and suggestions are welcomed on our low volume [mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/theupdateframework) orthe [#tuf](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C8NMD3QJ3) channel on [CNCFSlack](https://slack.cncf.io/).We strive to make the specification easy to implement, so if you come acrossany inconsistencies or experience any difficulty, do let us know by sending anemail, or by reporting an issue in the GitHub [specificationrepo](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/issues).Security Issues and Bugs------------------------See [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)License-------This work is [dual-licensed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-licensing) anddistributed under the (1) MIT License and (2) Apache License, Version 2.0.Please see [LICENSE-MIT](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/blob/develop/LICENSE-MIT)and [LICENSE](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/blob/develop/LICENSE).Acknowledgements----------------This project is hosted by the Linux Foundation under the Cloud Native ComputingFoundation.
