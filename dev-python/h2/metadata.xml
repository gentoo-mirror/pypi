It's written from the ground up to be embeddable in whatever program youchoose to use, ensuring that you can speak HTTP/2 regardless of yourprogramming paradigm.You use it like this:.. code-block:: python    import h2.connection    import h2.config    config = h2.config.H2Configuration()    conn = h2.connection.H2Connection(config=config)    conn.send_headers(stream_id=stream_id, headers=headers)    conn.send_data(stream_id, data)    socket.sendall(conn.data_to_send())    events = conn.receive_data(socket_data)This repository does not provide a parsing layer, a network layer, or any rulesabout concurrency. Instead, it's a purely in-memory solution, defined in termsof data actions and HTTP/2 frames. This is one building block of a full PythonHTTP implementation.To install it, just run:.. code-block:: console    $ python -m pip install h2Documentation=============Documentation is available at https://h2.readthedocs.io .Contributing============``h2`` welcomes contributions from anyone!
