The mainfunctionality includes a generic histogram projection interface, a recursive configuration determinationmodule (including overriding (merging) capabilities), and general utilities (especially for histograms). Itprovides base functionality to the [ALICE jet-hadronanalysis](https://github.com/raymondEhlers/alice-jet-hadron) package. This package provides many examples ofhow pachyderm can be used in various analysis tasks.For further information on the capabilities, see the[docuemntation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pachyderm-heavy-ion/badge/?version=latest).## InstallationPachyderm requires python 3.6 or above. It is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pachyderm/) and canbe installed via pip:```bash$ pip install pachyderm```## DependenciesAll dependencies are specified in the `setup.py` (and will be handled automatically when installed via pip)except for ROOT. The package can be installed without ROOT with limited functionality, but for fullfunctionality, ROOT must be available.### DockerfileThere is a Dockerfile which is used for testing pachyderm with ROOT. It is based on the[Overwatch](https://github.com/raymondEhlers/OVERWATCH) [base dockerimage](https://hub.docker.com/r/rehlers/overwatch-base/) to allow us to avoid redeveloping another containerjust to have ROOT available. It may also be used to run pachyderm if so desired, although such a use casedoesn't seem tremendously useful (which is why the image isn't pushed to docker hub).## DevelopmentI recommend setting up the development environment as follows:```bash# Setup$ poetry install# Setup git pre-commit hooks to reduce errors$ pre-commit install# develop develop develop...```## DocumentationAll classes, functions, etc, should be documented, including with typing information. [Thedocs](https://pachyderm-heavy-ion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are built on each new successful commit. They canalso be built locally using:```bash# Setup$ poetry install# Create the docs$ pushd doc &amp;&amp; make html &amp;&amp; popd# Open the created docs$ open docs/_build/html/index.html```## Name Meaning**PACHYDERM**: **P**hysics **A**nalysis **C**ore for **H**eav**Y**-ions with **D**etermination of (analysis)**E**lements via **R**ecursion and **M**erging.</longdescription>
