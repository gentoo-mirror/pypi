	<longdescription>============================EMDB-SFF Toolkit (``sfftk``)============================.. contents::Introduction============``sfftk`` is a set of utilities that facilitate creation, conversion andmodification of `Electron Microscopy Data Bank - Segmentation File Format(EMDB-SFF) files &lt;https://github.com/emdb-empiar/sfftk/tree/master/sfftk/test_data/sff&gt;`_.EMDB-SFF is an open, community-driven file format to handle annotatedsegmentations and subtomogram averages that facilitates segmentation fileinterchange. It is written in Python and provides both a command-linesuite of commands and a Python API.Audience--------``sfftk`` is primarily targeted but not restricted to biological electronmicroscopists and developers of image segmentation software.License-------``sfftk`` is free and open source software released under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0. Source code iscopyright EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) 2017.Data Model----------``sfftk`` is built to handle EMDB-SFF files. The corresponding schema(``v0.8.0.dev1``) may be found at `https://emdb-empiar.github.io/EMDB-SFF &lt;https://emdb-empiar.github.io/EMDB-SFF&gt;`_.Changes to the schema are welcome for discussion at the *Segmentation Working Group*at `https://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/segtrans-wg&lt;https://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/segtrans-wg&gt;`_... _supported_formats:Supported Formats-----------------The following file formats are currently supported (in alphabetical order ofextensions):-  Amira Mesh (.am)-  SuRVoS (.h5; experimental support)-  CCP4 Masks (.map)-  IMOD (.mod)-  Segger (.seg)-  Stereolithography (.stl)-  Amira HyperSurface (.surf)Contact-------Any questions or comments should be addressed to ``pkorir at ebi dot ac dot uk``.Publications------------.. Please cite the  whenever ``sfftk`` is used in a publication:.. .. note::..    Article to be addedThe EMDB-SFF data model is the result of various community consultations whichare published in the following articles:-  `Patwardhan, Ardan, Robert Brandt, Sarah J.

The only dependencythat may be needed is ``numpy`` which can be installed with.. code:: bash pip install numpyPyPI~~~~``sfftk`` is available on PyPI meaning that all that one needs to do is run:.. code:: bash pip install sfftkSource~~~~~~The ``sfftk`` source is available from Github `https://github.com/emdb-empiar/sfftk &lt;https://github.com/emdb-empiar/sfftk&gt;`_.Features========``sfftk`` has two principal functions:- `convert` application-specific segmentation file format (AS-SFF) files to EMDB-SFF;- `annotate` EMDB-SFF files against known ontologies.Conversion----------Segmentation files may be converted to EMDB-SFF files using the ``convert``command... code:: bash sff convert file.am -o file.sffFor a full description of how to perform conversion, please see the`guide to format conversion &lt;https://sfftk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/converting.html&gt;`_.Annotation----------Annotation is performed using the ``notes`` utility on EMDB-SFF files... code:: bash sff notes show -H file.sff``sfftk`` provides a simple set of tools to allow `viewing, searching andmodifying annotations` associated with the segmentation and individualsegments. The added annotations should be either from a public ontology or bean accession from a public database.See the `guide to annotating segmentations &lt;https://sfftk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/annotating.html&gt;`_ for a fulltreatment.Miscellaneous-------------``sfftk`` may also be used for several miscellaneous operations such as:-  `Viewing segmentation metadata &lt;https://sfftk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/misc.html#viewing-file-metadata&gt;`_-  `Prepping segmentations &lt;https://sfftk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/misc.html#prepping-segmentation-files&gt;`_ before conversion to EMDB-SFF-  `Setting configurations &lt;https://sfftk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/misc.html#setting-configurations&gt;`_ that affect how ``sfftk`` works-  `Running unit tests &lt;https://sfftk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/misc.html#running-unit-tests&gt;`_  with the ``tests`` commandMore information on this can be found in the `guide to miscellaneous operations &lt;https://sfftk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/misc.html&gt;`_.Developing with ``sfftk``-------------------------``sfftk`` is developed as a set of decoupled packages providing the variousfunctionality. The main classes involved are found in the `sfftkrw &lt;https://sfftk-rw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_ package.There is also a `guide to developing with sfftk &lt;https://sfftk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing.html&gt;`_ whichprovides useful instructions.Extending ``sfftk``-------------------``sfftk`` has built with extensibility in mind. It is anticipated that mostextension will take the form of supporting additional file formats. Pleaseread the `guide to extending sfftk &lt;https://sfftk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending.html&gt;`_ to learn how to dothis.</longdescription>
