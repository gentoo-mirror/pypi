	<longdescription>A Python package for finite difference derivatives in any number of dimensions.        Features:         * Differentiate arrays of any number of dimensions along any axis        * Partial derivatives of any desired order        * Accuracy order can be specified        * Accurate treatment of grid boundary        * Includes standard operators from vector calculus like gradient, divergence and curl        * Can handle uniform and non-uniform grids        * Can handle arbitrary linear combinations of derivatives with constant and variable coefficients        * Fully vectorized for speed        * Calculate raw finite difference coefficients for any order and accuracy for uniform and non-uniform grids    </longdescription>
