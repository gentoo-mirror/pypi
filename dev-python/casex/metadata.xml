	<longdescription>Implementation of the mathematics behind JARUS WG-6 SORA Annex F.Overview--------This package was created to support the mathematical models used to derivethe iGRC tables and supporting material found in JARUS WG-6 SORA Annex F.It implements the models for computing critical areas, effect of obstacles,ballistic descent, effect of explosions and deflagration that are being usedin Annex F. It also includes easy access to the specific choice of parametersthat are used in Annex F. Finally, this package can be used for easily recreating some of the figures foundin Annex F.The mathematical models implemented in the package are the results of thecombined effort of the Quantitative Methods subgroup under Working Group 6.Installation------------To install CasEx, simply run the following command in your terminal.    pip install casexDocumentation-------------The full documentation for CasEx is located at https://casex.readthedocs.io/.License-------This toolbox is under license CC BY 4.0.
