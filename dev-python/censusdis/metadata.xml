If you want to try it out for yourself, the README.mdcontains links that let you run the tutorial notebooks live on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) in your browser without needing to set up alocal development environment or download or install any code.## Introduction `censusdis` is a package for discovering, loading, analyzing, and computingdiversity, integration, and segregation metricsto U.S. Census demographic data. It is designed to be intuitive and Pythonic,but give users access to the full collection of data and maps the US Censuspublishes via their APIs. It also avoids hard-coding metadataabout U.S. Census variables, such as their names, types, andhierarchies in groups. Instead, it queries this from the U.S. Census API. This allows it to operate over a large setof datasets and years, likely including many that don'texist as of time of this writing. It also integratesdownloading and merging the geometry of geographic geometries to make plotting data and derived metrics simpleand easy. Finally, it interacts with the `divintseg`package to compute diversity and integration metrics.The design goal of `censusdis` are discussed in moredetail in [design-goals.md](./design-goals.md).&gt; ### I'm not sure I get it. Show me what it can do.&gt; &gt; The [Nationwide Diversity and Integration](./notebooks/Nationwide%20Diversity%20and%20Integration.ipynb)&gt; notebook demonstrates how we can download, process, and &gt; plot a large amount of US Census demographic data quickly&gt; and easily to produce compelling results with just a few&gt; lines of code.&gt; ### I'm sold! I want to dive right in!&gt; &gt; To get straight to installing and trying out&gt; code hop over to our &gt; [Getting Started](https://censusdis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)&gt; guide.`censusdis` lets you quickly and easily load US Census data and make plots like this one:![Median income by block group in GA](docs/_static/images/sample02.png)We downloaded the data behind this plot, includingthe geometry of all the block groups, with asingle call:```pythonimport censusdis.data as cedfrom censusdis.states import STATE_GA# This is a census variable for median household income.# See https://api.census.gov/data/2020/acs/acs5/variables/B19013_001E.htmlMEDIAN_HOUSEHOLD_INCOME_VARIABLE = &quot;B19013_001E&quot;gdf_bg = ced.download(    &quot;acs/acs5&quot;,  # The American Community Survey 5-Year Data    2020,    [&quot;NAME&quot;, MEDIAN_HOUSEHOLD_INCOME_VARIABLE],    state=STATE_GA,    block_group=&quot;*&quot;,    with_geometry=True)```Similarly, we can download data and geographies, do a littleanalysis on our own using familiar [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)data frame operations, and plot graphs like these![Percent of population identifying as white by county](docs/_static/images/sample03.png)![Integration is SoMa](docs/_static/images/sample00.png)## ModulesThe public modules that make up the `censusdis` package are| Module                | Description                                                                                                   ||-----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| `censusdis.geography` | Code for managing geography hierarchies in which census data is organized.                                    | | `censusdis.data`      | Code for fetching data from the US Census API, including managing datasets, groups, and variable hierarchies. || `censusdis.maps`      | Code for downloading map data from the US, caching it locally, and using it to render maps.                   || `censusdis.states`    | Constants defining the US States.
