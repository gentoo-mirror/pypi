	<longdescription># diycratebox.com for linux[![Build](https://github.com/jheld/diycrate/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jheld/diycrate/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild+branch%3Amaster)## Installation on Ubuntu```bashsudo apt install libffi-dev libssl-dev python3-pip# you may want to create a virtual environmentsudo python3 setup.py install```## ConfigurationInstallation will create an empty ~/.config/diycrate/box.iniThis file will be overwritten and will contain run time specific information!## Self-signed CertificateCurrently, in order for your machine to operate as a listener/hook against the oauth2 process with Box, you willhave to run a webserver -- which we provide for you in this application, to handle all of that, automatically.However, in order for your browser (and your sanity), you will want to create a certificate. When running on yourlocal  machine/localhost, you will need to create a self-signed certificate.Let's Encrypt has a nice write-up on how to do that: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/#making-and-trusting-your-own-certificates## Install RedisThis application requires the use of redis oauth2 credential &quot;storage&quot; as well as meta data for the caching &amp; statesof files against box.```bashsudo apt install redis-server```## Run the appCurrently there is no default out-of-the-box working configuration file. This is partly due to currently (should the user not setup their own) using `diycrate.xyz` (I host it) for a part of the oauth2 dance. It isn't &quot;hard&quot; to setup your own, nor is it hard to use the &quot;always running, you can plug into&quot; mine, but it's not exactly documented.```bashdiycrate_app --cacert_pem_path /path/to/cert.pem --privkey_pem_path /path/to/privkey.pem```Run `diycrate_app --help` for more CLI information</longdescription>
