To install for current user:.. code-block:: shell    pip3 install adafruit-blinka-bleioTo install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):.. code-block:: shell    sudo pip3 install adafruit-blinka-bleioTo install in a virtual environment in your current project:.. code-block:: shell    mkdir project-name &amp;&amp; cd project-name    python3 -m venv .env    source .env/bin/activate    pip3 install adafruit-blinka-bleioSupport for Duplicate Advertisement scanning on Linux=====================================================.. note::   Read this section if you are using advertising to transmit changing   data and need to receive all advertisements to receive this data.   One example of using advertising for data is described in the Adafruit Learn Guide   `Bluetooth LE Sensor Nodes to Raspberry Pi WiFi Bridge   &lt;https://learn.adafruit.com/bluetooth-le-broadcastnet-sensor-node-raspberry-pi-wifi-bridge&gt;`_.The regular Linux kernel ``bluez`` driver is set up to suppressmultiple advertisements sent from the same BLE device.  As of thiswriting, this cannot be changed.  If you are using BLE advertisementsto send changing data that you retrieve by scanning, thede-duplication can cause you to lose data when scanning via ``bleak``.To get around this problem, this library can instead look at raw BLEscanning data using the ``hcidump`` and ``hcitool`` tools and avoidgoing through the kernel driver. But this requires special setup.Normally, only root has enough privileges to do see the raw scanningdata.  Since running as root is dangerous, you can instead use Linuxcapabilities to grant ``hcitool`` and ``hcidump`` raw networkaccess. This is very powerful and not something to do casually. Tolimit access we recommend you change file execution permissions torestrict this capability to users in the ``bluetooth`` group.**If you are not using advertising to transmit changing data, you donot need to add these permissions. This library falls back to using**``bleak`` **for regular scanning if** ``hcitool`` **does not havethese extra permissions.**If you **explicitly** want to choose the backend to ensure consistentbehavior, you can do the following:.. code-block:: python    ble = BLERadio()    ble._adapter.ble_backend = &quot;bleak&quot; # Forces bleak even if hcitool works.    # ble._adapter.ble_backend = &quot;hcitool&quot; # Forces hcitool. Raises exception if unavailable.To add yourself to the ``bluetooth`` group do:.. code-block:: shell    sudo usermod -a -G bluetooth &lt;your username&gt;You must then logout and log back in to be in the new group.To set permissions on ``hcitool`` and ``hcidump`` do:.. code-block:: shell    sudo chown :bluetooth /usr/bin/hcitool /usr/bin/hcidump    sudo chmod o-x /usr/bin/hcitool /usr/bin/hcidump    sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' /usr/bin/hcitool    sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' /usr/bin/hcidumpUsage Example=============Do not use this library directly. Use CircuitPython BLE instead:https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE/Contributing============Contributions are welcome! Please read our `Code of Conduct&lt;https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_bleio/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md&gt;`_before contributing to help this project stay welcoming.Documentation=============For information on building library documentation, please check out `this guide &lt;https://learn.adafruit.com/creating-and-sharing-a-circuitpython-library/sharing-our-docs-on-readthedocs#sphinx-5-1&gt;`_.Troubleshooting================Raspberry Pi 3b Rev 1.2^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The Raspberry Pi 3b's BLE chip is connected over UART to the main processor without flow control.This can cause unreliability with BLE. To improve reliability, we can slow the UART. To do so,edit ``/usr/bin/btuart`` and replace the ``921600`` with ``460800``.</longdescription>
