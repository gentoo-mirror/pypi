	<longdescription># Python: Asynchronous client for Salus iT600 devices## For end usersSee https://github.com/jvitkauskas/homeassistant_salus to use this in Home Assistant.FHEM users might be interested in https://github.com/dominikkarall/fhempy which provides subset of functionality.## AboutThis package allows you to control and monitor your Salus iT600 smart home devices locally through Salus UG600 universal gateway. Currently heating thermostats, binary sensors, temperature sensors, covers and switches are supported. You have any other devices and would like to contribute - you are welcome to create an issue or submit a pull request.## Installation```bashpip install pyit600```## Usage - Instantiate the IT600Gateway device with local ip address and EUID of your gateway. You can find EUID written down on the bottom of your gateway (eg. `001E5E0D32906128`). - Status can be polled using the `poll_status()` command. - Callbacks to be notified of state updates can be added with the `add_climate_update_callback(method)` or `add_sensor_update_callback(method)` method.### Basic example```pythonasync with IT600Gateway(host=args.host, euid=args.euid) as gateway:await gateway.connect()await gateway.poll_status()climate_devices = gateway.get_climate_devices()print(&quot;All climate devices:&quot;)print(repr(climate_devices))for climate_device_id in climate_devices:print(f&quot;Climate device {climate_device_id} status:&quot;)print(repr(climate_devices.get(climate_device_id)))print(f&quot;Setting heating device {climate_device_id} temperature to 21 degrees celsius&quot;)await gateway.set_climate_device_temperature(climate_device_id, 21)```### Supported devicesThermostats:* HTRP-RF(50)* TS600* VS10WRF/VS10BRF* VS20WRF/VS20BRF* SQ610* SQ610RF* FC600Binary sensors:* SW600* WLS600* OS600* SD600 (sometimes gateway may not expose required information for these devices to be detected, reason is unknown)* TRV10RFM (only heating state on/off)* RX10RF (only heating state on/off)Temperature sensors:* PS600Switch devices:* SPE600* RS600* SR600Cover devices:* RS600### Unsupported devicesButtons perform actions only in Salus Smart Home app:* SB600* CSB600### Untested devicesThese switch devices have not been tested, but may work:* SP600These binary sensors have not been tested, but may work:* MS600### TroubleshootingIf you can't connect using EUID written down on the bottom of your gateway (which looks something like `001E5E0D32906128`), try using `0000000000000000` as EUID.Also check if you have &quot;Local Wifi Mode&quot; enabled:* Open Smart Home app on your phone* Sign in* Double tap your Gateway to open info screen* Press gear icon to enter configuration* Scroll down a bit and check if &quot;Disable Local WiFi Mode&quot; is set to &quot;No&quot;* Scroll all the way down and save settings* Restart Gateway by unplugging/plugging USB power### ContributingIf you want to help to get your device supported, open GitHub issue and add your device model number and output of `main.py` program. Be sure to run this program with --debug option.</longdescription>
