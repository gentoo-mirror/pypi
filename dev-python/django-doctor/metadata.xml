	<longdescription># django-doctor[![pypi-image]][pypi][![semver-image]][semver]**Django code quality assistant. Offline version of https://django.doctor**Find and fix around 40 breaches of Django best practice - helping you build world-class websites, release faster, and reduce dev costs.---## Installation    $ pip install django-doctor## FixRun the fix suggestion wizard like so:    $ django_doctor fixThis runs a simple server on http://localhost:9000 and opens the wizard in your browser:![](https://i.imgur.com/GMcuQFl.png)You then accept or reject the suggestions![](https://i.imgur.com/0FRqflf.png)And ultimately the selected changes are saved to your file system![](https://i.imgur.com/rMeNH4n.png)You can change the address:$ django_doctor fix --address=0.0.0.0 --port=9001Your virtual environment directory is automatically skipped. To exclude other directories use the `--ignore` flag:    $ django_doctor fix --ignore=foo # single directory    $ django_doctor fix --ignore=foo --ignore=bar # multiple directoriesYou can also specify a directory to check instead of running on the current working directory. To run on only on &quot;my_app&quot; and &quot;my_other_app&quot;:$ django_doctor fix my_app my_other_app## CheckYou can see suggested changes in your shell:    $ django_doctor check![](https://i.imgur.com/jb5Q9P3.png)Consider running this as a pre-commit hook, or on your CI to prevent new Django anti-patterns from being merged.You can also use `--ignore` the same as with the `fix` command.## ConfigurationYou turn checks on/off with `--disable` and `--enable`. See [here](https://django.doctor/config) for the codenames of the checks.## Troubleshooting### DebuggingTry running `django_doctor` in verbose mode by adding `--log-level=debug` when executing the `fix` or `check` commands.### PipenvIf you're using `pipenv` you may need to do `pipenv install django-doctor --pre` because:- `django-doctor` depends on [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/)- `black` only releases pre-releases- `pipenv` ignores pre-releases[pypi-image]: https://badge.fury.io/py/django-doctor.svg[pypi]: https://badge.fury.io/py/django-doctor[semver-image]: https://img.shields.io/badge/Versioning%20strategy-SemVer-5FBB1C.svg[semver]: https://semver.org## SupportChat with us on https://django.doctor if you have any problems or have a feature request## GitHub integrationDjango Doctor has GitHub integration.
