This approach allowshuge savings in computational time and memory requirements compared to usingdense matrix representations.### Dependencies- Python 2.7, Python &gt;=3.5- Numpy &gt;= 1.16.3- Scipy &gt;= 1.0- Cython &gt;= 0.29- soft dependencies:    - matplotlib: for demos and tools that make use of plotting functions### DistributionBinary wheels are provided for Python &gt;=3.5 for linux, windows and mac, as well as for x86 and ARM architectures.For all systems, for which no wheels are provided, you may still install fastmat from the soruce distribution.### Authors &amp; Contact Information- Sebastian Semper | sebastian.semper@tu-ilmenau.de  Technische Universität Ilmenau, Institute for Mathematics, EMS Group- Christoph Wagner | christoph.wagner@tu-ilmenau.de  Technische Universität Ilmenau, Institute for Information Technology, EMS Group- **&lt;https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/it-ems/&gt;**## Citation / AcknowledgementsIf you use fastmat, or parts of it, for commercial purposes you are requiredto acknowledge the use of fastmat visibly to all users of your work and put areference to the project and the EMS Group at TU Ilmenau.If you use fastmat for your scientific work you are required to mention theEMS Group at TU Ilmenau and cite the following publication affiliated with theproject: &gt; Christoph W. Wagner and Sebastian Semper and Jan Kirchhof, _fastmat: Efficient linear transforms in Python_, &gt; SoftwareX, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2022.101013 &gt;```    @article{Wagner_2022,        doi = {10.1016/j.softx.2022.101013},        url = {https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.softx.2022.101013},        year = {2022},        month = {jun},        publisher = {Elsevier {BV}},        volume = {18},        pages = {101013},        author = {Christoph W.

Lately it also has beenseen on ARM cores coming in a Xilinx ZYNQ FPGA SoC shell. We encourage you togo ahead trying other platforms as the aforementioned as well and are veryhappy if you share your experience with us, allowing us to keep the listupdated.### Installing with pip:fastmat is included in the Python Package Index (PyPI) and can be installedfrom the commandline by running one easy and straightforward command:    `pip install fastmat`When installing with pip all dependencies of the package will be installedalong. With release 0.1.1 python wheels will be offered for many versionsgreatly improving installation time and effort.#### Bulding from sourceBuilding binaries has been developed and tested for the use### Manually installing from source- download the source distribution from our github repository:    https://github.com/EMS-TU-Ilmenau/fastmat/archive/stable.zip- unpack its contents and navigate to the project root directory- run `pip install .` to install fastmat on your computer- you may also install fastmat without pip, using the offered makefile:    * type `make install` to install fastmat on your computer    * If you intend to install the package locally for your user type      `make install MODE=--user` instead    * You may add a version specifier for all `make` targets that directly or indirectly invoke Python:      `make install PYTHON=python2`      `make compile PYTHON=python3`    * If you only would like to compile the package to use it from this local      directory without installing it, type `make compile`    * An uninstallation of a previously run `make install`is possible, provided the installation log file `setup.files` has been preserved      Invoking `make uninstall` without a local `setup.files` causes another installation for generating the setup file log prior to uninstalling- **NOTE: Windows users**  If you intent on building fastmat from source on a windows platform, make sure you have installed a c compiler environment and make interpreter. One way to accomplish this is to install these tools for Python 2.7 (you may also chose different ones, of course):    * Intel Distribution for Python 2.7    * Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler 9.0 for Python 2.7    * GNU make for Windows 3.81 or newer    * depending on your system: The relevant header files## DemosFeel free to have a look at the demos in the `demo/` directory of the sourcedistribution. Please make sure to have fastmat already installed when runningthese.Please note that the edgeDetect demo requires the Python Imaging Library (PIL)installed and the SAFT demos do compile a cython-core of a user defined matrixclass beforehand thus having a delaying the first time they're executed.## Documentation / HELP !Please have a look at the documentation, which is included in the sourcedistribution at github or may be built locally on your machine by running    `make doc`If you experience any trouble please do not hesitate to contact us or to openan issue on our github projectpage: https://github.com/EMS-TU-Ilmenau/fastmat### FAQPlease check out our project documentation at [readthedocs](https://fastmat.readthedocs.io/).#### Windows: Installation fails with various &quot;file not found&quot; errorsOften, this is caused by missing header files. Unfortunately windows shipswithout a c-compiler and the header files necessary to compile native binarycode. If you use the Intel Distribution for Python this can be resolved byinstalling the Visual Studio Build tools with the version as recommended bythe version of the Intel Distribution for Python that you are using.#### Issue not resolved yet?Please contact us or leave your bug report in the *issue* section.
