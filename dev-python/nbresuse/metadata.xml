This is displayed in themain toolbar in the notebook itself, refreshing every 5s.## InstallationYou can currently install this package from PyPI.```bashpip install nbresuse```**If your notebook version is &lt; 5.3**, you need to enable the extension manually.```jupyter serverextension enable --py nbresuse --sys-prefixjupyter nbextension install --py nbresuse --sys-prefixjupyter nbextension enable --py nbresuse --sys-prefix```## Configuration### Memory Limit`nbresuse` can display a memory limit (but not enforce it). You can set thisin several ways:1. `MEM_LIMIT` environment variable. This is set by [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/)   if using a spawner that supports it.2. In the commandline when starting `jupyter notebook`, as `--ResourceUseDisplay.mem_limit`.3. In your Jupyter notebook [traitlets](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) config fileThe limit needs to be set as an integer in Bytes.### Memory usage warning threshold![Screenshot with memory warning](warn-screenshot.png)The background of the resource display can be changed to red when the user is near a memory limit.The threshold for this warning can be configured as a fraction of the memory limit.If you want to flash the warning to the user when they are within 10% of the memory limit, youcan set the parameter `--ResourceUseDisplay.mem_warning_threshold=0.1`.### CPU Usage`nbresuse` can also track CPU usage and report a `cpu_percent` value as part of the `/metrics` response.You can set the `cpu_limit` in several ways:1. `CPU_LIMIT` environment variable. This is set by [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/)   if using a spawner that supports it.2. In the command line when starting `jupyter notebook`, as `--ResourceUseDisplay.cpu_limit`.3. In your Jupyter notebook [traitlets](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) config fileThe limit corresponds to the number of cpus the user has access to, but does not enforce it.Additionally, you can set the `track_cpu_percent` trait to enable CPU usage tracking (disabled by default):```pythonc = get_config()c.NotebookApp.ResourceUseDisplay.track_cpu_percent = True```As a command line argument:```bashjupyter notebook --ResourceUseDisplay.track_cpu_percent=True```## Resources DisplayedCurrently the server extension only reports memory usage (just RSS) and CPU usage. Other metrics will beadded in the future as needed.The notebook extension currently doesn't show CPU usage, only memory usage.## ContributingIf you would like to contribute to the project, please read the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). The `CONTRIBUTING.md` fileexplains how to set up a development installation and how to run the test suite.</longdescription>
