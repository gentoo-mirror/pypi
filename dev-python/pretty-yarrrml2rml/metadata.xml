The translation is based on [RML]((https://rml.io/specs/rml/ &quot;RML Spec&quot;) and [YARRRML]((https://rml.io/yarrrml/spec/ &quot;YARRRML Spec&quot;) specifications.## Limitations:We are working on inlcuding the following features which are not yet implemented:- Translation to [R2RML](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml)- [Named graphs](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/#named-graphs) from R2RML- Functions included using the [FnO](https://fno.io/) Ontology## ExecutionIn order to execute the code run you can download de PyPi module:```bashpython3 -m pip install pretty-yarrrml2rmlpython3 -m pretty_yarrrml2rml -i path_to_input_yarrrml.yml -o path_to_output_rml.rml```If you want to include the module in your implementation:```pythonimport pretty_yarrrml2rmlimport yamlrml_content = pretty_yarrrml2rml.translate(yaml.safe_load(open(&quot;path-to-yarrrml&quot;)))```## AuthorsOntology Engineering Group - Data Integration:- [David Chaves-Fraga](mailto:david.chaves@upm.es)- Luis López Piñero (Final bachelor thesis - v0.1)</longdescription>
