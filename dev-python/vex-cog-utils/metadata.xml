	<longdescription># Vex-Cog-UtilsIf you've come here on PyPI, hello! You're welcome to use this wherever, just be aware it requires ``Red-DiscordBot`` which is not in the requirements due to the circumstances this is used by myself.---Utility functions for the Vex-Cogs repo, for Red-DiscordBotThere is nothing stopping you from using this in your own cogs, however some of the stuff here is geared towards my cogs. I would recommend you pin the version.Docstrings fully document each function.## Versioning``major.minor.patch``Major releases are likely to include breaking changes. There **can** me breaking changes in minor releases. There will be nothing breaking in patch releases.</longdescription>
