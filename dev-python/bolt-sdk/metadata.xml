	<longdescription># Bolt SDKThis SDK provides an authentication solution for programatically interacting with Bolt. It wraps the boto3 interface so project wide integration is as easy as refactoring `import boto3` to `import bolt as boto3`.The package affects the signing and routing protocol of the boto3 S3 client, therefore any non S3 clients created through this SDK will be un-affected by the wrapper.## PrerequisitesThe minimum supported version of Python is version 3.## Installation```bashpython3 -m pip install bolt-sdk```## ConfigurationFor the client to work it must have knowledge of Bolt's *service discovery url* (`BOLT_URL`)These are parameterized by the *region* of Bolt's deployment. A preferred *availability zone ID* can also be provided for AZ-aware routing.**There are two  ways to expose Bolt's URL to the SDK:**1. Declare the ENV variable: `BOLT_CUSTOM_DOMAIN`, which constructs Bolt URL and hostname based on default naming```bashexport BOLT_CUSTOM_DOMAIN=&quot;example.com&quot;```2. Directly declare the ENV variables: `BOLT_URL``BOLT_URL` must be formatted as follows:`https://&lt;subdomain&gt;{region}&lt;domain&gt;`An example is:`https://bolt.{region}.google.com`Where the `{region}` within the URL is a string literal placeholder that will be replaced by the python sdk```bashexport BOLT_URL=&quot;&lt;url&gt;&quot;```**There are two ways to expose Bolt's region/preferred availability zone to the SDK:**1. If running on an EC2 instance the SDK will by default use that instance's region and zone ID2. With the ENV variables: `AWS_REGION` and `AWS_ZONE_ID`.```bashexport AWS_REGION='&lt;region&gt;'export AWS_ZONE_ID='&lt;az-id&gt;'```## DebuggingImport the default logger and set its level to DEBUG`logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)`## TestsBasic integration tests are provided for the modified Session/Client interfaces. They must be run in an environment with a properly configured Bolt deployment accessible.```bashpython3 tests/tests.py```</longdescription>
