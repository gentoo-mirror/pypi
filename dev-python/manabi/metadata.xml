This token is a temporary and  short-lived cryptographic token that contains the file-path as an encrypted  payload.- Both the API and Manabi share a key. In a symmetric shared-key scenario,  encryption can also be employed to verify the data.- The frontend displays a link that includes the ephemeral token along with  the document, allowing users to easily edit it in Word/LO.- When the user clicks the link, the document opens in Word/LO.- Manabi retrieves the token from the request URI, checks its validity, and  proceeds to open the document if the token is verified.- The token is updated and stored as a cookie within Word/LO for future reference.- Due to the ephemeral WebDAV lock, Word/LO must regularly contact Manabi to  refresh the lock. Consequently, we leverage this mechanism to also refresh the  token.**pre_write_hook**: We provide an optional pre-write-hook feature that enhancesthe API's capabilities by adding a versioning system. The hook is invoked withthe token as an argument **prior** to the document being saved using WebDAV-PUT.The API has the ability to verify this token and subsequently create a newversion of the document. Once the hook operation is successfully completed,Manabi takes over and saves the document.A post-write-hook is not implemented, if you need one, please open an issue.## InstallMake sure libsodium exists on the system, for example execute:```bashapk add --no-cache libsodiumapt-get install -y libsodium23```## ConfigCall `manabi-keygen` and add the key to `config[&quot;manabi&quot;][&quot;key&quot;]`. The key isshared between the caluma/alexandria backend and the WebDAV server.`mount_path`Prefix that gets passed to wsgidav, if URL rewrites remove any prefixes use `&quot;/&quot;``lock_storage`The ManabiLockLockStorage forces the WebDav log-timeout to `token-refresh-time / 2``provider_mapping`Extends the FilesystemProvider any will only serve files if the token is valid`pre_write_hook`A hook to enhance the API's capabilities, for example versioning of documents.`middleware_stack`Based on the default middleware_stack but HTTPAuthenticator is replace byManabiAuthenticator, which validates the tokens.`manabi.key`Shared-key between the server that creates tokens to grant access and wsgi-dav`manabi.refresh`How often tokens are refreshed in seconds, we recommend 10 minutes: `600``manabi.initial`The time from the token being generated till it has to be refreshed the firsttime, we recommend 1 minues: `60`. In case tokens leak, for example via cache ona computer, tokens should be expired by the time an adversary gets them.```pythonfrom manabi import ManabiDAVApppostgres_dsn = &quot;dbname=manabi user=manabi host=localhost password=manabi&quot;config = {    &quot;mount_path&quot;: &quot;/dav&quot;,    &quot;lock_storage&quot;: ManabiDbLockStorage(refresh, postgres_dsn),    &quot;provider_mapping&quot;: {        &quot;/&quot;: ManabiProvider(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, pre_write_hook=&quot;http://127.0.0.1/hook&quot;),    },    &quot;middleware_stack&quot;: [        WsgiDavDebugFilter,        ErrorPrinter,        ManabiAuthenticator,        WsgiDavDirBrowser,        RequestResolver,    ],    &quot;manabi&quot;: {        &quot;key&quot;: key,        &quot;refresh&quot;: refresh,        &quot;initial&quot;: settings.MANABI_TOKEN_ACTIVATE_TIMEOUT,    },}dav_app = ManabiDAVApp(config)```# DevEnable dev-env:```bashpyenv install 3.11.4poetry env use $HOME/.pyenv/versions/3.11.4/bin/python3.11poetry installpoetry run python -m manabi.mypy_fixpoetry shelldocker-compose up -d db(cd manabi_django &amp;&amp; ./manage.py migrate manabi_migrations)```## Typing rulesMy typing rules for this project (there are no company rules):- In tests `# type: ignore` is allowed if fixing the issue does not help production-code- In production-code `# type: ignore` is allowed if a manual check happens or  we can guarantee some runtime behavior. For example we guarantee that a  weakref is always valid. Similar to `unsafe` in rust.</longdescription>
