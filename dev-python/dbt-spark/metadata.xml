Organize, cleanse, denormalize, filter, rename, and pre-aggregate the raw data in your warehouse so that it's ready for analysis.## dbt-sparkThe `dbt-spark` package contains all of the code enabling dbt to work with Apache Spark and Databricks. Formore information, consult [the docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/profile-spark).## Getting started- [Install dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/installation)- Read the [introduction](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction/) and [viewpoint](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/about/viewpoint/)## Running locallyA `docker-compose` environment starts a Spark Thrift server and a Postgres database as a Hive Metastore backend.Note: dbt-spark now supports Spark 3.1.1 (formerly on Spark 2.x).The following command would start two docker containers```docker-compose up -d```It will take a bit of time for the instance to start, you can check the logs of the two containers.If the instance doesn't start correctly, try the complete reset command listed below and then try start again.Create a profile like this one:```spark_testing:  target: local  outputs:    local:      type: spark      method: thrift      host: 127.0.0.1      port: 10000      user: dbt      schema: analytics      connect_retries: 5      connect_timeout: 60      retry_all: true```Connecting to the local spark instance:* The Spark UI should be available at [http://localhost:4040/sqlserver/](http://localhost:4040/sqlserver/)* The endpoint for SQL-based testing is at `http://localhost:10000` and can be referenced with the Hive or Spark JDBC drivers using connection string `jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000` and default credentials `dbt`:`dbt`Note that the Hive metastore data is persisted under `./.hive-metastore/`, and the Spark-produced data under `./.spark-warehouse/`. To completely reset you environment run the following:```docker-compose downrm -rf ./.hive-metastore/rm -rf ./.spark-warehouse/```### Reporting bugs and contributing code-   Want to report a bug or request a feature?
