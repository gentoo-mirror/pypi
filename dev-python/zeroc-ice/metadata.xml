	<longdescription>The Internet Communications Engine (Ice) provides a robust, proven platform fordeveloping mission-critical networked applications. Let Ice handle all of thelow-level details such as network connections, serialization, and concurrency sothat you can focus on your application logic.The Ice Python extension makes the full Ice feature set available to Pythondevelopers, including:* Client and server support* Synchronous and asynchronous invocations* Communicate via TCP, SSL, UDP, multicast, and WebSocket transports* Supports IPv4 and IPv6* Intuitive mapping from Slice to PythonTo give you an idea of what it's like to use Ice in Python, here's a completeprogram that tests whether a remote Ice object is available:::  import sys, Ice  with Ice.initialize(sys.argv) as communicator:      obj = communicator.stringToProxy(&quot;hello:tcp -h myhost.mydomain.com -p 10000&quot;)      obj.ice_ping()With support for Python2 and Python3, you can easily add Ice to your existingPython infrastructure and discover how easy it is to build distributedapplications with Ice.Package Contents----------------This package includes the Ice extension for Python, the standard Slicedefinition files, and the Slice-to-Python compiler. You will need to install afull Ice distribution if you want to use other Ice language mappings, or Iceservices such as IceGrid, IceStorm and Glacier2.Installation------------We recommend using ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` to install this package. If youinstall using ``python setup.py install`` instead, be aware that the Slice-to-Python compiler (``slice2py``) will not be available.By default, Ice is built statically with the package. On Linux and macOS, youcan instead build the package with the system-installed Ice shared libraries.To do so, you can provide the ```--with-installed-ice``` option to```setup.py``` install. With ```pip```, you should pass the```--install-option=&quot;--with-installed-ice&quot;``` option to pip install.Home Page---------Visit `ZeroC's home page &lt;https://zeroc.com&gt;`_ for the latest news andinformation about Ice.Documentation-------------We provide extensive `online documentation&lt;https://doc.zeroc.com/ice/3.7&gt;`_ for Ice, the Python extension, and theother Ice language mappings and services.Support-------Join us on our `user forums &lt;https://zeroc.com/forums/forum.php&gt;`_ if you havequestions about Ice.</longdescription>
