The public interface  consists of a single function.- Automatic file type recognition.- OpenBabel as an engine to parse formats, but other engines can be  easily implemented.- Easily extensible to new formats.- Current support for PDB, Mol2 and XYZ files.Example+++++++.. code:: python import read_structure_step seamm_structure = read_structure_step.read(&quot;spc.xyz&quot;)Acknowledgements----------------This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `molssi-seamm/cookiecutter-seamm-plugin`_ project template... _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`molssi-seamm/cookiecutter-seamm-plugin`: https://github.com/molssi-seamm/cookiecutter-seamm-pluginDeveloped by the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI_),which receives funding from the `National Science Foundation`_ underaward ACI-1547580.. _MolSSI: https://www.molssi.org.. _`National Science Foundation`: https://www.nsf.gov=======History=======2023.1.24 -- Added handler for XYZ files and added properties  * Added a custom handler for XYZ files to cope with some of the variant formats.    * Supports files with no atom count on the first line    * Supports the variant used in the Minnesota Solubility database, which has 3 header      lines.  * Add capability to store properties into the database for formats such as MOPAC and    SDF that can handle properties. Also can output the properties when writing the    files.  * Fixed bugs if the system name or configuration name is not a string, but rather a number.2022.10.28 -- Fixed bug reading cif and mmcif files  * There was a bug that caused a crash when reading cif and mmcif files, and potentially    some other formats. It has been fixed throughout.  * The standard error for properties were missing a commma in the property name. The    comma is standard elsewhere in SEAMM so add it here: '&lt;prop&gt;, stderr'2022.10.26 -- Handling OpenBabel error messages for MOPAC .mop files  Hiding messages about errors Kekulizing structures, which doesn't seem to be a serious  issue, and printing any other messages as warnings.2021.2.12 (12 February 2021)  * Updated the README file to give a better description.  * Updated the short description in setup.py to work with the new installer.  * Added keywords for better searchability.2021.2.4 (4 February 2021)  Updated for compatibility with the new system classes in MolSystem  2021.2.2 release.2020.12.5 (5 December 2020)  Internal: switching CI from TravisCI to GitHub Actions, and in the  process moving documentation from ReadTheDocs to GitHub Pages where  it is consolidated with the main SEAMM documentation.2020.8.1 (1 August 2020)  Removed leftover debug print statements.0.9 (15 April 2020)  * General bug fixing and code cleanup.  * Part of release of all modules.0.7.1 (23 November 2019)  First release on PyPI.</longdescription>
