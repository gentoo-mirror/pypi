External Pythonpackages (available in the [requirements](requirements) folder) havetheir own licenses, which can be consulted on their respective websites.------------------------------------------------------------------------## InstallationAlphaBase can be installed and used on all major operating systems(Windows, macOS and Linux). There are two different types ofinstallation possible:- [**Pip installer:**](#pip) Choose this installation if you want to use  AlphaBase as a Python package in an existing Python 3.8 environment  (e.g. a Jupyter notebook).- [**Developer installer:**](#developer) Choose this installation if you  are familiar with [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) and  Python. This installation allows access to all available features of  AlphaBase and even allows to modify its source code directly.  Generally, the developer version of AlphaBase outperforms the  precompiled versions which makes this the installation of choice for  high-throughput experiments.### PipAlphaBase can be installed in an existing Python 3.8 environment with asingle `bash` command. *This `bash` command can also be run directlyfrom within a Jupyter notebook by prepending it with a `!`*:``` bashpip install alphabase```Installing AlphaBase like this avoids conflicts when integrating it inother tools, as this does not enforce strict versioning of dependancies.However, if new versions of dependancies are released, they are notguaranteed to be fully compatible with AlphaBase. While this should onlyoccur in rare cases where dependencies are not backwards compatible, youcan always force AlphaBase to use dependancy versions which are known tobe compatible with:``` bashpip install &quot;alphabase[stable]&quot;```NOTE: You might need to run `pip install -U pip` before installingAlphaBase like this. Also note the double quotes `&quot;`.For those who are really adventurous, it is also possible to directlyinstall any branch (e.g. `@development`) with any extras(e.g. `#egg=alphabase[stable,development-stable]`) from GitHub with e.g.``` bashpip install &quot;git+https://github.com/MannLabs/alphabase.git@development#egg=alphabase[stable,development-stable]&quot;```### DeveloperAlphaBase can also be installed in editable (i.e. developer) mode with afew `bash` commands. This allows to fully customize the software andeven modify the source code to your specific needs. When an editablePython package is installed, its source code is stored in a transparentlocation of your choice. While optional, it is advised to first (createand) navigate to e.g. a general software folder:``` bashmkdir ~/folder/where/to/install/softwarecd ~/folder/where/to/install/software```***The following commands assume you do not perform any additional `cd`commands anymore***.Next, download the AlphaBase repository from GitHub either directly orwith a `git` command. This creates a new AlphaBase subfolder in yourcurrent directory.``` bashgit clone https://github.com/MannLabs/alphabase.git```For any Python package, it is highly recommended to use a separate[conda virtual environment](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), asotherwise *dependancy conflicts can occur with already existingpackages*.``` bashconda create --name alphabase python=3.9 -yconda activate alphabase```Finally, AlphaBase and all its [dependancies](requirements) need to beinstalled. To take advantage of all features and allow development (withthe `-e` flag), this is best done by also installing the [developmentdependencies](requirements/requirements_development.txt) instead of onlythe [core dependencies](requirements/requirements.txt):``` bashpip install -e &quot;./alphabase[development]&quot;```By default this installs loose dependancies (no explicit versioning),although it is also possible to use stable dependencies(e.g. `pip install -e &quot;./alphabase[stable,development-stable]&quot;`).***By using the editable flag `-e`, all modifications to the [AlphaBasesource code folder](alphabase) are directly reflected when runningAlphaBase. Note that the AlphaBase folder cannot be moved and/or renamedif an editable version is installed. In case of confusion, you canalways retrieve the location of any Python module with e.g. the command`import module` followed by `module.__file__`.***------------------------------------------------------------------------## UsageTODO------------------------------------------------------------------------## TroubleshootingIn case of issues, check out the following:- [Issues](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphabase/issues): Try a few  different search terms to find out if a similar problem has been  encountered before- [Discussions](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphabase/discussions):  Check if your problem or feature requests has been discussed before.------------------------------------------------------------------------## How to contributeIf you like this software, you can give us a[star](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphabase/stargazers) to boost ourvisibility!
