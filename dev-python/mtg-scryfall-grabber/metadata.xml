Clone the following repo```https://github.com/Contrastellar/mtg_scryfall_grabber```2. Navigate to the repo```shcd ./mtg_scryfall_grabber/```3. Install the environment, where `$NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT` is any name, or is omitted altogether, as one is given in the file.```shconda env create --file ./environment.yaml --name $NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT```4. Activate the environment```shconda activate $NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT```5. Navigate to the `./example/` directory```shcd ./example/```6. Run the following OS dependant command to download the information for the set &quot;Phyrexia, All Will Be One&quot;### PowerShell```bashpy msfg.py ONE -c -p```### Unix ```bashpython3 msfg.py ONE -c -p```## Quickstart w/o condaTo get started quickly, one must install Python 3 (version 3.8 or greater).Once having completed Python 3 installation for your Operating System, running the following command### PowerShell ---```bashpy -m pip install --upgrade mtg-scryfall-grabber```### MacOS/UNIX Terminal/bash ---```bashpython3 -m pip install --upgrade mtg-scryfall-grabber```This will install mtg-scryfall-grabber's `mtg_scryfall_grabber` library, to be imported and used in your own Python Module if so desired.From here, downloading (either from releases, or from [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository) the `example/msfg.py` file. Once this is done, the following steps can be taken to 'quickstart' downloading information from the Scryfall API.1. In your commandline (henceforth the CLI), navigate to the directory.```bashcd $MTG_SCRYFALL_GRABBER_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION/example/```2. Run the following command to download the information for the set &quot;Phyrexia, All Will Be One&quot;### PowerShell```bashpy msfg.py ONE -c -p```### MacOS/UNIX Terminal/Bash```bashpython3 msfg.py ONE -c -p```In `./example/`, this will create a directory named &quot;output&quot;, which will contain a `.json` file named like `ONE_name_price_$(TIME).json` -- where it is compiled by set code + unix time.## TODONothing else major needs to be done at this point, however polishing and code testing will be implemented to this library before this is considered a full, ready-to-be-used in production v.1 release.Additional functions need to be implimented, however -- an example implementation of this library is given in `./example/` under `msfg.py`. This implementation can also be treated as the &quot;primary&quot; method of using this library, in order to generate JSON to be used inside Excel spreadsheets or another spreadsheet program.## ContributingPull requests are welcome.
