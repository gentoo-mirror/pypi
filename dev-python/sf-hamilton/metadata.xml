It was originally built to simplify the creation of wide (1000+) column dataframes, but works on python objects of any type and dataflows of any complexity. Core to the design of Hamilton is a clear mapping of function name to components of the generated artifact, allowing you to quickly grok the relationship between the code you write and the data you produce. This paradigm makes modifications easy to build and track, ensures code is self-documenting, and makes it natural to unit test your data transformations. When connected together, these functions form a [Directed Acyclic Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAG), which the Hamilton framework can execute, optimize, and report on.# We forked and lost some starsThis repository is maintained by the original creators of Hamilton, who have since founded [DAGWorks inc.](https://dagworks.io/), a company largely dedicated to building and maintaining the Hamilton library. We decided to fork the original because Stitch Fix did not want to transfer ownership to us; we had grown the star count in the original repository to 893: &lt;img width=&quot;141&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2023-02-23 at 12 58 43 PM&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2328071/221029806-36a4e088-809b-4b08-9199-2fbf8049be34.png&quot;&gt;before forking.For the backstory on how Hamilton came about, see the original Stitch Fix [blog post!](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2021/10/14/functions-dags-hamilton/).# Feature comparisonHere are common things that Hamilton is compared to, and how Hamilton compares to them.| Feature                                   | Hamilton | Macro orchestration systems (e.g. Airflow) | Feast | dbt | Dask ||-------------------------------------------|:---:|:---------------------------------------------:|:-----:|:---:|:----:|| Python 3.7+                               | ✅  |                   ✅                          |   ✅  | ✅  |  ✅   || Helps you structure your code base        | ✅  |                   ❌                          |   ❌  | ✅  |  ❌   || Code is always unit testable              | ✅  |                   ❌                          |   ❌  | ❌  |  ❌   || Documentation friendly                    | ✅  |                   ❌                          |   ❌  | ❌  |  ❌   || Can visualize lineage easily              | ✅  |                   ❌                          |   ❌  | ✅  |  ✅   || Is just a library                         | ✅  |                   ❌                          |   ❌  | ❌  |  ✅   || Runs anywhere python runs                 | ✅  |                   ❌                          |   ❌  | ❌  |  ✅   || Built for managing python transformations | ✅  |                   ❌                          |   ❌  | ❌  |  ❌   || Can model GenerativeAI/LLM based workflows | ✅  |                   ❌                          |   ❌  | ❌  |  ❌   || Replaces macro orchestration systems      | ❌  |                   ✅                          |   ❌  | ❌  |  ❌   || Is a feature store                        | ❌  |                   ❌                          |   ✅  | ❌  |  ❌   |# Getting StartedIf you don't want to install anything to try Hamilton, we recommend trying [www.tryhamilton.dev](https://www.tryhamilton.dev/?utm_source=README).Otherwise, here's a quick getting started guide to get you up and running in less than 15 minutes.If you need help join our [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/hamilton-opensource/shared_invite/zt-1bjs72asx-wcUTgH7q7QX1igiQ5bbdcg) community to chat/ask Qs/etc.For the latest updates, follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/hamilton_os)!## InstallationRequirements:* Python 3.7+To get started, first you need to install hamilton. It is published to pypi under `sf-hamilton`:&gt; pip install sf-hamiltonNote: to use the DAG visualization functionality, you should instead do:&gt; pip install &quot;sf-hamilton[visualization]&quot;While it is installing we encourage you to start on the next section.Note: the content (i.e. names, function bodies) of our example code snippets are for illustrative purposes only, and don't reflect what we actually do internally.## Hamilton in &lt;15 minutesHamilton is a new paradigm when it comes to creating, um, dataframes (let's use dataframes as an example, otherwise you can create _ANY_ python object).Rather than thinking about manipulating a central dataframe, as is normal in some data engineering/data science work,you instead think about the column(s) you want to create, and what inputs are required. Thereis no need for you to think about maintaining this dataframe, meaning you do not need to think about any &quot;glue&quot; code;this is all taken care of by the Hamilton framework.For example rather than writing the following to manipulate a central dataframe object `df`:```pythondf['col_c'] = df['col_a'] + df['col_b']```you write```pythondef col_c(col_a: pd.Series, col_b: pd.Series) -&gt; pd.Series:    &quot;&quot;&quot;Creating column c from summing column a and column b.&quot;&quot;&quot;    return col_a + col_b```In diagram form:![example](hamiltondag.png)The Hamilton framework will then be able to build a DAG from this function definition.So let's create a &quot;Hello World&quot; and start using Hamilton!### Your first hello world.By now, you should have installed Hamilton, so let's write some code.1. Create a file `my_functions.py` and add the following functions:```pythonimport pandas as pddef avg_3wk_spend(spend: pd.Series) -&gt; pd.Series:    &quot;&quot;&quot;Rolling 3 week average spend.&quot;&quot;&quot;    return spend.rolling(3).mean()def spend_per_signup(spend: pd.Series, signups: pd.Series) -&gt; pd.Series:    &quot;&quot;&quot;The cost per signup in relation to spend.&quot;&quot;&quot;    return spend / signups```The astute observer will notice we have not defined `spend` or `signups` as functions. That is okay,this just means these need to be provided as input when we come to actually wanting to create a dataframe.Note: functions can take or create scalar values, in addition to any python object type.2. Create a `my_script.py` which is where code will live to tell Hamilton what to do:```pythonimport sysimport loggingimport importlibimport pandas as pdfrom hamilton import driverlogging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout)initial_columns = {  # load from actuals or wherever -- this is our initial data we use as input.    # Note: these do not have to be all series, they could be scalar inputs.    'signups': pd.Series([1, 10, 50, 100, 200, 400]),    'spend': pd.Series([10, 10, 20, 40, 40, 50]),}# we need to tell hamilton where to load function definitions frommodule_name = 'my_functions'module = importlib.import_module(module_name) # or we could just do `import my_functions`dr = driver.Driver(initial_columns, module)  # can pass in multiple modules# we need to specify what we want in the final dataframe.output_columns = [    'spend',  # or module.spend    'signups',  # or module.signups    'avg_3wk_spend',  # or module.avg_3wk_spend    'spend_per_signup',  # or module.spend_per_signup]# let's create the dataframe!# if you only did `pip install sf-hamilton` earlier:df = dr.execute(output_columns)# else if you did `pip install &quot;sf-hamilton[visualization]&quot;` earlier:# dr.visualize_execution(output_columns, './my-dag.dot', {})print(df)```3. Run my_script.py&gt; python my_script.pyYou should see the following output:       spend  signups  avg_3wk_spend  spend_per_signup    0     10        1            NaN            10.000    1     10       10            NaN             1.000    2     20       50      13.333333             0.400    3     40      100      23.333333             0.400    4     40      200      33.333333             0.200    5     50      400      43.333333             0.125You should see the following image if you ran `dr.visualize_execution(output_columns, './my-dag.dot', {})`:![hello_world_image](hello_world_image.png)Congratulations - you just created your Hamilton dataflow that created a dataframe!## Example Hamilton DataflowsWe have a growing list of examples showcasing how one might use Hamilton.

Ensure you understand [Hamilton Basics](https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/hamilton/blob/main/basics.md).2. Familiarize yourself with some of the [Hamilton decorators](https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/hamilton/blob/main/decorators.md). They will help keep your code DRY.3. Start creating Hamilton Functions that represent your work. We suggest grouping them in modules where it makes sense.4. Write a simple script so that you can easily run things end to end.5. Join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/hamilton-opensource/shared_invite/zt-1bjs72asx-wcUTgH7q7QX1igiQ5bbdcg) community to chat/ask Qs/etc.For the backstory on Hamilton we invite you to watch a roughly-9 minute lightning talk on it that we gave at the apply conference:[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5Zp_30Knoo), [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/StefanKrawczyk/hamilton-a-micro-framework-for-creating-dataframes).## PyCharm TipsIf you're using Hamilton, it's likely that you'll need to migrate some code. Here are some useful tricks we foundto speed up that process.### Live templatesLive templates are a cool feature and allow you to type in a name which expands into some code.E.g. For example, we wrote one to make it quick to stub out Hamilton functions: typing `graphfunc` would turn into -&gt;```pythondef _(_: pd.Series) -&gt; pd.Series:   &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;   return _```Where the blanks are where you can tab with the cursor and fill things in. See your pycharm preferences for setting this up.### Multiple CursorsIf you are doing a lot of repetitive work, one might consider multiple cursors. Multiple cursors allow you to do things on multiple lines at once.To use it hit `option + mouse click` to create multiple cursors. `Esc` to revert back to a normal mode.# Usage analytics &amp; data privacyBy default, when using Hamilton, it collects anonymous usage data to help improve Hamilton and know where to apply developmentefforts.We capture three types of events: one when the `Driver` object is instantiated, one when the `execute()` call on the `Driver` object completes, and one for most `Driver` object function invocations.No user data or potentially sensitive information is or ever will be collected. The captured data is limited to:* Operating System and Python version* A persistent UUID to indentify the session, stored in ~/.hamilton.conf.* Error stack trace limited to Hamilton code, if one occurs.* Information on what features you're using from Hamilton: decorators, adapters, result builders.* How Hamilton is being used: number of final nodes in DAG, number of modules, size of objects passed to `execute()`, the name of the Driver function being invoked.If you're worried, see telemetry.py for details.If you do not wish to participate, one can opt-out with one of the following methods:1. Set it to false programmatically in your code before creating a Hamilton driver:   ```python   from hamilton import telemetry   telemetry.disable_telemetry()   ```2. Set the key `telemetry_enabled` to `false` in ~/.hamilton.conf under the `DEFAULT` section:   ```   [DEFAULT]   telemetry_enabled = False   ```3. Set HAMILTON_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false as an environment variable. Either setting it for your shell session:   ```bash   export HAMILTON_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false   ```   or passing it as part of the run command:   ```bash   HAMILTON_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false python NAME_OF_MY_DRIVER.py   ```# Contributors## Code Contributors- Stefan Krawczyk (@skrawcz)- Elijah ben Izzy (@elijahbenizzy)- Danielle Quinn (@danfisher-sf)- Rachel Insoft (@rinsoft-sf)- Shelly Jang (@shellyjang)- Vincent Chu (@vslchusf)- Christopher Prohm (@chmp)- James Lamb (@jameslamb)- Avnish Pal (@bovem)- Sarah Haskins (@frenchfrywpepper)- Thierry Jean (@zilto)- Michał Siedlaczek (@elshize)## Bug Hunters/Special Mentions- Nils Olsson (@nilsso)- Michał Siedlaczek (@elshize)- Alaa Abedrabbo (@AAbedrabbo)- Shreya Datar (@datarshreya)- Baldo Faieta (@baldofaieta)- Anwar Brini (@AnwarBrini)- Gourav Kumar (@gms101)- Amos Aikman (@amosaikman)- Ankush Kundaliya (@akundaliya)- David Weselowski (@j7zAhU)- Peter Robinson (@Peter4137)- Seth Stokes (@sT0v- Louis Maddox (@lmmx)- Stephen Bias (@s-ducks)- Anup Joseph (@AnupJoseph)- Jan Hurst (@janhurst)</longdescription>
