More information canbe found here in the[documentation website](https://ledgerhq.github.io/speculos) (or in the[docs/ folder](docs/) directly).Usage example:```shell./speculos.py apps/btc.elf --model nanos# ... and open a browser on http://127.0.0.1:5000```## Bugs and contributionsFeel free to open issues and create pull requests on this GitHub repository.The `master` branch is protected to disable force pushing. Contributions shouldbe made through pull requests, which are reviewed by @LedgerHQ members beforebeing merged to `master`:- @LedgerHQ members can create branches directly on the repository (if member of  a team with write access to the repository)- External contributors should fork the repository## LimitationsThere is absolutely no guarantee that apps will have the same behavior onhardware devices and Speculos, though the differences are limited.### SyscallsThe emulator handles only a few syscalls made by common apps. For instance,syscalls related to app install, firmware update or OS info can't beimplemented.Invalid syscall parameters might throw an exception on a real device whilebeing ignored on Speculos.Notably, this is the case for application allowed derivation path and curve andapplication settings flags which are enforced by the device OS, but ignored bySpeculos.### Memory alignmentAttempts to perform unaligned accesses when not allowed (eg. dereferencing amisaligned pointer) will cause an alignment fault on a Ledger Nano S device butnot on Speculos. Note that such unaligned accesses are supported by otherLedger devices.Following code crashes on LNS device, but not on Speculos nor on other devices.```uint8_t buffer[20];for (int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++) {    buffer[i] = i;}uint32_t display_value = *((uint32_t*) (buffer + 1));PRINTF(&quot;display_value: %d\n&quot;, display_value);```### WatchdogNanoX and Stax devices use an internal watchdog enforcing usage of regularcalls to `io_seproxyhal_io_heartbeat();`. This watchdog is not emulated onSpeculos.### Pending review screenThe C SDK offers a feature to display a warning screen upon app launchindicating that the app has not been reviewed.As the `_install_parameters` are not handled by Speculos, the screen won't be displayed.## SecurityApps can make arbitrary Linux system calls (and use QEMU[semihosting](docs/user/semihosting.md) features), thus don't run Speculos onuntrusted apps.It's worth noting that the syscall implementation (`src/`) doesn't expectmalicious input. By the way, in Speculos, there is no privilege separationbetween the app and the syscalls. This doesn't reflect the security of thefirmware on hardware devices where app and OS isolation is enforced.Speculos is not part of Ledger bug bounty program.## Are you developing a Nano App as an external developer?For a smooth and quick integration:- Follow the developers documentation on the [Developer Portal](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/nano-app/introduction/) and - [Go on Discord](https://developers.ledger.com/discord-pro/) to chat with developer support and the developer community.</longdescription>
