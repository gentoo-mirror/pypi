	<longdescription># OverviewHotsos is a framework for software-defined analysis. It provides a library ofplugins written in Python along with a [high-levellanguage](hotsos/defs/README.md) in which to implement checks and analysis andreport problems. Supported plugins include:* Openstack* Kubernetes* Ceph* Open vSwitch* Juju* MAAS* Vault* MySQL* RabbitMQ* and moreEach plugin has associated checks or &quot;scenarios&quot; that seek to identify issuesand known bugs. The output is a summary from each plugin including key runtimeinformation as well issues or bugs detected along with suggestions on how todeal with them. This information can be useful as an aid for further manualanalysis.The default summary format is yaml and a number of other options and formats areprovided.Hotsos is run directly on a host or against a [sosreport](https://github.com/sosreport/sos).The code has the following structure:* core python library (includes plugins)* checks/scenarios (see documentation at [defs](hotsos/defs/README.md))* python plugin extensions* tests## UsageSay for example that you are running an Openstack Cloud and one of yourhypervisor nodes that is also running part of a Ceph storage clusteris experiencing a problem with network connectivity to workloads. Simplyrun hotsos on the node or against a sosreport generated from that node e.g.```consoleubuntu@ncpu1$ hotsos -sINFO: analysing localhost /INFO: output saved to hotsos-output-1673868979```Now you will find a folder called `hotsos-output-1673868979` containing asummary of information in a number of different formats. Taking the most commonyaml format we can see:```consoleubuntu@ncpu1$ cat hotsos-output-1673868979/ncpu1.summary.yaml```This file will contain a per-plugin summary of information found along with anyissues or bugs detected. By default hotsos will only look at the last 24 hours of logs.You can increase this with `--all-logs` which will by default give you 7 daysworth and if you want more you can use `--max-logrotate-depth &lt;days&gt;`.Our folder also contains other formats of the same information and one of thoseis json which can easily be queried using a tool called[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). Using this useful tool we can easily queryfor specific information e.g.```consoleubuntu@ncpu1$ jq -r '.storage.&quot;potential-issues&quot;' hotsos-output-1673868979/ncpu1.summary.json{  &quot;BcacheWarnings&quot;: [    &quot;One or more of the following bcache bdev config assertions failed: sequential_cutoff eq \&quot;0.0k\&quot;/actual=\&quot;4.0M\&quot;, cache_mode eq \&quot;writethrough [writeback] writearound none\&quot;/actual=\&quot;writethrough [writeback] writearound none\&quot;, writeback_percent ge 10/actual=\&quot;10\&quot; (origin=storage.auto_scenario_check)&quot;,    &quot;One or more of the following bcache cacheset config assertions failed: congested_read_threshold_us eq 0/actual=\&quot;2000\&quot;, congested_write_threshold_us eq 0/actual=\&quot;20000\&quot; (origin=storage.auto_scenario_check)&quot;  ]}```## ExamplesAn example **full** (yaml) summary can be found[here](examples/hotsos-example-openstack.summary.yaml)An example **short** (yaml) summary can be found[here](examples/hotsos-example-openstack.short.summary.yaml)## InstallHotSOS can be installed in the following ways:### Daily build Debian packageNOTE: this is the recommended method.```console$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-support-team/hotsos$ sudo apt install hotsos```### pypiNOTE: requires Python &gt;= 3.8```console$ sudo apt install python3-pip$ pip install hotsos```NOTE: when upgrading be sure to upgrade dependencies since pip will not do this by default.      To forcibly upgrade all dependencies you can use:```pip install --upgrade hotsos --upgrade-strategy eager```### snapYou can install as a snap e.g.```console$ sudo apt install snapd$ sudo snap install hotsos --classic```See &lt;https://snapcraft.io/hotsos&gt; for more info on usage.NOTE: the snap only currently works properly on Ubuntu Focal.### source```console$ git clone https://github.com/canonical/hotsos$ pip install -r hotsos/requirements.txt$ ./hotsos/scripts/hotsos```</longdescription>
