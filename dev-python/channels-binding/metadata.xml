	<longdescription>Channels Binding API--------------------Channels Binding exposes an JSON API streaming system over `channels &lt;https://github.com/django/channels&gt;`_,It's designed to work as a full featured RestAPI via websocket, http, or both protocols combined.in very few code lines, with a very simple and verboseless exchange structure, where each django Models would be easily binded and come with native basics operations like 'retrieve', 'search', 'update', 'create', 'delete' and subscription.We could made the comparaison with django restframework with the REST system.It also provides react packages with ready-to-use pre configured tools and components to make easy Applications UIs.Channels-binding is a compilation of somes packages :- https://pypi.org/project/channels-binding/ for python/django- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@channels-binding/core for node/react- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@channels-binding/mui for material-ui integrationSummary-------- `Demo (soon)`- `Capabilities &lt;#capabilities&gt;`__- `Exchanges Structure Overviews &lt;#exchanges-structure-overviews&gt;`__- `Gettings Started &lt;#getting-started&gt;`__- `Custom Events Binding &lt;#custom-events-binding&gt;`__Capabilities------------- Support of 'retrieve', 'form', 'search', 'list''update', 'create', 'save', 'delete', 'subscribe' events- Support of django signals to refresh any connected instance with React tools- Support of native django Queryset into React (Material-UI Tables available)- Support of native django Form into React (Material-UI Fields available)- Support of Hashed events for targeted subscribers (example: 2 lists on the same stream/event/model but with different filtering)- Auto channels subscribing groups of interest 'retrieve', 'list', 'delete'- Custom bindings events through decorators- Compatible with Django restframework serializers (soon ready)- Both Async or Sync Consumers (not yet)- Both HTTP Rest or WS API  (not yet)Exchanges Structure Overviews-----------------------------.. code:: javascript    SELF SEND =&gt;
