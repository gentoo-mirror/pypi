	<longdescription># pyapproxmc: bindings to the ApproxMC model counterThis directory provides Python bindings to ApproxMC on the C++ level,i.e. when importing pyapproxmc, the ApproxMC counter becomes part of thePython process itself.## Installing```pip install pyapproxmc```## CompilingIf you don't want to use the pip package, you can compile it:```apt-get install python-devcd pythongit clone https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisatgit clone https://github.com/meelgroup/arjuncd ..python -m buildYou will then find the files under &quot;dist/&quot;.```## Usage```import pyapproxmcc = pyapproxmc.Counter()c.add_clause([1,2,3])c.add_clause([3,20])count = c.count()print(&quot;Approximate count is: %d*2**%d&quot; % (count[0], count[1]))```The above will print that `Approximate count is: 88*2**13`. Since the largest variable in the clauses was 20, the system contained 2**20 (i.e. 1048576) potential models. However, some of these models were prohibited by the two clauses, and so only approximately 88*2**13 (i.e. 720896) models remained.If you want to count over a projection set, you need to call `count(projection_set)`, for example:```import pyapproxmcc = pyapproxmc.Counter()c.add_clause([1,2,3])c.add_clause([3,20])count = c.count(range(1,10))print(&quot;Approximate count is: %d*2**%d&quot; % (count[0], count[1]))```This now prints `Approximate count is: 56*2**3`, which corresponds to the approximate count of models, projected over variables 1..10.## Counter ObjectYou can give the following arguments to `Counter`:* `seed` -- sets the random seed* `verbosity` -- sets the verbosity of the system (default = 0)* `epsilon` -- Tolerance parameter, i.e. sets how approximate the returned count is. Default = 0.8* `delta` -- Confidence parameter, i.e. sets how probabilistically correct the returned count is. Default = 0.20</longdescription>
