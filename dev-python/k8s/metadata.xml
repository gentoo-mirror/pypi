The library tries to provide an intuitive developer experience, rather than modelling the REST API directly. Our approach does not allow us to use Swagger to auto-generate a library that covers the entire API, but the parts we have implemented are (in our opinion) easier to work with than the client you get when using Swagger.Check out the tutorial_ to find out how to use the library, or the `developer guide`_ to learn how to extend the library to cover parts of the API we haven't gotten around to yet... _tutorial: http://k8s.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html.. _developer guide: http://k8s.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer.htmlChanges since last version--------------------------* `95ae77e`_: Avoid redefining builtins* `4052f6d`_: Disable no-self-use pylint warning for test classes* `1cc941a`_: discard watch event if Model instance can't be created* `c358388`_: Verify current behavior for events in watch_list* `b48b49f`_: Disable no-self-use linting for test class* `3d00f69`_: Make stringData field of secret work* `244bc5d`_: Update helpers to support newer versions of python.. _95ae77e: https://github.com/fiaas/k8s/commit/95ae77e.. _1cc941a: https://github.com/fiaas/k8s/commit/1cc941a.. _4052f6d: https://github.com/fiaas/k8s/commit/4052f6d.. _b48b49f: https://github.com/fiaas/k8s/commit/b48b49f.. _3d00f69: https://github.com/fiaas/k8s/commit/3d00f69.. _244bc5d: https://github.com/fiaas/k8s/commit/244bc5d.. _c358388: https://github.com/fiaas/k8s/commit/c358388</longdescription>
