	<longdescription>![Demo Gif](docs/assets/demo.gif)transient---------[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/transient/badge/?version=latest)](https://transient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)`transient` is a wrapper around QEMU that provides additional features like downloadingand building disk images, shared folders, and SSH support.Motivation----------The primary motivation for the development of `transient` is to have a simple way tocreate short-lived virtual machines for testing and development, particularly kerneland hypervisor development. There are many other tools for creating virtual machines,such as [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) or the many [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/)based solutions. However, these are almost always very stateful. It can be difficultto create virtual machines using these tools in CI environments, as the state maynot always be appropriately synchronized. Also, these tools can make it more difficultto supply an existing kernel/initramfs when booting the virtual machine.Almost all linux-based virtualization tools ultimately rely on `qemu`. `transient` makesthis dependency transparent, allowing the user the entire flexibility of QEMU. This canbe very helpful, for example, when attempting to setup complex virtual networkingsituations which may be difficult to express in the abstractions provided by other tools.Installation------------`transient` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/transient/), so the latestrelease can be installed with `pip install transient`. It is also available from[GNU Guix](http://guix.gnu.org/), and can be installed with`guix install python-transient`. To install `transient` from source, clone thisrepository and run `pip install -e '.[dev]'` from the project root. As always,the usage of python [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)is recommended for a development setup. The development environment can alsobe built by running `make dev` from the project root.`transient` has very few dependencies. On Ubuntu, these can be installed by running`apt-get install ssh qemu-system-x86 python3-pip`.Documentation-------------Documentation for `transient` is available on [Read the Docs](https://transient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).Quick Start-----------`transient` is primarily a wrapper for QEMU. It supplies a small set of flags thatare used to add additional features to the VM being started. As the name implies,it is almost completely stateless. This avoids problems that can sometimes occurwith `libvirt` based tools becoming 'unsynchronized' with the real system state.For example, in the following command, the flags before the `--` are passed to`transient`. The remaining arguments are passed directly to QEMU. This examplewill cause `transient` to download and run a Centos7 VM (from the Vagrant Cloud)with 1GB of memory using a text console. This virtual machine will be automaticallyshut down on exit and its disk will be destroyed.```transient run centos/7:2004.01 -- -nographic -enable-kvm -m 1G````transient` also supports a `vagrant` style SSH connection. This will start thevirtual machine and connect standard input and output to an SSH connectionwith the machine, instead of the serial console. However, when this connectionis closed, the machine will be automatically shut down (unlike `vagrant`). Forexample:```transient run centos/7:2004.01 --ssh-console -- -enable-kvm -m 1G```The `--ssh-console` flag depends on the image having the normal vagrant keypairtrusted for the `vagrant` user.Building Images---------------One side-effect of the development of `transient` was to create a Dockefile-likedeclarative file that can be used to build virtual machine disk images. For example,the file below would build a Centos 7 image based on the existing `vagrant` image`centos/7:2004.01` but with `nano` installed and a hostname change:```FROM centos/7:2004.01RUN yum install -y nanoRUN echo 'myhostname' &gt; /etc/hostname```For additional information on building images, see the[Building Images page](https://transient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/image/#building-images)of the docs.License-------This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.
