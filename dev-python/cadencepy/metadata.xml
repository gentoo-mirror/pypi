	<longdescription># PyCadence A Python wrapper for running Cadence simulations## Installation1. Ocean Spectre and Python to be installed on the same device2. Install PyCadence using pip```pip install cadencepy```## Usage1. Make sure to have a template init.ocn file ready2. In the ocn file placeholder values must be marked as {{value}} as shown in the sample init.ocn file placed in the sample folder3. Create a screen with name ocean_simulation using the following shell command. The screen should be in the directory of the init.ocn file```shellscreen -S ocean_simulation```4. Install and enable ocean terminal using the following shell commands```shellocean```5. Then detach the screen using ctrl+a+d6. Run the following python code to run the simulation```pythonfrom pycadence.pycadence import Connectorx = [1,2,3,4,5] # List of values to be substituted in the templatedefault = [1,2,3,4,5] # List of default values to be substituted in the template in case of errorp=Connector(screen_name=&quot;ocean_simulation&quot;)p.simulate(x, default,&quot;init.ocn&quot;,&quot;output.ocn&quot;,&quot;output.txt&quot;)```7. The result of simulation will be stored output.txt file and the output.ocn file will be the modified template file with the values substituted.8. The simulate function also has an argument called read_output which takes a function as an argument. This function will be called after the simulation is complete and the output.txt file is generated. The function should take the output.txt file as an argument and return a dictionary of the values to be substituted in the template file. The following code shows an example of how to use this argument.```pythonfrom pycadence.pycadence import Connectorimport numpy as npdef read_output(output_log_path):    with open(output_log_path, 'r+') as fp:        # read an store all lines into list        lines = fp.readlines()        data=[]        for line in lines[2:]:            try:                temp = line.strip().split(&quot; &quot;)                # print(temp)                data.append([float(temp[0]),float(temp[-1])])            except Exception as e:                # print(&quot;Error in reading output file&quot;)                # print(e)                pass        data = np.array(data)    return datap=Connector(screen_name=&quot;ocean_simulation&quot;)x = [1,2,3,4,5] # List of values to be substituted in the templatedefault = [1,2,3,4,5] # List of default values to be substituted in the template in case of errorp.simulate(x, default,&quot;init.ocn&quot;,&quot;output.ocn&quot;,&quot;output.txt&quot;,read_output)```9. The above code will read the output.txt file and return a numpy array of the values to be substituted in the template file. The first column of the array will be substituted in the first placeholder and so on. The above code will work for any number of placeholders in the template file.</longdescription>
