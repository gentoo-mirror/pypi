	<longdescription>============sxl Overview============This library is intended to help you deal with big Excel files from withinPython. After trying pandas_, openpyxl_, xlwings_, and even win32com_ it seemsthat none have the ability to iterate over large Excel files without loadingthem completely into memory. So when you are dealing with files that areextremely large, this can be burdensome (especially if you only want to examinea bit of the file - the first 10 rows say). This library solves that by parsingthe SpreadsheetML / XML xlsx files using a streaming parser. So you can see thefirst ten rows of any tab within any Excel file extremely quickly.Getting Started===============There are no dependancies to install. You just need to::    pip install sxlOnce installed, you can iterate through the entire file without using muchmemory by doing the following::    from sxl import Workbook    wb = Workbook(&quot;filepath&quot;)    ws = wb.sheets['sheet name'] # or, for example, wb.sheets[1]    for row in ws.rows:        print(row)Note that by default we assume the workbook is encoded with UTF-8. If you needto specifiy a different encoding, you can do so when opening the workbook::    wb = Workbook(&quot;filepath&quot;, encoding='cp1252')If you are only interested in a few rows::    head = ws.head(5)    print(head)Running Tests=============To run tests::    python -m tests.test_sxlLicense=======The project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md_ file fordetails.. _openpyxl: https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/.. _xlwings: http://docs.xlwings.org/en/stable/quickstart.html.. _win32com: http://docs.activestate.com/activepython/2.4/pywin32/html/com/win32com/HTML/docindex.html.. _pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/.. _license.md: /LICENSE.txt.. _lax: http://www.dictionary.com/browse/lax?s=t</longdescription>
