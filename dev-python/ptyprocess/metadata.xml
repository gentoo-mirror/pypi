	<longdescription>Launch a subprocess in a pseudo terminal (pty), and interact with both theprocess and its pty.Sometimes, piping stdin and stdout is not enough. There might be a passwordprompt that doesn't read from stdin, output that changes when it's going to apipe rather than a terminal, or curses-style interfaces that rely on a terminal.If you need to automate these things, running the process in a pseudo terminal(pty) is the answer.Interface::    p = PtyProcessUnicode.spawn(['python'])    p.read(20)    p.write('6+6\n')    p.read(20)</longdescription>
