	<longdescription>bigdict=======``bigdict`` implements a persisted, out-of-memory dict for Python.The usage API strives to be as close as possible to the built-in ``dict``, with a small number of extras.The &quot;engine&quot;, or &quot;back-end&quot;, is currently ``lmdb``. However, ``lmdb`` is not the point; the point is rather a &quot;persisted, out-of-memory dict&quot;. Criteria used in choosing the engine:- It must be *embedded*, as opposed to client/server.- It must be a mature project with a reliable Python binding.In addition,- It must use more files for storage as the data size grows, hence keeping file sizes modest,  as opposed to a single file growing in size.If the chosen backend does not meet this requirement, it's the responsibility of ``bigdict`` to implement that.Installation::    $ pip install bigdict</longdescription>
