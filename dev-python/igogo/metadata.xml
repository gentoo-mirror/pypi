	<longdescription># igogo üêéüèéÔ∏èExecute several jupyter cells at the same time&gt; Have you ever just sited and watched a long-running jupyter cell?&gt; **Now, you can continue to work in the same notebook freely**https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25539425/227176976-2bdda463-ecc9-4431-afec-6d31fbd4c214.mov---## Use Cases1) **You have a long-running cell, and you need to check something.   You can just start the second cell without interrupting a long-running cell**.   &gt; **Example:** you run a machine learning train loop and want to immediately save the model's weights or check metrics.   &gt; With `igogo` you can do so without interrupting the training.2) **If you need to compare the score of some function with different parameters, you can run several   functions at the same time and monitor results**.    &gt; **Example:** you have several sets of hyperparameters and want to compare them.   &gt; You can start training two models, monitoring two loss graphs at the same time. 3) **Process data in chunks**. Check processed data for validity   &gt; **Example:** you do data processing in steps. With `igogo` you can execute several steps at the same time   &gt; and process data from the first processing step in the second processing step in chunks.   &gt; Also, you can quickly check that the first step produces the correct results## InstallIgogo is available through PyPi:```bashpip install igogo```## Wait, isn't it just a background job? No.- **No multithreading, no data races, no locks**.You can freely operate with your notebook variables without the risk of corrupting them.- **Beautiful output**. When several cells execute in parallel,all printed data is displayed in the corresponding cell's output. No more twisted and messed out concurrent outputs.- **Easily cancel jobs, wait for completion, and start the new ones**.- **Control execution of jobs through widgets**.## UsageAt the core of igogo is collaborative execution. Jobs need to explicitly allow other jobs to execute through `igogo.yielder()`. Mind that regular cells also represent a job.Placing `igogo.yielder()` in code that is not executed in igogo job is not a mistake. It will return immediately. So, you don't need to care about keeping `igogo.yielder()` only in igogo jobs. You can place it anywhereTo start an igogo job, you can use `%%igogo` cell magic or function decorator. ```pythonimport igogo@igogo.jobdef hello_world(name):    for i in range(3):        print(&quot;Hello, world from&quot;, name)                # allows other jobs to run while asleep        # also can be `igogo.yielder()`        igogo.sleep(1)      return name```Call function as usual to start a job:```pythonhello_world('igogo'), hello_world('other igogo');```https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25539425/227186815-6870e348-46e6-4086-a89b-be416c0cc1a7.mov### Configure JobsDecorator `@igogo.job` has several useful parameters. - `kind`\   Allows to set how to render output. Possible options: `text`, `markdown`, `html` Default: `text`- `displays`\   As igogo job modify already executed cell, it needs to have spare placeholders for rich output.   This parameter specifies how many spare displays to spawn. Default: `1`- `name`\   User-friendly name of igogo job.- `warn_rewrite`\   Should warn rewriting older displays? Default: `True`- `auto_display_figures`\   Should display pyplot figures created inside igogo automatically? Default: `True`Markdown example:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25539425/227203729-af94582c-8fe2-40fe-a6f0-6489a374a88f.mov### Display Additional DataPyplot figures will be automatically displayed in igogo cell.You can also use `igogo.display` inside a job to display any other content or several figures. Mind that displays must be pre-allocated by specifying displays number in `igogo.job(displays=...)````pythonimport numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport igogodef experiment(name, f, i):     x = np.linspace(0, i / 10, 100)     fig = plt.figure()     plt.plot(         x,         f(x)     )     plt.gca().set_title(name)     igogo.display(fig)          fig = plt.figure()     plt.scatter(         x,         f(x)     )     plt.gca().set_title(name)     igogo.display(fig)     igogo.sleep(0.05)```As noted in &quot;Configure jobs&quot; section, `igogo` jobs have limited number of displays.If you try to display more objects than job has, warning will be shown and the oldest displays will be overwritten.### Cell MagicThe same way with `%%igogo`:```python%load_ext igogo``````python%%igogoname = 'igogo'for i in range(3):     print(&quot;Hello, world from&quot;, name)     igogo.sleep(1)```### WidgetsAll executed `igogo` jobs spawn a widget that allows to kill them. Jobs are not affected by `KeyboardInterrupt`### Killing JobsApart from killing through widgets, `igogo` jobs can be killed programmatically.- `igogo.stop()` \   Can be called inside `igogo` job to kill itself.- `igogo.stop_all()`\   Stops all running `igogo` jobs- `igogo.stop_latest()`\   Stops the latest `igogo` job. Can be executed several times.- `igogo.stop_by_cell_id(cell_id)`\   Kills all jobs that were launched in cell with `cell_id` (aka [5], cell_id=5).Also, you can stop jobs of one specific function.- `hello_world.stop_all()`\   Stops all `igogo` jobs created by `hello_world()`## Supported ClientsCurrently, `igogo` runs fully correct on:- Jupyter Lab- JupyterRuns but has problems with output from igogo jobs. Jobs are executed, but there could be problems with widgets and output:- VSCode. For some reason it does not update display data. Therefore, no output is produced.- DataSpell. It displays `[object Object]` and not output.- Colab. It does not support updating content of executed cells## More Examples[**Check out pretty notebooks**](https://github.com/alexdremov/igogo/tree/main/examples)---### Train model and check metrics https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25539425/227651626-cba8a317-a986-4971-9639-84cdb388e2d3.movAlso, you can modify training parameters, freeze/unfreeze layers, switch datasets, etc. All you need is to place `igogo.yielder()` in train loop.### Process data and montitor execution```pythonimport igogoimport numpy as npfrom tqdm.auto import tqdm%load_ext igogoraw_data = np.random.randn(100000, 100)result = []``````pythondef row_processor(row):    return np.mean(row)``````python%%igogofor i in tqdm(range(len(raw_data))):    result.append(row_processor(raw_data[i]))    igogo.yielder()``````pythonresult[-1]```### Process data in chunks```pythonimport igogoimport numpy as npfrom tqdm.auto import tqdm%load_ext igogoraw_data = np.random.randn(5000000, 100)igogo_yield_freq = 32igogo_first_step_cache = []result = []``````python%%igogofor i in tqdm(range(len(raw_data))):    processed = np.log(raw_data[i] * raw_data[i])    igogo_first_step_cache.append(processed)        if i &gt; 0 and i % igogo_yield_freq == 0:        igogo.yielder()  # allow other jobs to execute``````python%%igogofor i in tqdm(range(len(raw_data))):    while i &gt;= len(igogo_first_step_cache):  # wait for producer to process data        igogo.yielder()        result.append(np.mean(igogo_first_step_cache[i]))    ```https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25539425/227224077-a3ce664c-cb52-4aa2-a3fe-71ac5a03cdeb.mov</longdescription>
