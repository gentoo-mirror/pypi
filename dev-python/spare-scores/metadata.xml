This would be an example of a classification-based SPARE model (currently powered by support vector machine or SVM). This model (that we named SPARE-AD) then computes SPARE-AD scores on an individual-basis that indicates how much the individual carries the learned brain patterns of AD.Alternatively, you may want to find the spatial pattern related to brain aging (BA). In this case, you would provide sample images and indicate that chronological age is what you expect the model to learn patterns for. This would be an example of a regression-based SPARE model (also powered by SVM). This model (that we named SPARE-BA) then computes SPARE-BA scores on an individual-basis that predicts your brain age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;## References- SPARE-AD  Davatzikos, C., Xu, F., An, Y., Fan, Y. &amp; Resnick, S.
