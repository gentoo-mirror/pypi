This utility is a pluggable tool which is handling system users, local users and groups;external packages are available to provide other authentication and security mechanisms, likeHTTP authentication, JWT tokens management, and OAuth, Azure or LDAP based authentication.Finally, PyAMS_security provides ACLs and roles management, as well as custom schema fields tostore roles assigned to principals.Changelog=========2.0.1----- - updated Buildout configuration2.0.0----- - migrated to Pyramid 2.0 - added interface and adapter to get user roles - added REST API authentication checker1.11.2------ - renamed settings parameter used to disable default security policy on site root1.11.1------ - updated doctests - added support for Python 3.111.11.0------ - added support for user registration - moved open registration settings to PyAMS_security_views package1.10.6------ - updated CORS requests handler - use f-strings in logger output1.10.5------ - added constant to set unchanged password value1.10.4------ - added allowed methods argument to CORS requests handler - rollback on Gitlab-CI test coverage report integration1.10.3------ - added Gitlab-CI test coverage report1.10.2------ - added custom CORS requests handler adapter1.10.1------ - updated Gitlab-CI configuration1.10.0------ - added REST services configuration and validators to handle CORS requests1.9.0----- - moved security plugins interfaces to dedicated module - added support for Python 3.101.8.4----- - added method to security manager to get a raw principal, bypassing cache1.8.3----- - updated translations1.8.2----- - reStructuredText formatting error...1.8.1----- - added constant for unknown principal ID - added constants for principal and group ID formatters1.8.0----- - added attribute to security manager to show link in home page1.7.1----- - added strings constants for plug-ins labels1.7.0----- - added ProtectedViewObjectMixin, to be used as base for any object using dynamic   *permission* property - added &quot;action&quot; argument to &quot;get_edit_permission()&quot; function; this allows to register   custom adapters to *IViewContextPermissionChecker* with this name, to be able to check   edit permissions for custom actions - added ISecurityContext interface1.6.2----- - renamed 'skin' module to 'api'1.6.1----- - correction in Gitlab-CI Pylint task1.6.0----- - removed support for Python &lt; 3.7 - added custom password encoders - updated doctests1.5.5----- - updated Gitlab-CI configuration1.5.4----- - updated Gitlab-CI configuration1.5.3----- - added wheels to Buildout configuration1.5.2----- - updated Gitlab-CI configuration for last Python versions1.5.1----- - updated doctests1.5.0----- - added ISecurityManager factory configuration - removed Travis-CI configuration1.4.0----- - added config.upgrade_role function, to be able to add permissions to an existing role - updated default site roles - updated doctests1.3.1----- - updated security manager interface to add registered credentials plug-ins names1.3.0----- - added argument in &quot;find_principals&quot; methods to only allow exact match1.2.1----- - use updated WSGI decorator to prevent storage of null values into request environment1.2.0----- - updated roles management; this will allow to extend supported roles of a given class just   by adding adapters, without modifying the original class - moved PyAMS security policy to dedicated module - added registration of standard roles and security policy - add factories registration in default security plug-ins - updated users registration process - updated adapter_config decorator arguments - updated doctests1.1.3----- - small updates in policy management of *authenticated_user_id*1.1.2----- - updated doctests with configured cache1.1.1----- - removed dependency on *pyams_auth_http* package1.1.0----- - moved authentication plug-ins to dedicated packages (see pyams_auth_http, pyams_auth_jwt...) - moved PyAMS authentication policy to dedicated module - handle ConnectionStateError in authentication policy - updated doctests1.0.5----- - simple version switch to avoid mismatch in Buildout configuration file...  :(1.0.4----- - code cleanup1.0.3----- - handle ConnectionStateError in JWT authentication plug-in - updated doctests1.0.2----- - added support for HS512 and RS512 JWT encryption protocols1.0.1----- - updated imports in include file for tests integration1.0.0----- - initial release</longdescription>
