The Forest Admininterface is a web application that handles communication between the adminuser and your application data through the Admin API.## Features### CRUDAll of your CRUD operations are natively supported. The API automaticallysupports your data models' validation and allows you to easily extend oroverride any API routes' with your very own custom logic.&lt;img src=&quot;https://forest-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Github+README+assets/crud.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;CRUD&quot;&gt;### Search &amp; FiltersForest Admin has a built-in search allowing you to run basic queries toretrieve your application's data. Set advanced filters based on fields andrelationships to handle complex search use cases.&lt;img src=&quot;https://forest-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Github+README+assets/search+filters.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Search and Filters&quot;&gt;### Sorting &amp; PaginationSorting and pagination features are natively handled by the Admin API. We'recontinuously optimizing how queries are run in order to display results fasterand reduce the load of your servers.&lt;img src=&quot;https://forest-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Github+README+assets/sorting+pagination.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Sorting and Pagination&quot;&gt;### Custom actionA custom action is a button which allows you to trigger an API call to executea custom logic. With virtually no limitations, you can extend the way youmanipulate data and trigger actions (e.g. refund a customer, apply a coupon,ban a user, etc.)&lt;img src=&quot;https://forest-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Github+README+assets/custom+actions.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Custom action&quot;&gt;### ExportSometimes you need to export your data to a good old fashioned CSV. Yes, weknow this can come in handy sometimes :-)&lt;img src=&quot;https://forest-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Github+README+assets/exports.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Export&quot;&gt;### SegmentsGet in app access to a subset of your application data by doing a basic searchor typing an SQL query or implementing an API route.&lt;img src=&quot;https://forest-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Github+README+assets/segments.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Segments&quot;&gt;### DashboardsForest Admin is able to tap into your actual data to chart out your metricsusing a simple UI panel, a SQL query or a custom API call.&lt;img src=&quot;https://forest-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Github+README+assets/dashboards.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Dashboard&quot;&gt;### WYSIWYGThe WYSIWYG interface saves you a tremendous amount of frontend developmenttime using drag'n'drop as well as advanced widgets to build customizable views.&lt;img src=&quot;https://forest-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Github+README+assets/wysiwyg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;WYSIWYG&quot;&gt;### Custom HTML/JS/CSSCode your own views using JS, HTML, and CSS to display your application data ina more appropriate way (e.g. Kanban, Map, Calendar, Gallery, etc.).&lt;img src=&quot;https://forest-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Github+README+assets/smart+views.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Custom views&quot;&gt;### Team-based permissionsWithout any lines of code, manage directly from the UI who has access or canact on which data using a team-based permission system.&lt;img src=&quot;https://forest-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Github+README+assets/teams.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Team based permissions&quot;&gt;### Third-party integrationsLeverage data from third-party services by reconciling it with yourapplicationâ€™s data and providing it directly to your Admin Panel. All youractions can be performed at the same place, bringing additional intelligence toyour Admin Panel and ensuring consistency.&lt;img src=&quot;https://forest-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Github+README+assets/integrations.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Third-party integrations&quot;&gt;### Notes &amp; CommentsAssign your teammates to specific tasks, leave a note or simply comment arecord, thereby simplifying collaboration all across your organization.&lt;img src=&quot;https://forest-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Github+README+assets/notes+comments.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Notes and Comments&quot;&gt;### Activity logsMonitor each action executed and follow the trail of modification on any datawith an extensive activity log system.&lt;img src=&quot;https://forest-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Github+README+assets/activity+logs.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Activity logs&quot;&gt;## How to contributeThis repository is officially maintained by Forest Admin.We're always happy to get contributions for other fellow lumberjacks.All contributions will be reviewed by Forest Admin's team before being merged into main.Here is the contribution workflow:1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub2. **Clone** the project to your own machine3. **Commit** changes to your own branch4. **Push** your work back up to your fork5.
