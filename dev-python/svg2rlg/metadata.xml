	<longdescription>**svg2rlg** is a python tool to convert SVG files to reportlab graphics.The tool can be used as a console application to convert SVG to PDF files.Known problems ( AKA todo list): * Missing support for elliptical arcs in paths. It is belived to be possible to convert arcs to quadratic beziers. * Text handling is limited. * Style sheets not supported.Note that some limitations are due to limitation in the reportlab graphics package: * No gradients * No text on path * No filling rules (only odd-even)A wxpython tool is included in the distribution which does aside by side comparison to the SVG test suite. Presently mostof the official SVG 1.1 test suite is prefect.</longdescription>
