	<longdescription>Project Plan Module###################The Project Plan module adds planning features on top of the Projectmodule.Allocation**********An allocation links together an employee, a task and a percentage. Itdefines which part of his time the employee should dedicate to thistask.Work****The Work model is extended to support planning features:- Tasks dependencies: Each work may have predecessor and  successors. Predecessor and successor must share the same parent  project.- tasks leveling, I.E. automatically delay some task to avoid  overallocation of resources.- Early Start and Late End computation: If Constraint Start and  Constraint End are set on a work, on its parent work or on one of  the predecessors/successors, the Early Start and Late End dates (but  also Late Start and Early Finish dates) are computed automatically.- Resource allocation: Each task may allocate one or more resource  (I.E. a certain amount of time of an employee).The *Task Leveling* wizard allow to level a group of tasks to avoideventual overallocation of resources, It will delay some tasksdepending on task precedencies and task sequences.</longdescription>
