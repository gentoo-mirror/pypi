It combines the benefits of in-process database engines like SQLite and DuckDB with query federators like Presto and Trino, providing a flexible and intuitive solution that allows users to seamlessly access and query data from various sources in a unified manner.Opteryx offers the following features:- SQL queries on data files generated by other processes such as logs- A command-line tool for filtering, transforming, and combining files- Integration with familiar tools like pandas and Polars- Embeddable as a low-cost engine, enabling portability and allowing for hundreds of analysts to leverage ad hoc databases with ease- Unified and federated access to data on disk, in the cloud, and in on-premises databases, not only through the same interface but in the same query.## Why Use Opteryx?### __Familiar Interface__Opteryx supports key parts of the Python DBAPI and [SQL92 standard](https://opteryx.dev/latest/get-started/external-standards/sql92/) standards which many analysts and engineers will already know how to use.### __Consistent Syntax__Opteryx creates a common SQL-layer over multiple data platforms, allowing backend systems to be upgraded, migrated or consolidated without changing any Opteryx code.### __Bring your own Data__![Opteryx](https://github.com/mabel-dev/opteryx.dev/raw/main/assets/data-stores.png)Opteryx supports multiple query engines, dataframe APIs and storage formats. You can mix-and-match sources in a single query. Opteryx can even `JOIN` datasets stored in different formats, such as Parquet and MySQL.Opteryx allows you to query your data directly in the systems where they are stored, eliminating the need to duplicate data into a common store for analytics. This saves you the cost and effort of maintaining duplicates.Opteryx can push parts of your query to the source query engine, allowing queries to run at the speed of the backend, rather than your local computer.And if there's not a connector in the box for your data platform; bespoke connectors can be added.### __Consumption-Based Billing Friendly__Opteryx is well-suited for deployments to environments which are pay-as-you-use, like Google Cloud Run. Great for situations where you have low-volume usage, or multiple environments, where the costs of many traditional database deployment can quickly add up.### __Python Native__Opteryx is Open Source Python, it quickly and easily integrates into Python code, including Jupyter Notebooks, so you can start querying your data within a few minutes. You can use Opteryx to run SQL against pandas DataFrames, and even execute a `JOIN` on an in-memory DataFrame and a remote dataset.### __Time Travel__Designed for data analytics in environments where decisions need to be replayable, Opteryx allows you to query data as at a point in time in the past to replay decision algorithms against facts as they were known in the past. You can even self-join tables historic data, great for finding deltas in datasets over time. _(data must be structured to enable temporal queries)_### __Fast__Benchmarks on M1 Pro Mac running an ad hoc `GROUP BY` over a 1Gb parquet file via the CLI in ~1/5th of a second, from a cold start. _(different systems will have different performance characteristics)_Rows    | Columns | File Size | Query Time------- | ------- | --------- | ----------561225  | 81      | 1Gb       | 0.22sec1064539 | 81      | 2Gb       | 0.27sec### __Instant Elasticity__Designed to run in Knative and similar environments like Google Cloud Run, Opteryx can scale down to zero, and scale up to respond to thousands of concurrent queries within seconds.## Examples[Install from PyPI](#install-from-pypi)  [Filter a Dataset on the Command Line](#filter-a-dataset-on-the-command-line)  [Execute a Simple Query in Python](#execute-a-simple-query-in-python)   [Execute SQL on a pandas DataFrame](#execute-sql-on-a-pandas-dataframe)   [Query Data on Local Disk](#query-data-on-local-disk)    [Query Data on GCS](#query-data-on-gcs)  [Query Data in SQLite](#query-data-in-sqlite)  [Further Examples](#further-examples)#### Install from PyPI~~~bashpip install opteryx~~~#### Filter a Dataset on the Command LineIn this example, we are running Opteryx from the command line to filter one of the internal example datasets and display the results on the console.~~~bashpython -m opteryx &quot;SELECT * FROM \$astronauts WHERE 'Apollo 11' IN UNNEST(missions);&quot;~~~![Opteryx](https://github.com/mabel-dev/opteryx.dev/raw/main/assets/cli.png)_this example is complete and should run as-is_#### Execute a Simple Query in Python  In this example, we are showing the basic usage of the Python API by executing a simple query that makes no references to any datasets.~~~pythonimport opteryxresult = opteryx.query(&quot;SELECT 4 * 7;&quot;)result.head()~~~~~~   | 4.0*7.0  ===#=========  0 |    28.0 ~~~_this example is complete and should run as-is_#### Execute SQL on a pandas DataFrameIn this example, we are running a SQL statement on a pandas DataFrame and returning the result as a new pandas DataFrame.~~~pythonimport opteryximport pandaspandas_df = pandas.read_csv(&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/opteryx/exoplanets/exoplanets.csv&quot;)opteryx.register_df(&quot;exoplanets&quot;, pandas_df)aggregated_df = opteryx.query(&quot;SELECT koi_disposition, COUNT(*) FROM exoplanets GROUP BY koi_disposition;&quot;).pandas()aggregated_df.head()~~~~~~  koi_disposition  COUNT(*)0       CONFIRMED      22931  FALSE POSITIVE      50232       CANDIDATE      2248 ~~~_this example is complete and should run as-is_#### Query Data on Local DiskIn this example, we are querying and filtering a file directly.
