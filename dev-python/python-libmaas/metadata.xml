	<longdescription># python-libmaasPython client API library made especially for [MAAS][].[![CI tests](https://github.com/maas/python-libmaas/workflows/CI%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/maas/python-libmaas/actions?query=workflow%3A%22CI+tests%22)[![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/maas/python-libmaas/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/maas/python-libmaas?branch=master)## InstallationAll the dependencies are declared in `setup.py` so this can be installedwith [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/). Python 3.5+ is required.When working from master it can be helpful to use a virtualenv:    $ python3 -m venv ve &amp;&amp; source ve/bin/activate    $ pip install git+https://github.com/maas/python-libmaas.git    $ maas --helpReleases are periodically made to [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/) but,at least for now, it makes more sense to work directly from trunk.## DocumentationDocumentation can be generated with `make docs` which publishes into the`site` directory. Recent documentation is also published to the[MAAS Client Library &amp; CLI documentation][docs] site.## DevelopmentIt's pretty easy to start hacking on _python-libmaas_:    $ git clone git@github.com:maas/python-libmaas.git    $ cd python-libmaas    $ make develop    $ make testInstalling [IPython][] is generally a good idea too:    $ bin/pip install -UI IPythonPull requests are welcome but authors need to sign the [Canonicalcontributor license agreement][CCLA] before those PRs can be merged.## History &amp; licenceIn short: [AGPLv3][]._python-libmaas_ was begun by a core MAAS developer, Gavin Panella, onhis own time, but is now maintained by the core MAAS team at Canonical.It is licensed under the GNU Affero GPLv3, the same as MAAS itself.Some of the code in here has come from MAAS, upon which Canonical Ltdhas the copyright. Gavin Panella licenses his parts under the AGPLv3,and MAAS is also under the AGPLv3, so everything should be good.[MAAS]: https://maas.io/[docs]: http://maas.github.io/python-libmaas/[CCLA]: https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/contributors[AGPLv3]: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html[IPython]: https://ipython.org/</longdescription>
