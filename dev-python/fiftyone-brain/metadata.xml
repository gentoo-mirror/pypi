Although it is closed-source, itis licensed as freeware, and you have permission to use it for commercial ornon-commercial purposes. See the license below for more details.The FiftyOne Brain methods are useful across the stages of the machine learningworkflow:-   **[Uniqueness](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/brain.html#image-uniqueness):**    During the training loop for a model, the best results will be seen when    training on unique data. The FiftyOne Brain provides a uniqueness measure    for images that compare the content of every image in a FiftyOne Dataset    with all other images. Uniqueness operates on raw images and does not    require any prior annotation on the data. It is hence very useful in the    early stages of the machine learning workflow when you are likely asking    &quot;What data should I select to annotate?&quot;-   **[Mistakenness](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/brain.html#label-mistakes):**    Annotations mistakes create an artificial ceiling on the performance of    your models. However, finding these mistakes by hand is at least as arduous    as the original annotation was, especially in cases of larger datasets. The    FiftyOne Brain provides a quantitative mistakenness measure to identify    possible label mistakes. Mistakenness operates on labeled images and    requires the logit-output of your model predictions in order to provide    maximum efficacy. It also works on detection datasets to find missed    objects, incorrect annotations, and localization issues.-   **[Hardness](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/user_guide/brain.html#sample-hardness):**    While a model is training, it will learn to understand attributes of    certain samples faster than others. The FiftyOne Brain provides a hardness    measure that calculates how easy or difficult it is for your model to    understand any given sample. Mining hard samples is a tried and true    measure of mature machine learning processes. Use your current model    instance to compute predictions on unlabeled samples to determine which are    the most valuable to have annotated and fed back into the system as    training samples, for example.## LicenseCopyright 2022, Voxel51, Inc.All rights reserved.FREEWARE LICENSE AND END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENTFor the FiftyOne BrainTL;DRThe functionality in the FiftyOne Brain software package is closed-source,freeware.
