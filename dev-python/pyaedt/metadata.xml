The architecturefor PyAEDT can be reused for all AEDT 3D products (HFSS, Icepak, Maxwell 3D,and Q3D Extractor), 2D tools, and Ansys Mechanical. PyAEDT also providessupport for circuit tools like Nexxim and system simulation tools likeTwin Builder. Finally, PyAEDT provides scripting capabilities in Ansys layouttools like HFSS 3D Layout and EDB. The PyAEDT class and method structuressimplify operation while reusing information as much as possible acrossthe API.## Install on CPython from PyPIYou can install PyAEDT on CPython 3.7 through 3.10 from PyPI with this command:```sh  pip install pyaedt```Install `PyAEDT` with all extra packages (matplotlib, numpy, pandas, pyvista):```sh  pip install pyaedt[full]```You can also install PyAEDT from Conda-Forge with this command:```sh  conda install -c conda-forge pyaedt```PyAEDT remains compatible with IronPython and can be still used in the AEDT Framework.## About PyAnsys`PyAEDT` is part of the larger [PyAnsys](https://docs.pyansys.com &quot;PyAnsys&quot;) effort to facilitate the use of Ansys technologies directly from Python.PyAEDT is intended to consolidate and extend all existingfunctionalities around scripting for AEDT to allow reuse of existing code,sharing of best practices, and increased collaboration.## About AEDT[AEDT](https://www.ansys.com/products/electronics) is a platform that enables trueelectronics system design. AEDT provides access to the Ansys gold-standardelectro-magnetics simulation solutions, such as Ansys HFSS, Ansys Maxwell,Ansys Q3D Extractor, Ansys Siwave, and Ansys Icepak using electrical CAD (ECAD) andMechanical CAD (MCAD) workflows.In addition, AEDT includes direct links to the complete Ansys portfolio of thermal, fluid,and mechanical solvers for comprehensive multiphysics analysis.Tight integration among these solutions provides unprecedented ease of use for setup andfaster resolution of complex simulations for design and optimization.&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;https://images.ansys.com/is/image/ansys/ansys-electronics-technology-collage?wid=941&amp;op_usm=0.9,1.0,20,0&amp;fit=constrain,0&quot; title=&quot;AEDT Applications&quot; herf=&quot;https://www.ansys.com/products/electronics&quot;  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;`PyAEDT` is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/pyansys/PyAEDT/blob/main/LICENSE)`PyAEDT` includes functionality for interacting with the following `AEDT tools` and `Ansys products`:  - HFSS and HFSS 3D Layout  - Icepak  - Maxwell 2D, Maxwell 3D, and RMXprt  - 2D Extractor and Q3D Extractor  - Mechanical  - Nexxim  - EDB  - Twin Builder## Documentation and issuesIn addition to installation and usage information, the `PyAEDT` documentation provides [API reference](https://aedt.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable), [Examples](https://aedt.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/examples/index.html), and [Contribute](https://aedt.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/Contributing.html) sections.In the upper right corner of the documentation's title bar, there is an optionfor switching from viewing the documentation for the latest stable releaseto viewing the documentation for the development version or previouslyreleased versions.On the [PyAEDT Issues](https://github.com/pyansys/PyAEDT/issues) page, you cancreate issues to submit questions, report bugs, and request new features.To reach the project support team, email `pyansys.core@ansys.com &lt;pyansys.core@ansys.com&gt;`_.## DependenciesTo run `PyAEDT`, you must have a local licenced copy of AEDT.`PyAEDT` supports AEDT versions 2022 R1 or newer.## Student version`PyAEDT` supports `AEDT Student version 2022 R1` and later. For more information, see [Student Version page](https://www.ansys.com/academic/students/ansys-electronics-desktop-student).## Why PyAEDT?A quick and easy approach for automating a simple operation in the AEDT UI is to record and reuse a script. However, disadvantages of this approach are:  - Recorded code is dirty and difficult to read and understand.  - Recorded scripts are difficult to reuse and adapt.  - Complex coding is required by many global users of `AEDT`.The main advantages of `PyAEDT` are:  - Automatic initialization of all `AEDT` objects, such as desktop objects like the editor, boundaries, and so on  - Error management  - Log management  - Variable management  - Compatibility with IronPython and CPython  - Simplification of complex API syntax using data objects while maintaining PEP8 compliance.  - Code reusability across different solvers  - Clear documentation on functions and API  - Unit tests of code to increase quality across different AEDT versions## Example workflow 1. Initialize the ``Desktop`` class with the version of `AEDT` to use. 2. Initialize the application to use within `AEDT`.## Connect to AEDT from Python IDE``PyAEDT`` works both inside AEDT and as a standalone application. This Python library automatically detects whether it is running in an IronPython or CPython environment and initializes AEDT accordingly.``PyAEDT`` also provides advanced error management. Usage examples follow.## Explicit AEDT declaration and error management``` python    # Launch AEDT 2022 R2 in non-graphical mode    from pyaedt import Desktop, Circuit    with Desktop(specified_version=&quot;2022.2&quot;,                 non_graphical=False, new_desktop_session=True,                 close_on_exit=True, student_version=False):        circuit = Circuit()        ...        # Any error here will be caught by Desktop.        ...    # Desktop is automatically released here.```## Implicit AEDT declaration and error management``` python    # Launch the latest installed version of AEDT in graphical mode    from pyaedt import Circuit    with Circuit(specified_version=&quot;2022.2&quot;,                 non_graphical=False) as circuit:        ...        # Any error here will be caught by Desktop.        ...    # Desktop is automatically released here.```## Remote application callYou can make a remote application call on a CPython serveror any Windows client machine.On a CPython Server:``` python    # Launch PyAEDT remote server on CPython    from pyaedt.common_rpc import pyaedt_service_manager    pyaedt_service_manager()```On any Windows client machine:``` python    from pyaedt.common_rpc import create_session    cl1 = create_session(&quot;server_name&quot;)    cl1.aedt(port=50000, non_graphical=False)    hfss = Hfss(machine=&quot;server_name&quot;, port=50000)    # your code here```## Variables``` python    from pyaedt.HFSS import HFSS    with HFSS as hfss:         hfss[&quot;dim&quot;] = &quot;1mm&quot;   # design variable         hfss[&quot;$dim&quot;] = &quot;1mm&quot;  # project variable```## Modeler``` python    # Create a box, assign variables, and assign materials.    from pyaedt.hfss import Hfss    with Hfss as hfss:         hfss.modeler.create_box([0, 0, 0], [10, &quot;dim&quot;, 10],                                 &quot;mybox&quot;, &quot;aluminum&quot;)```## License`PyAEDT` is licensed under the `MIT` license.This module makes no commercial claim over Ansys whatsoever. `PyAEDT` extends the functionality of `AEDT` by adding an additional Python interface to `AEDT` without changing the core behavior or license of the original software. The use of the interactive control of `PyAEDT` requires a legally licensed local copy of `AEDT`.
