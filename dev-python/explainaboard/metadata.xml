ExplainaBoard is a tool that *inspects your systemoutputs*, *identifies what is working and what is not working*, and helps *inspire youwith ideas of where to go next*.&lt;img src=&quot;./fig/intro.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;It offers a number of different ways with which you can evaluate and understand your systems:1. *Single-system Analysis*: What is a system good or bad at?2. *Pairwise Analysis*: Where is one system better (worse) than another?3. *Fine-grained Error Analysis*: On what examples do errors occur?4. *Holistic Leaderboards and Benchmarks*: Which systems perform best for a particular task?## Using ExplainaboardExplainaBoard can be used online or offline. For most users, we recommend using theonline interface, as it is more interactive and easier to get started.### Online UsageBrowse the [**web interface**](https://explainaboard.inspiredco.ai), which gives you theability to browse outputs and evaluate and analyze your own system outputs.&lt;a href=&quot;https://explainaboard.inspiredco.ai&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./fig/demo-v2.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you would like to evaluate and analyze your own systems programmatically, you canuse the&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neulab/explainaboard_client&quot;&gt;ExplainaBoard client&lt;/a&gt;.### Offline UsageFor power-users who want to use ExplainaBoard offline, first, follow the installation directionsbelow, then take a look at our [**CLI examples**](docs/cli_interface.md).**Install Method 1 - Standard Use:** Simple installation from PyPI (Python 3 only)```bashpip install --upgrade pip  # recommending the newest version of pip.pip install explainaboardpython -m spacy download en_core_web_sm  # if you plan to use the AspectBasedSentimentClassificationProcessor```**Install Method 2 - Development:** Install from the source and develop locally (Python3 only)```bash# Clone current repogit clone https://github.com/neulab/ExplainaBoard.gitcd ExplainaBoard# Install the required dependencies and dev dependenciespip install .&quot;[dev]&quot;python -m spacy download en_core_web_smpre-commit install```- **Testing:** To run tests, you can run `python -m unittest`.- **Linting and Code Style:** This project uses flake8 (linter) and black (formatter).  They are enforced in the pre-commit hook and in the CI pipeline.  - run `python -m black .` to format code  - run `flake8` to lint code  - You can also configure your IDE to automatically format and lint the files as you    are writing code.After trying things out in the [CLI](docs/cli_interface.md), you can read how to addnew [features](docs/add_new_features.md), [tasks](docs/add_new_tasks.md), or[file formats](docs/add_new_formats.md).## AcknowledgementExplainaBoard is developed by Carnegie Mellon University, Inspired Cognition Inc., andother collaborators.
