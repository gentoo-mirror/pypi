Firstly, Margot makesit super easy tocreate neat and tidy Pandas dataframes for time-series analysis.Margot manages data collection, caching, cleaning, feature generation,management and persistence using a clean, declarative API. If you'veever used Django you will find this approach similar to the Django ORM.Margot also provides a simple framework for writing and backtesting systematictrading algorithms.Results from margot's trading algorithms can be analysed using pyfolio.# Getting Started    pip install margotNext you need to make sure you have a couple of important environment variablesset::    export ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY    export DATA_CACHE=PATH_TO_FOLDER_TO_STORE_HDF5_FILESOnce you've done that, try running the code in the [notebook](notebook.margot.data).# StatusThis is still an early stage software project, and should not be used for livetrading just yet.# DocumentationThe documentation is at [readthedocs](https://margot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).# ContributingFeel free to make a pull request or chat about your idea first using [issues](https://github.com/atkinson/margot/issues).Dependencies are kept to a minimum. Generally if there's a way to do somethingin the standard library (or numpy / Pandas), let's do it that way rather thanadd another library. # LicenseMargot is licensed for use under Apache 2.0.
