During the event, we tryand make as many radio contacts with other Hams in a 24 hour period. Bonuspoints are awarded for operating outside or using alternate power sources, suchas battery/solar/wind. You can find out more about Winter Field Day by visitingthe [WFDA](https://winterfieldday.com/). You can find out more about amateur radioby visiting the [ARRL](https://www.arrl.org/).The logger is written in Python 3, and uses the PyQT5 lib. Qt5 is crossplatform so it might work on everything. I have tested it on Linux, RasperryPi OS and Windows 10. This code is based off of a logger I had done earlierusing Python and the curses library wich can be found[here](https://github.com/mbridak/wfd_py_logger) and one written for ARRLField Day [here](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger).The log is stored in an sqlite3 database file 'WFD.db'. If you need to wipeeverything and start clean, just delete this file and re-run wfdloggerThe logger client will generate a cabrillo for submission, An ADIF file so youcan merge contacts into your normal Log, and a Statistics file with a band modebreakdown.The server if used, will generate a group cabrillo file to submit.![Snapshot of main screen](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/loggerscreenshot.png)## Table Of Contents- [K6GTE Winter Field Day logger (PyQt5)](#k6gte-winter-field-day-logger-pyqt5)  - [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents)  - [Caveats](#caveats)  - [Recent Changes](#recent-changes)  - [WB8ERJ's blog writeup](#wb8erjs-blog-writeup)  - [Installing, Updating, Removing Client](#installing-updating-removing-client)  - [Running Client](#running-client)  - [The Server](#the-server)    - [Server install](#server-install)    - [Server Documentation](#server-documentation)  - [What to do first](#what-to-do-first)  - [Logging](#logging)  - [Features](#features)    - [Radio Polling via flrig or rigctld](#radio-polling-via-flrig-or-rigctld)    - [Cloudlog, QRZ, HamDB, HamQTH useage](#cloudlog-qrz-hamdb-hamqth-useage)    - [N1MM packets for Node-Red Dashboard](#n1mm-packets-for-node-red-dashboard)    - [XPlanet marker file](#xplanet-marker-file)    - [Editing an existing contact](#editing-an-existing-contact)    - [Super Check Partial](#super-check-partial)    - [Section partial check](#section-partial-check)    - [DUP checking](#dup-checking)    - [Autofill](#autofill)  - [CW](#cw)    - [CW Settings](#cw-settings)    - [CW Macros](#cw-macros)    - [CW Macros (Run vs S\&amp;P)](#cw-macros-run-vs-sp)    - [cwdaemon speed changes and stop sending](#cwdaemon-speed-changes-and-stop-sending)  - [When the event is over](#when-the-event-is-over)  - [Group / Club logging](#group--club-logging)  - [Server configuration](#server-configuration)  - [Client configuration for groups](#client-configuration-for-groups)  - [Chat Window](#chat-window)  - [How to know the server is there](#how-to-know-the-server-is-there)  - [Logging reliability](#logging-reliability)  - [Generating the cabrillo file](#generating-the-cabrillo-file)  - [I'm sure there are short cummings](#im-sure-there-are-short-cummings)## CaveatsWFD only has a generic digital mode designator 'DI', which gets exported to thecabrillo file. But ADIF and CloudLog needed something else, So I Chose RTTY.Feel free to change it to what ever you will use. Just search for the twoplaces in the code 'RTTY' is used and Bob's your dads brother.## Recent Changes- [23-2-3] Added visual cue as to validity of logged class and section.- [23-1-30] Changed Cabrillo tag 'CONTEST' to WFD.- [23.1.28] xplanet markers not generating.- [23.1.27] Fixed order of CW macro buttons.- [23.1.23] Visual tweaks- [23.1.20] UI now resizable.- [23.1.14] Safer access to dict keys.- [23.1.14] Added app icons.- [22.12.28] Repackaged for pypi pip installation.- [22.12.28] Removed use of BeautifulSoup and lxml. Migrated to xmltodict.- [22.12.27] WFDA preferres `DG` as the mode indicator for digital.- [22.12.16] Changed the RAC sections for 2023. Thanks for the heads up WB8ERJ!- [22.11.12] 2023 scoring and antenna bonus.- [22.10.13] Added N1MM XML status packets. So you can use [Kyle AA0Z's Node-Red dashboard](https://github.com/kylekrieg/Node-Red-Contesting-Dashboard).- [22.10.9] Added a group contact aggregation server. So multiple clients can participate in WFD together.## WB8ERJ's blog writeup[Mike's Tech Blog WB8ERJ](https://mikestechblog.com/how-to-install-winter-field-day-logging-software-for-raspberry-pi/)## Installing, Updating, Removing Client```bash#installpip install wfdlogger#updatepip install -U wfdlogger#removepip uninstall wfdlogger```## Running ClientIn a terminal type:```bashwfdlogger```## The Server### Server install```bashpip install wfdserver```### Server Documentation[wfdserver](https://github.com/mbridak/wfdserver)## What to do firstOn first run, there will be a dialog box asking you for your call class andsection. if you need to change this later, the entry fields can be found atthe bottom of the screen.If you're participating as a member of a group, do not put your groups/clubcall as your call. Enter your own call. The group call will be polled fromthe server.![Snapshot focused on bottom of window](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/yourstuff.png)## LoggingOkay you've made a contact. Enter the call in the call field. As you type itin, it will do a super check partial (see below). Press TAB or SPACE to advanceto the next field. Once the call is complete it will do a DUP check (see below).It will try and Autofill the next fields (see below). When entering thesection, it will do a section partial check (see below). Press the ENTER keyto submit the Q to the log. If it's a busted call or a dup, press the ESC keyto clear all inputs and start again.## Features### Radio Polling via flrig or rigctldIf you run flrig or rigctld on a computer connected to the radio, it can bepolled for band/mode updates automatically. Click the gear icon at the bottomof the screen to set the IP and port. There is a radio icon at the bottom ofthe logging window to indicate polling status.![Snapshot of settings dialog](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/catSettings.png)### Cloudlog, QRZ, HamDB, HamQTH useageIf you use either Cloudlog logging or QRZ/HamDB/HamQTH lookup you can clickthe gear icon to enter your credentials.Q's are pushed to CloudLog as soon as they are logged.The QRZ/HamDB/HamQTH lookup is only used to get the Op name and gridsquare forthe call. Mainly because when a Q is pushed to CloudLog it will not show as apin on the map unless it has a gridsquare. So this is a scratch my own itchfeature. HAMDB.org is used by default since it's free. If both are checked itwill it will use QRZ then fallback to HAMDB.### N1MM packets for Node-Red DashboardIf you wish to use Kyle AA0Z's Node-Red contest dashboard, edit these settings.![N1MM settings](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/n1mm_settings.png)### XPlanet marker fileIf you use QRZ/HamdDB/HamQTH lookups you can also generate an[XPlanet](http://xplanet.sourceforge.net/) markerfile which will show littlepips on the map as contacts are logged.![Snapshot of xplanet window](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/xplanet.png)The above launched with an example command:```bashxplanet -body earth -window -longitude -117 -latitude 38 -config Default -projection azmithal -radius 200 -wait 5```### Editing an existing contactDouble click a contact in the upper left of the screen to edit or delete it.![Snapshot of edit qso dialog](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/editqso.png)### Super Check PartialIf you type more than two characters in the callsign field the program willfilter the input through a &quot;Super Check Partial&quot; routine and show you possiblematches to known contesting call signs. Is this useful? Doubt it.![Snapshot of main screen focused on super check partial output](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/scp.png)### Section partial checkAs you type the section abbreviation you are presented with a list of allpossible sections that start with what you have typed.![Snapshot of main screen focused on section check partial output](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/sectioncheck.png)### DUP checkingOnce you type a complete callsign and press TAB or SPACE to advance to thenext field. The callsign is checked against previous callsigns in your log.It will list any prior contact made showing the band and mode of the contact.If the band and mode are the same as the one you are currently using, thelisting will be highlighted, the screen will flash, a bell will sound to alertyou that this is a DUP. At this point you and the other OP can argue back andforth about who's wrong. In the end you'll put your big boy pants on and makea decision if you'll enter the call or not.![Snapshot of main screen focused on dup checking output](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/dupe.png)### AutofillIf you have worked this person before on another band/mode the program willload the class and section used previously for this call so you will not haveto enter this info again.## CW### CW SettingsSupport is provided for both cwdaemon and PyWinkeyer.![Settings dialog tab for CW](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/cw_settings.png)Defalt port for cwdaemon is 6789 and for PyWinkeyer is 8000.### CW MacrosThe program will check in the current working directory for a file called`cwmacros.txt` It will parse the fileand configure the row of 12 buttons along the bottom half of the window.The macros can be activated by either pressing the corresponding function key,or by directly clicking on the button. You can check the file to glean it'sstructure, but it's pretty straight forward. Each line has 4 sections separatedby the pipe `|` character.Here's an example line.`R|F2|Run Exch|{HISCALL} {MYCLASS} {MYSECT}`The first field is an `R` if the macro is to be shown while in Run mode.Otherwise an `S` for Search and Pounce. The second field is the function keyto program. The third is the text label to put in the button. Lastly thefourth is the text you would like to send.A limited set of substitution macros are offered.`{MYCALL}``{HISCALL}``{MYCLASS}``{MYSECT}`These are pulled straight from the onscreen input fields. Combined with normaltext this should have you covered for most of your exchange needs.### CW Macros (Run vs S&amp;P)You can toggle the macros in use between Run and Search and Pounce by clickingthe button to the left of the Generate Logs button at the botton right portionof the screen.![Picture showing buttons](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/run_sp.png)This can also be used to reload the macros if you edit them while the programis running.### cwdaemon speed changes and stop sendingIf you are using cwedaemon for sending, you can use:`CTRL+Esc` to abort sending.`PgUp` Increase sending speed.`PgDown` Decrease sending speed.## When the event is overAfter the big weekend, once you've swept up all the broken beer bottles andwiped the BBQ sauce off your chin, go ahead and click the Generate Logs button.![Snapshot of main screen focused on generate logs button](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/genlog.png)This will generate the following:An ADIF log 'WFD.adi'.A Cabrillo log 'Yourcall.log'. Which you edit to fill in your address etc. Ifyour not using Windows, you must ensure whatever editor you use uses CR/LFline endings. Cause whatever they use at the Winter Field Day society willchoke with out them. To be safe you might want to run it through 'unix2dos'before submitting it.A 'Statistics.txt' file which breaks down your band mode usage. Each uniqueband/mode combo is a multiplier.## Group / Club loggingI have added a group contact aggrigating server. This can be run on the samecomputer as the client program, or on a separate dedicated PC or Raspberry Pion the same network.![Picture showing main server screen](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/server_pic.png)## Server configurationThe configuration file for the server is a JSON file 'server_preferences.json'.It's generated automatically on the first run of the server `wfdserver`.So start the server then press CTRL-C to quit it, then edit the josn file.```json{    &quot;ourcall&quot;: &quot;W1AW&quot;,    &quot;ourclass&quot;: &quot;3O&quot;,    &quot;oursection&quot;: &quot;ORG&quot;,    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Hiram Maxim&quot;,    &quot;address&quot;: &quot;225 Main Street&quot;,    &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Newington&quot;,    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;CT&quot;,    &quot;postalcode&quot;: &quot;06111&quot;,    &quot;country&quot;: &quot;USA&quot;,    &quot;email&quot;: &quot;Hiram.Maxim@arrl.net&quot;,    &quot;bonus&quot;: {        &quot;altpower&quot;: false,        &quot;outdoors&quot;: false,        &quot;notathome&quot;: false,        &quot;antenna&quot;: false,        &quot;satellite&quot;: false    },    &quot;mullticast_group&quot;: &quot;224.1.1.1&quot;,    &quot;multicast_port&quot;: 2239,    &quot;interface_ip&quot;: &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;,    &quot;node_red_server_ip&quot;: &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;,    &quot;node_red_server_port&quot;: 12062}```Feel free to leave the last 3 items as they are unless you have goodreason not too. The rest should be straight forward.Under the bonuses section, if your group qualifies for a bonus, put `true` nextto the type of bonus.## Client configuration for groupsIn the settings dialog there is now a tab labeled 'Group Operation'.![Picture showing settings dialog tab](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/group_server_settings.png)Go ahead and place a check next to 'Connect to server'. Rejoyce and letmerriment be had by all. Be sure and have your callsign already set beforechecking this. If you forgot, Uncheck it, set your callsign and then check it.A couple of things will change on the client when this is done. You will seethat your callsign will disappear and be replaced with your clubs call that theserver reports. The portion of the screen where all the different ARRL sectionsare displayed will be replaced by a group chat window and a column showing thestation call, band and mode of other participants.![Picture showing logger screen changes](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/group_chat.png)If more than one operator is on the same band/mode, their names will behighlighted in the operators list. Feel free to yell at eachother in the chat.![Picture showing band and mode conflict](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/band_conflict_client.png)## Chat WindowThe chat window is pretty straight forward. If someone mentions you in the chatthat line will be highlighted with an accent color. If you find the font sizedoes not work for you, can adjust the size by: Placing your mouse cursor in thechat window, then rotate your mouse wheel while holding down the Control key.There is one command you can type into the chat window that may be of use.if you type @stats into the window the server will dump out the groups statsinto the chat.```textServer: Band   CW    PH    DG 160     0     0     0  80     0     0    25  40     0   159     0  20     1   162   126  15     0     0     0  10     0     0     0   6     0    17     0   2     0     0     0Score: 1284Last Hour: 271Last 15: 81```Since most people will not be able to see the screen of the server, if it hasone at all. You may find this useful.## How to know the server is thereMost likely, the server will be in some other tent/building/area of the room.Every 10 seconds or so the server will send out a UDP network packet sayingit's there. As long as your client keeps seeing these packets the group callindicator at the bottom of the screen will look like:![Picture showing server status](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/server_okay.png)But if about 30 seconds go by with no update from the server, the indicatorwill change to:![Picture showing server status](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/server_not_pinging.png)Go check on it.## Logging reliabilityAs mentioned before, We're using UDP traffic to pass data back and forth to theserver. UDP traffic is a 'Fire and forget' method. Akin to a bunch of peoplein the same room yelling at eachother. Everyone can hear you, but you don'tknow if anyone heard what you said. This has both advantages and disadvantages.One advantage is that your program is not stuck waiting for a reply or timeout,locking up your user interface. The disadvantage is you have no idea if anyonetook note of what you had said.This works fine in a local network since the traffic doesn't have to survivethe trip through the big bad tubes of the internet. That being said, someonemay trip on a cord, unplugging the router/switch/wireless gateway. Or someonemay be trying to use WIFI and they are Soooooo far away you can barely seetheir tent. Or worse you have EVERYONE on WIFI, and there are packet collisionsgalore degrading your network.To account for this, the client logging program keeps track of recent packetssent, noting the time they were sent at. The server after getting a packet,generates a response to the sender with it's unique identifyer. Once the clientgets the response from the server, it will remove the request on the local sideand print a little message giving you a visual confirmation that the command wasacted upon by the server. If the server does not respond either because theresponse was lost or the request never made it to reply too. The client willresend the packet every 30 seconds until it gets a reply.But all this may still result in the server not having a copy of your contact.To account for this, when the &quot;Generate Logs&quot; button is pressed on the client,the client will resend all the logged contacts that have not gotten responsesfrom the server. You can keep doing this, if need be,  until it gets them all.There is a visual indicator giving you an idea of how many if any contacts havenot been verified. The `Generate Logs` button will change serving this purpose.![picture of generate log button showing count of unverified contacts](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/unverified_indicator.png)The client will resend all the unverified contacts to the server as part ofthe log generation process.Chat traffic is best effort. Either everyone sees your plea for more beer orthey don't. No retry is made for chat traffic. Just get your butt up and makethe trip to the cooler.## Generating the cabrillo fileIf any of the networked clients presses the 'Generate Logs' button on theirscreen, the server will be told to generate it's cabrillo file, it will benamed 'WhatEverYourClubCallIs.log'.Later you can also launch the server with '-l' flag on the command lineand the server will generate the log and then exit.## I'm sure there are short cummingsIt's early days, and I've mainly tested the operations with the client loggingprogram and several simulated operators, see file in `testing/simulant.py`.Real world use for Winter Field Day outside of January is hard to come by. So I'm surethere are a couple of things I forgot, or didn't account for.If you are part of a group of linux using Hams, please take this for a spin andtell me what I missed or could do better. Like a dry run, to make sure I'm not an idiot.</longdescription>
