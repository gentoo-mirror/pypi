	<longdescription>Starlark-PyO3: Python bindings for starlark-rust================================================.. image:: https://github.com/inducer/starlark-pyo3/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main&amp;event=push    :alt: Github Build Status    :target: https://github.com/inducer/starlark-pyo3/actions?query=branch%3Amain+workflow%3ACI+event%3Apush.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/starlark-pyo3.png    :alt: Python Package Index Release Page    :target: https://pypi.org/project/starlark-pyo3/This package provides a sandboxed/restricted Python-like environment by exposing the`starlark-rust &lt;https://github.com/facebookexperimental/starlark-rust/&gt;`__interpreter for the`Starlark &lt;https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark/blob/master/spec.md&gt;`__Python-like language to Python via `PyO3 &lt;https://pyo3.rs&gt;`__.`Starlark &lt;https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark&gt;`__ claims the following*design principles*:-   **Deterministic evaluation**. Executing the same code twice will give the    same results.-   **Hermetic execution**. Execution cannot access the file system, network,    system clock. It is safe to execute untrusted code.-   **Parallel evaluation**. Modules can be loaded in parallel. To guarantee a    thread-safe execution, shared data becomes immutable.-   **Simplicity**. We try to limit the number of concepts needed to understand    the code. Users should be able to quickly read and write code, even if they    are not expert. The language should avoid pitfalls as much as possible.-   **Focus on tooling**. We recognize that the source code will be read,    analyzed, modified, by both humans and tools.-   **Python-like**. Python is a widely used language. Keeping the language    similar to Python can reduce the learning curve and make the semantics more    obvious to users.*Status:* This is reasonably complete and usable.Links------  `Documentation &lt;https://documen.tician.de/starlark-pyo3/&gt;`__-  `Github &lt;https://github.com/inducer/starlark-pyo3&gt;`__ (issues etc.)-  `Package index &lt;https://pypi.org/project/starlark-pyo3&gt;`__Installation ------------To install, say::    pip install starlark-pyo3Binary wheels are available for all major platforms.  The module is importableas ``starlark``.Installation for Development----------------------------To use this, make sure you have nightly rust available::    curl –proto ‘=https’ –tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs \| sh rustup    default nightlyThen, to install into the current Python virtual environment::    pip install maturin    maturin develop</longdescription>
