Can be empty if the file contained errors and  could not be recognised upon download* `FILESAVED` file and thumbnail download status as a 3bit flag:`xx1` if thumbnail was downloaded, `xx0` if not; `x1x`  if at least one file was valid `x0x` if not; `1xx` if all given files where valid, `0xx` if not. Possible values  are `0` through `7` (3 bit).* `FAVORITE` a bar-separated list of users that have &quot;faved&quot; the submission* `MENTIONS` a bar-separated list of users that are mentioned in the submission description as links* `FOLDER` the folder of the submission (`gallery` or `scraps`)* `USERUPDATE` `1` if the submission was added as a user update otherwise `0`### JournalsThe journals' table contains the metadata of the journals downloaded by the program.* `ID` the id of the journal* `AUTHOR` the username of the author (uploader) in full format* `TITLE`* `DATE` upload date in ISO format _YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM_* `CONTENT` content in HTML or BBCode format* `HEADER` header in HTML or BBCode format* `FOOTER` footer in HTML or BBCode format* `MENTIONS` a bar-separated list of users that are mentioned in the journal content as links* `USERUPDATE` `1` if the journal was added as a user update otherwise `0`### CommentsThe comments' table contains the metadata of the journals and submissions stored in the database.* `ID` the id of the comment* `PARENT_TABLE` `SUBMISSIONS` if the comment relates to a submission, `JOURNAL` if the comment relates to a journal* `PARENT_ID` the id of the parent object (submission or journal)* `REPLY_TO` the id of the parent comment, if the comment is a reply* `AUTHOR` the username of the author in full format* `DATE` post date in ISO format _YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS_* `TEXT` the text of the comment### SettingsThe settings table contains settings for the program and variable used by the database handler and main program.* `COOKIES` cookies for the download program, stored in JSON format* `FILESFOLDER` location of downloaded submission files* `VERSION` database version### HistoryThe history table holds events related to the database.* `TIME` event time in ISO format _YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ssssss_* `EVENT` the event description## Submission FilesThe `save_submission` functions saves the submission metadata in the database and stores the files.Submission files are saved in a tiered tree structure based on their submission ID. IDs are zero-padded to 10 digits andthen broken up in 5 segments of 2 digits; each of these segments represents a folder tha will be created in the tree.For example, a submission `1457893` will be padded to `0001457893` and divided into `00`, `01`, `45`, `78`, `93`. Thesubmission file will then be saved as `00/01/45/78/93/submission.file` with the correct extension extracted from thefile itself (FurAffinity links do not always contain the right extension and sometimes confuse JPEG and PNG).## Upgrading Database_Note:_ versions prior to 4.19.0 are not supported by falocalrepo-database version 5.0.0 and above. To update fromthose, use [falocalrepo v3.25.0](https://pypi.org/project/falocalrepo/v3.25.0) to upgrade the database to version4.19.0.&lt;br/&gt;_Note:_ Versions prior to 2.7.0 are not supported by falocalrepo-database version 3.0.0 and above.
