When it's installed in the same environment asspaCy, this package makes the resources for each language available as an entrypoint, which spaCy checks when setting up the `Vocab` and `Lookups`.Feel free to submit pull requests to update the data. For issues related to thedata, lookups and integration, please use the[spaCy issue tracker](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues).[![Azure Pipelines](&lt;https://img.shields.io/azure-devops/build/explosion-ai/public/13/master.svg?logo=azure-pipelines&amp;style=flat-square&amp;label=build+(3.x)&gt;)](https://dev.azure.com/explosion-ai/public/_build?definitionId=12)[![Current Release Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/explosion/spacy-lookups-data.svg?include_prereleases&amp;style=flat-square&amp;logo=github)](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-lookups-data/releases)[![pypi Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/spacy-lookups-data.svg?style=flat-square&amp;logo=pypi&amp;logoColor=white)](https://pypi.org/project/spacy-lookups-data/)[![conda Version](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/spacy-lookups-data.svg?style=flat-square&amp;logo=conda-forge&amp;logoColor=white)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/spacy-lookups-data)## FAQ### Why does this exist?The main purpose of this package is to make the default spaCy installationsmaller and not force every user to download large data files for _all_languages by default. Lookups data is now either provided **via the pre-trainedmodels** (which serialize out their vocabulary and lookup tables) or by**explicitly installing this package** or `spacy[lookups]`.### When should I install this?You should install this package if you want to use lemmatization for languagesthat don't yet have a [pretrained model](https://spacy.io/models) available fordownload and don't rely on third-party libraries for lemmatization â€“ forexample, **Turkish**, **Swedish** or **Croatian**([see data files](spacy_lookups_data/data)).If you are training new models with spaCy, you should probably install this,since it contains lemmatization and normalization data for 25+ languages thatis no longer included as part of the main spaCy library. In particular, youshould install it if you're creating a **blank model** and you want it toinclude lemmatization and normalization data. Once you've saved out the model(e.g. via `nlp.disk`), it will include the lookup tables as part of its`Vocab`.### Is this package only for lemmatization?This package used to only be for lemmatization, but it has been extended toinclude normalization data for many languages. As of v0.3.1 it also includesoptional probability and Brown cluster data that used to be distributed withprovided models in spaCy v2.2 but is no longer included in spaCy v2.3. In thefuture it may include other lookup lists and tables as well, e.g. largetokenizer exception files.## Running testsThis package now also includes all[data-specific tests](spacy_lookups_data/tests). The test suite depends onspaCy.```bashpip install -r requirements.txtpython -m pytest spacy_lookups_data```If you've installed the package in your spaCy environment, you can also run thetests like this:```bashpython -m pytest --pyargs spacy_lookups_data```</longdescription>
