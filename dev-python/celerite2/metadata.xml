	<longdescription># celerite2_celerite_ is an algorithm for fast and scalable Gaussian Process (GP)Regression in one dimension and this library, _celerite2_ is a re-write of theoriginal [celerite project](https://celerite.readthedocs.io) to improvenumerical stability and integration with various machine learning frameworks.  Documentationfor this version can be found [here](https://celerite2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).This new implementation includes interfaces in Python and C++, with full support forTheano/PyMC3 and JAX.This documentation won't teach you the fundamentals of GP modeling but the bestresource for learning about this is available for free online: [Rasmussen &amp;Williams (2006)](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/). Similarly, the_celerite_ algorithm is restricted to a specific class of covariance functions(see [the original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09710) for more informationand [a recent generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05799) for extensionsto structured two-dimensional data). If you need scalable GPs with more generalcovariance functions, [GPyTorch](https://gpytorch.ai/) might be a good choice.</longdescription>
