By default, JSON5 Identifiers in object keys are returned as a `JsonIdentifier` object,which is a subclass of `str` (meaning it's compatible anywhere `str` is accepted).This helps keep keys the same round-trip, rather than converting unquoted identifiers into strings:```python&gt;&gt;&gt; text = '{bacon: &quot;eggs&quot;}'&gt;&gt;&gt; json5.dumps(json5.loads(text)) == textTrue```You can change this behavior with the `parse_json5_identifiers` argument with a callable that receives the `JsonIdentifier` objectand its return value is used instead. For example, you can specify `parse_json5_identifiers=str` to convert identifiersto strings.```python&gt;&gt;&gt; json5.dumps(json5.loads(text, parse_json5_identifiers=str))'{&quot;bacon&quot;: &quot;eggs&quot;}'```## Custom loaders; Abstract JSON5 Models**Note:** the underlying model API and tokens are not stable and are subject to breaking changes, even in minor releases.json-five also features an API for representing JSON5 as an abstract model. This enables a wide degree of capabilities forvarious use-cases, such as linters, formatters, custom serialization/deserialization, and more.Example: a simple model```pythonfrom json5.loader import loads, ModelLoaderjson_string = &quot;&quot;&quot;{foo: &quot;bar&quot;}&quot;&quot;&quot;model = loads(json_string, loader=ModelLoader())```The resulting model object looks something like this:```pythonJSONText(    value=JSONObject(        keys=[Identifier(name=&quot;foo&quot;, raw_value=&quot;foo&quot;)],        values=[DoubleQuotedString(characters=&quot;bar&quot;, raw_value='&quot;bar&quot;')],        trailing_comma=None,    ))```It is possible to make edits to the model, which will affect the output when dumped using the model dumper. However,there is (currently) no validation to ensure your model edits won't result in invalid JSON5 when dumped.You may also implement custom loaders and dumpers to control serialization and deserialization. See the [full documentation](https://json-five.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending.html#custom-loaders-and-dumpers)for more information.## TokenizationYou can also leverage tokenization of JSON5:```pythonfrom json5.tokenizer import tokenizejson_string = &quot;&quot;&quot;{foo: &quot;bar&quot;}&quot;&quot;&quot;for tok in tokenize(json_string):    print(tok.type)```Output would be:```textLBRACENAMECOLONWHITESPACEDOUBLE_QUOTE_STRINGRBRACE```# StatusThis project currently fully supports the JSON5 spec and its interfaces for loading and dumping JSON5 is stable as of v1.0.0.There is still active development underway, particularly for the underlying abstract JSON5 model representations andability to perform edits using the abstract model.</longdescription>
