	<longdescription># pytest-emojiA pytest plugin that adds emojis to your test result report 😍## pytestpytest is a mature testing framework for Python that is developed by athriving community of volunteers. It uses plain assert statements and regularPython comparisons. Writing tests with pytest requires little to noboilerplate code and powerful features allow easy parametrization andintelligent test selection.There are hundreds of plugins available for pytest with which you can extendand customize your testing harness. Distributed under the terms of the MITlicense, pytest is free and open source software.Check out [pytest][pytest] if you haven't already and if you're not sold justyet, install this plugin. Maybe that will get you motivated to write moretests! 😁This pytest plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter][cookiecutter] along with[@hackebrot][hackebrot]'s [cookiecutter-pytest-plugin][plugin-template]template. 🍪[cookiecutter]: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter[hackebrot]: https://github.com/hackebrot[pytest]: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest[plugin-template]: https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin## Installation**pytest-emoji** is available for Python 3. 🐍You can install **pytest-emoji** via [pip][pip] from [PyPI][PyPI]:```text$ pip install pytest-emoji```This will automatically install **pytest** of version 4.2.1 or higher.[pip]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/project/pytest-emoji/## FeaturesThis plugin adds a ``--emoji`` CLI flag to pytest, which replaces the testresult indicator to emojis, both for *normal* and *verbose* mode.- ``😃 / PASSED 😃`` for passed tests- ``😰 / FAILED 😰`` for failed tests- ``😞 / XFAIL 😞`` for xfailed tests- ``😲 / XPASS 😲`` for xpassed tests- ``🙄 / SKIPPED 🙄`` for skipped tests- ``😡 / ERROR 😡`` for tests with errorsNormal mode:```text$ pytest --emoji``````texttests/test_emoji.py 😃 😰 😞 😲 🙄 😡```Verbose mode:```text$ pytest --verbose --emoji``````texttests/test_emoji.py::test_passed PASSED 😃tests/test_emoji.py::test_failed FAILED 😰tests/test_emoji.py::test_xfailed XFAIL 😞tests/test_emoji.py::test_xpassed XPASS 😲tests/test_emoji.py::test_skipped SKIPPED 🙄tests/test_emoji.py::test_error ERROR 😡```## CustomizationYou can also change the emojis, if you want. 😛Add a ``conftest.py`` to your tests folder and implement the following hooks.If you wish to use the default, omit the according hook.```pythondef pytest_emoji_passed(config):    return &quot;🍪 &quot;, &quot;PASSED 🍪 &quot;def pytest_emoji_failed(config):    return &quot;😿 &quot;, &quot;FAILED 😿 &quot;def pytest_emoji_skipped(config):    return &quot;🙈 &quot;, &quot;SKIPPED 🙈 &quot;def pytest_emoji_error(config):    return &quot;💩 &quot;, &quot;ERROR 💩 &quot;def pytest_emoji_xfailed(config):    return &quot;🤓 &quot;, &quot;XFAIL 🤓 &quot;def pytest_emoji_xpassed(config):    return &quot;😜 &quot;, &quot;XPASS 😜 &quot;```**Naming the hooks correctly is important, make sure you don't make any typos**⚠️All of these hooks receive the pytest ``config`` object, which allows you tocheck options and further customize the output. All hooks need to return atuple of ``str`` as in ``(&quot;&lt;shortletter&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;verbose-word&gt;&quot;)``.It's recommended for emoji to add an extra ``&quot; &quot;`` (blank) for better formatting.## CommunityAre you interested in contributing to **pytest-emoji**?
