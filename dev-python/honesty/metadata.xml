	<longdescription># HonestyThere's a long tail of people doing interesting/sketchy things to packages onpypi.  Most aren't malicious, but this project gives you an easy way to checkfor some of the obvious ways that packages might be tampered with.# Usage```honesty list &lt;package name&gt;honesty check &lt;package name&gt;[==version|==*] [--verbose]honesty download &lt;package name&gt;[==version|==*] [--dest=some-path/]honesty extract &lt;package name&gt;[==version|==*] [--dest=some-path/]honesty license &lt;package name&gt;[==version|==*](provisional)honesty ispep517 &lt;package name&gt;[==version|==*]honesty native &lt;package name&gt;[==version|==*]honesty age &lt;package name&gt;[==version|==*]```It will store a package cache, using the normal appdirs package to pick alocation (on Linux, this defaults to `~/.cache/honesty/pypi` but, you canoverride with `XDG_CACHE_HOME` or `HONESTY_CACHE` environment variables).If you have a local bandersnatch, specify `HONESTY_INDEX_URL` to your `/simple/`url.  It also must support `/pypi/&lt;package&gt;/json` or pass `--nouse-json` to thecommands that support it.# Exit Status of 'check'These are bit flags to make sense when there are multiple problems.  If you pass`*` for version, they are or'd together.```0   if only sdist or everything matches1   if only bdist2   (reserved for future &quot;extraction error&quot;)4   some .py from bdist not in sdist8   some .py files present with same name but different hash in sdist (common    when using versioneer or 2to3)```# LicenseHonesty is copyright [Tim Hatch](http://timhatch.com/), and licensed underthe MIT license.
