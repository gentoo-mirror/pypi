This element is **Ignis**, which provides tools for quantum hardware verification, noise characterization, and error correction.## Migration GuideAs of version 0.7.0, Qiskit Ignis has been deprecated and some of its functionality was migrated into the `qiskit-experiments` package and into `qiskit-terra`.* Ignis characterization module  * This module was partly migrated to [`qiskit-experiments`](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-experiments) and split into two different modules:  `qiskit_experiments.library.calibration`  `qiskit_experiments.library.characterization`  * `AmpCal` is now replaced by `FineAmplitude`.  * `ZZFitter` was not migrated yet.* Ignis discriminator module  * This module is in the process of migration to [`qiskit-experiments`](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-experiments)* Ignis mitigation module  * The readout mitigator will be soon added to [`qiskit-terra`](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra).  * Experiments for generating the readout mitigators will be added to [`qiskit-experiments`](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-experiments)  * For use of mitigators with `qiskit.algorithms` and the [`QuantumInstance` class](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance.html?highlight=quantuminstance#qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance)    this has been integrated into `qiskit-terra` directly with the `QuantumInstance`.* Ignis verification module  * Randomized benchmarking, Quantum Volume and State and Process Tomography were migrated to [`qiskit-experiments`](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-experiments).  * Migration of Gate-set tomography to [`qiskit-experiments`](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-experiments) is in progress.  * `topological_codes` will continue development under [NCCR-SPIN](https://github.com/NCCR-SPIN/topological_codes/blob/master/README.md), while the functionality is reintegrated into Qiskit. Some additional functionality can also be found in the offshoot project [qtcodes](https://github.com/yaleqc/qtcodes).  * Currently the Accredition and Entanglement modules have not been migrated.  The following table gives a more detailed breakdown that relates the function, as it existed in Ignis, to where it now lives after this move.| Old | New | Library || :---: | :---: | :---: || qiskit.ignis.characterization.calibrations | qiskit_experiments.library.calibration | qiskit-experiments || qiskit.ignis.characterization.coherence | qiskit_experiments.library.characterization | qiskit-experiments || qiskit.ignis.mitigation | qiskit_terra.mitigation | qiskit-terra || qiskit.ignis.verification.quantum_volume | qiskit_experiments.library.quantum_volume | qiskit-experiments || qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking | qiskit_experiments.library.randomized_benchmarking | qiskit-experiments || qiskit.ignis.verification.tomography | qiskit_experiments.library.tomography | qiskit-experiments |## InstallationWe encourage installing Qiskit via the pip tool (a python package manager). The following command installs the core Qiskit components, including Ignis.```bashpip install qiskit```Pip will handle all dependencies automatically for us and you will always install the latest (and well-tested) version.To install from source, follow the instructions in the [contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).### Extra RequirementsSome functionality has extra optional requirements. If you're going to use anyvisualization functions for fitters you'll need to install matplotlib. Youcan do this with `pip install matplotlib` or when you install ignis with`pip install qiskit-ignis[visualization]`. If you're going to use a cvx fitterfor running tomogography you'll need to install cvxpy. You can do this with`pip install cvxpy` or when you install ignis with`pip install qiskit-ignis[cvx]`. When performing expectation value measurementerror mitigation using the CTMP method performance can be improved usingjust-in-time compiling if Numbda is installed. You can do this with`pip install numba` or when you install ignis with`pip install qiskit-ignis[jit]`. For using the discriminator classes in`qiskit.ignis.measurement` scikit-learn needs to be installed. You can do this with`pip install scikit-learn` or when you install ignis with`pip install qiskit-ignis[iq]`. If you want to install all extra requirementswhen you install ignis you can run `pip install qiskit-ignis[visualization,cvx,jit,iq]`.## Creating your first quantum experiment with Qiskit IgnisNow that you have Qiskit Ignis installed, you can start creating experiments, to reveal information about the device quality. Here is a basic example:```$ python``````python# Import Qiskit classesimport qiskitfrom qiskit import QuantumRegister, QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegisterfrom qiskit.providers.aer import noise # import AER noise model# Measurement error mitigation functionsfrom qiskit.ignis.mitigation.measurement import (complete_meas_cal,                                                 CompleteMeasFitter,                                                  MeasurementFilter)# Generate a noise model for the qubitsnoise_model = noise.NoiseModel()for qi in range(5):    read_err = noise.errors.readout_error.ReadoutError([[0.75, 0.25],[0.1, 0.9]])    noise_model.add_readout_error(read_err, [qi])# Generate the measurement calibration circuits# for running measurement error mitigationqr = QuantumRegister(5)meas_cals, state_labels = complete_meas_cal(qubit_list=[2,3,4], qr=qr)# Execute the calibration circuitsbackend = qiskit.Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')job = qiskit.execute(meas_cals, backend=backend, shots=1000, noise_model=noise_model)cal_results = job.result()# Make a calibration matrixmeas_fitter = CompleteMeasFitter(cal_results, state_labels)# Make a 3Q GHZ statecr = ClassicalRegister(3)ghz = QuantumCircuit(qr, cr)ghz.h(qr[2])ghz.cx(qr[2], qr[3])ghz.cx(qr[3], qr[4])ghz.measure(qr[2],cr[0])ghz.measure(qr[3],cr[1])ghz.measure(qr[4],cr[2])# Execute the GHZ circuit (with the same noise model)job = qiskit.execute(ghz, backend=backend, shots=1000, noise_model=noise_model)results = job.result()# Results without mitigationraw_counts = results.get_counts()print(&quot;Results without mitigation:&quot;, raw_counts)# Create a measurement filter from the calibration matrixmeas_filter = meas_fitter.filter# Apply the filter to the raw counts to mitigate # the measurement errorsmitigated_counts = meas_filter.apply(raw_counts)print(&quot;Results with mitigation:&quot;, {l:int(mitigated_counts[l]) for l in mitigated_counts})``````Results without mitigation: {'000': 181, '001': 83, '010': 59, '011': 65, '100': 101, '101': 48, '110': 72, '111': 391}Results with mitigation: {'000': 421, '001': 2, '011': 1, '100': 53, '110': 13, '111': 510}```## Contribution GuidelinesIf you'd like to contribute to Qiskit Ignis, please take a look at our[contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
