	<longdescription># Cryptography318Cryptography318 is a package intended to provide utility for important cryptographic andlinear algebra functions in Python. This package includes functions for generating primes, primality tests including AKS, Miller-Rabin, Baillie-PSW, functions for factoring integers includingPollard's P-1, Self-Initializing Quadratic Sieve, Pollard's Rho, and Lenstra's ECM factorization algorithm using both Montgomery curves over projective space and short Weierstrass curves, functions for solving discrete logarithm problems including Pollard's Rho method for logarithms, baby-step-giant-step, and Pohlig-Hellman, support for working with elliptic curve cryptography including 'fast power algorithm' and baby-step-giant-step, general algebra functions such as Chinese Remainder and the Euclidean Extended Algorithm for gcd's. In development is the index calculus methodfor solving DLP's.## Required Packages* numpy* sympy## Install```angular2html$ pip install cryptography318```### License[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)</longdescription>
