	<longdescription>Rainbow Saddle==============.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/flupke/rainbow-saddle.svg    :target: https://travis-ci.org/flupke/rainbow-saddlerainbow-saddle is a wrapper around `Gunicorn &lt;http://gunicorn.org/&gt;`_ tosimplify code reloading without dropping requests.Installation------------Install from pypi::    $ sudo pip install rainbow-saddleOr from source::    $ sudo ./setup.py installWhy?----Sometimes doing a ``kill -HUP &lt;gunicorn PID&gt;`` is not sufficient to reload yourcode. For example it doesn't work well `if you host your code behind a symlink&lt;https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/issues/394&gt;`_, or if a `.pth in yourinstallation is updated to point to a different directory&lt;https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/issues/402&gt;`_.The correct way to reload code in such situations is a bit complicated::    # Reexec a new master with new workers    /bin/kill -s USR2 `cat &quot;$PID&quot;`    # Graceful stop old workers    /bin/kill -s WINCH `cat &quot;$PIDOLD&quot;`    # Graceful stop old master     /bin/kill -s QUIT `cat &quot;$PIDOLD&quot;`It also has the downside of changing the &quot;master&quot; process PID, which confusestools such as supervisord.rainbow-saddle handles all of this for you, and never changes its PID.Reloading code becomes as simple as sending a ``SIGHUP`` again::    $ rainbow-saddle --pid /tmp/mysite.pid gunicorn_paster development.ini --log-level debug     $ kill -HUP `cat /tmp/mysite.pid`News====0.4.0-----Support new binary upgrade method used by Gunicorn, since version 19.6.0. Dropssupport for all previous versions of Gunicorn. See commitbenoitc/gunicorn@418f140 for more info, thanks to Jacob Magnusson.0.3.1-----Minor Python3 compatibility fix, thanks to Justin Locsei.0.3.0-----Thanks to Rafael Floriano da Silva for the following:* add --gunicorn-pidfile* fix race condition for slow starting apps* update psutil</longdescription>
