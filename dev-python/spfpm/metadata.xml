	<longdescription>The Simple Python Fixed Point Module (SPFPM) is a pure-Python module which provides basic facilities for manipulating binary fixed-point numbers of essentially arbitrary precision. It aims to be more suitable for simulating digital fixed-point artihmetic within electronic hardware (e.g. for digital signal processing (DSP) applications) than the Decimal package, which is more concerned with fixed-point arithmetic in base-10. SPFPM supports basic arithmetic operations as well as a range of mathematical functions including sqrt, exp, sin, cos, atan etc.</longdescription>
