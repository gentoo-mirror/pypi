It may not be pretty.However, then you can configure pytest with arguments something like this:    --approvaltests-add-reporter-args='diff' --approvaltests-add-reporter='/Users/emily/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/PyCharm-P/ch-0/192.6262.63/PyCharm.app/Contents/MacOS/pycharm'In PyCharm, you can create a new 'run configuration' (see the [documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-and-editing-run-debug-configurations.html)).Add a configuration using the '+' button, choose &quot;python tests | pytest&quot;.Add these arguments to set the reporter for pytest under 'Additional Arguments'.Contributing------------Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with `tox`_, please ensurethe coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.License-------Distributed under the terms of the `MIT`_ license, &quot;pytest-approvaltests&quot; is free and open source softwareIssues------If you encounter any problems, please `file an issue`_ along with a detailed description.Developer Notes----------------To release a new version on pypi:    python setup.py installcheck it created an egg file under dist    python -m twine upload dist/pytest_approvaltests-&lt;version&gt;-py3.7.eggYou will need to enter a valid username and password for pypi.. _`Cookiecutter`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`@hackebrot`: https://github.com/hackebrot.. _`MIT`: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.. _`BSD-3`: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.. _`GNU GPL v3.0`: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt.. _`Apache Software License 2.0`: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.. _`cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin.. _`file an issue`: https://github.com/emilybache/pytest-approvaltests/issues.. _`pytest`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest.. _`tox`: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.. _`pip`: https://pypi.org/project/pip/.. _`PyPI`: https://pypi.org/project</longdescription>
