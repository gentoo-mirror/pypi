	<longdescription># Django Dump Load UTF-8Django provides great database management, however, the `dumpdata` and `loaddata` commands do not use `utf-8` encoding.Thus, many data are not able to dump and load.Feel sorry that I'm not able to provide Django a patch, for the contribution guide is too long to read. If anyone hastime, please help me to merge it to Django.## Installation```shellpip install django-dump-load-utf8```## Usage### Add to `INSTALLED_APPS````python# settings.pyINSTALLED_APPS = [    '...',    'django_dump_load_utf8',    '...',]```### Use as a `manage.py` command```shellmanage.py dumpdatautf8 --output data.json# In another databasemanage.py loaddatautf8 data.json```## AboutIf this is useful, please give me a star!If you have time, please help me merge this to django!The project currently only supports python 3.8+, if you have time, please make it more competitive.</longdescription>
