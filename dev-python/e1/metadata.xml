	<longdescription># e1.pyPython support for the e1 seismic compression format.&quot;e1&quot; is a variable-length compression algorithm for int32 data.## Installation```pythonpip install e1```## Usage### Decompress data from a file```pythonimport e1file_name = 'some_file.w'byte_offset = 0nsamples = 1000with open(file_name, 'rb') as f:    f.seek(byte_offset)    data = e1.decompress_file(f, nsamples)```### Decompress raw bytes```pythonwith open(file_name, 'rb') as f:    # Read 5 times as many bytes as you expecte from nsamples x 4-byte values,    # just to make sure all your nsamples are in it.  Though it may be more data    # than you need, this gaurds against poorly-compressed data.      # In e1, you don't know a priori how many bytes it took to compress your data.    nbytes = 5 * nsamples * 4    byts = f.read(nbytes)data = decompress(byts, nsamples)```</longdescription>
