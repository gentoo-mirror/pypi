The terms 'different' and 'identical' require a little more clarification.Given two ranked lists:    A = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;]    B = [&quot;e&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;]We can see that both of them rank 5 items (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;e&quot;), but with completely opposite order. In this case the similarity between `A` and `B` should be larger than 0 (as they contain the same items, namely, conjoint), but smaller than 1 (as the order of the items are different). If there is third ranked list    C = [&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;]which ranks 5 totally different items, then if we ask for the similarity between `A` and `C`, we should expect a value of 0. In such a non-conjoint case, we need to be able to calculate a similarity as well.The RBO measure can handle ranked lists with different lengths as well, with proper extrapolation. For example, the RBO between the list `A` and list    D = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;]will be 1.## Usage### Installation using pipTo install the RBO module to the current interpreter with Pip:    pip install rbo### Computing RBOThe `RankingSimilarity` class contains the calculation for the different flavours of RBO, with clear reference to the corresponding equations in the paper.Below shows how to compute the similarity of two ranked lists S and T:```pythonIn [1]: import rboIn [2]: S = [1, 2, 3]In [3]: T = [1, 3, 2]In [4]: rbo.RankingSimilarity(S, T).rbo()Out[4]: 0.8333333333333334```Accepted data types are Python lists and Numpy arrays.Using Pandas series is possible using the underlying Numpy array as shown below. This restriction is necessary, because using `[]` on a Pandas series queries the index, which might not number items contiguously, or might even be non-numeric.```pythonIn [1]: import pandas as pdIn [2]: import rboIn [3]: S = [1, 2, 3]In [4]: U = pd.Series([1, 3, 2])In [5]: rbo.RankingSimilarity(S, U.values).rbo()Out[5]: 0.8333333333333334```### Computing extrapolated RBOThere is an extension of the vanilla RBO implementation, in which we extrapolate from the visible lists, and assume that the degree of agreement seen up to depth $k$ is continued indefinitely.This extrapolated version is implemented as the `RankingSimilarity.rbo_ext()` method.# DevelopmentRefer to the Makefile for supplementary tasks to development, e.g., executing unit tests, or checking for proper packaging.Please let [me][contact] know if there is any issue.[contact]: mailto:changyao.chen@gmail.com[paper]: http://w.codalism.com/research/papers/wmz10_tois.pdf</longdescription>
