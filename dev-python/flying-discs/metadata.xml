The repository includes non-physical and physical model based algorithms and parameterizations for calculating the trajectories.### ü§î Why create this project?This project can be used by researchers, sports enthusiasts, and anyone interested in studying or improving the performance of flying sports discs. The open-source nature of this project also allows for contributions and enhancements by the community, further improving its capabilities and usefulness.## üî¨ Included disc models#### V.
