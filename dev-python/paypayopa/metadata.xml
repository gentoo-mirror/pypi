PayPay's Payment SDK is the simplest way to achieve the integration. With PayPay's Payment SDK, you can build a custom Payment checkout process to suit your unique business needs and branding guidelines.# When to use QR Code PaymentsQR Code flow is recommended normally in the following scenarios- Payment to happen on a Tablet- Payments on Vending Machines- Payment to happen on a TV Screen- Printing a QR Code for Bill Payment## Understanding the Payment FlowFollowing diagram defines the flow for Dynamic QR Code.![](https://www.paypay.ne.jp/opa/doc/v1.0/imgs/dynamicqrcode-sequence.png)We recommend that the merchant implements a Polling of the Get payment Details API with a 4-5 second interval in order to know the status of the transaction.## Let's get StartedOnce you have understood the payment flow, before we start the integration make sure you have:- [Registered](https://developer.paypay.ne.jp/) for a PayPay developer/merchant Account- Get the API key and secret from the Developer Panel.- Use the sandbox API Keys to test out the integration### Install pip package```sh$ pip install paypayopa```## Getting StartedYou need to setup your key and secret using the following:To work in production mode you need to specify your production API_KEY &amp; API_SECRET along with a production_mode True boolean flag```pyimport paypayopaclient = paypayopa.Client(auth=(API_KEY, API_SECRET),                         production_mode=True)client.set_assume_merchant(&quot;MERCHANT_ID&quot;)```orTo work in sandbox mode you need to specify your sandbox API_KEY &amp; API_SECRET keys along with a False boolean flag or you could just omit the production_mode flag since it defaults to False if not specified```pyimport paypayopaclient = paypayopa.Client(auth=(API_KEY, API_SECRET),                         production_mode=False)```After setting up the client instance you can get the current PayPay SDK version using the following: ```pyprint(client.get_version())```### Create a QR CodeIn order to receive payments using this flow, first of all you will need to create a QR Code. Following are the important parameters that you can provide for this method:| Field  | Required  |Type   | Description  |  |---|---|---|---||merchantPaymentId   |  Yes |string &lt;= 64 characters  |The unique payment transaction id provided by merchant   || amount  |Yes   |integer &lt;= 11 characters  |Amount the user has to Pay   ||codeType   |  Yes |string &lt;= 64 characters  |Please pass the fixed value &quot;ORDER_QR&quot;||orderDescription   |No   |string &lt;= 255 characters|Description of the Order, [Click here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_S4syfMkLDplMVib7ai-L-3oHoIBRmuT6jrCoiANvqQ/edit?usp=sharing) to check how it will show up   ||isAuthorization   |No   |boolean|By default it will be false, please set true if the amount will be captured later (preauth and capture payment) |For details of all the request and response parameters , check our [API Documentation guide](https://www.paypay.ne.jp/opa/doc/v1.0/dynamicqrcode#operation/createQRCode)```pyrequest = {    &quot;merchantPaymentId&quot;: &quot;cb31bcc0-3b6c-46e0-9002-e5c4bb1e3d5f&quot;,    &quot;codeType&quot;: &quot;ORDER_QR&quot;,    &quot;redirectUrl&quot;: &quot;http://foobar.com&quot;,    &quot;redirectType&quot;:&quot;WEB_LINK&quot;,    &quot;orderDescription&quot;:&quot;Example - Mune Cake shop&quot;,    &quot;orderItems&quot;: [{        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Moon cake&quot;,        &quot;category&quot;: &quot;pasteries&quot;,        &quot;quantity&quot;: 1,        &quot;productId&quot;: &quot;67678&quot;,        &quot;unitPrice&quot;: {            &quot;amount&quot;: 1,            &quot;currency&quot;: &quot;JPY&quot;,        },    }],    &quot;amount&quot;: {        &quot;amount&quot;: 1,        &quot;currency&quot;: &quot;JPY&quot;,    },}client.Code.create_qr_code(request)```Did you get a **HTTP 201** response, if yes then you are all set for the next step.&lt;hr&gt;### Get Payment DetailsNow that you have created a Code, the next  step is to implement polling to get Payment Details.

With this information, you can decide what error handling strategy to use. In general, PayPay returns the following http status codes.#### HTTP 2xx**200**Everything works as expected.**201**The requested resource(e.g. dynamic QR code) was created.**202**Means the request is received, and will be processed sometime later.#### HTTP 4xx**400**This status code indicates an error because the information provided in request is not able to be processed. The following OPA error code may be returned.- INVALID_PARAMSThe information provided by the request contains invalid data. E.g. unsupported currency.- UNACCEPTABLE_OPThe requested operation is not able to be processed due to the current condition. E.g. the transaction limit exceeded.- NO_SUFFICIENT_FUNDThere is no sufficient fund for the transaction.**401**This status code indicates an authorization error. The following OPA error code may be returned.- UNAUTHORIZEDNo valid api key and secret provided.- OP_OUT_OF_SCOPEThe operation is not permitted.**404**This status code indicates that the requested resource is not existing in the system.**429**This status code indicates that the client sent too many requests in a specific period of time, and hit the rate limits. You should slow down the request sending or contact us to rise your limit.#### HTTP 5xx**500**This status code indicates that something went wrong on the PayPay side. A few OPA error code could be returned.- TRANSACTION_FAILEDThis code means the transaction is failed on the PayPay side. You can create new transactions for the same purpose with reasonable backoff time.- INTERNAL_SERVER_ERRORThis code means that something goes wrong, but we don't know exactly if the transaction has happened or not. It should be treated as unknown payment status.**502,503,504**Treated as unknown payment status.#### TimeoutThe recommended timeout setting is specified in each API. The most important one is for the payment creation api, where the read timeout should not be less than 30 seconds. When timeout happens, it should be treated as unknown payment status.#### Handle unknown payment statusThere are two ways to react with this situation:- Use the query api to query the transaction status. If the original transaction was failed or not found in PayPay, you can start a new transaction for the same purpose.- Or, you can cancel the transaction, if the cancel api is provided. After the cancellation is accepted, you can start a new transaction for the same purpose.### Response code list**Common response code**| Status  | CodeId  |Code   | Message  |  |---|---|---|---||200|08100001|SUCCESS|Success||202|08100001|REQUEST_ACCEPTED|Request accepted||400|08100006|INVALID_REQUEST_PARAMS|Invalid request params||401|08100023|OP_OUT_OF_SCOPE|The operation is not permitted||400|08100024|MISSING_REQUEST_PARAMS|||401|08100016|UNAUTHORIZED|Unauthorized request||404|08100007|OPA_CLIENT_NOT_FOUND|OPA Client not found||429|08100998|RATE_LIMIT|Too many requests||500|08100026|SERVICE_ERROR|||500|08101000|INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR|Something went wrong on PayPay service side||503|08100999|MAINTENANCE_MODE|Sorry, we are down for scheduled maintenance|**Create a QRCode**|Status|CodeId|Code|Message||---|---|---|---||400|01652073|DUPLICATE_DYNAMIC_QR_REQUEST|Duplicate Dynamic QR request error||400|00400060|PRE_AUTH_CAPTURE_UNSUPPORTED_MERCHANT|Merchant do not support| Pre-Auth-Capture|400|00400061|PRE_AUTH_CAPTURE_INVALID_EXPIRY_DATE|Provided Expiry Date is above the allowed limit of Max allowed expiry days||400|01650000|DYNAMIC_QR_BAD_REQUEST|Dynamic QR bad request error|**Get payment details**|Status|CodeId|Code|Message||---|---|---|---||400|01652075|DYNAMIC_QR_PAYMENT_NOT_FOUND|Dynamic QR payment not found||400|01650000|DYNAMIC_QR_BAD_REQUEST|Dynamic QR bad request error|**Delete a QRCode**|Status|CodeId|Code|Message||---|---|---|---||400|01652074|DYNAMIC_QR_ALREADY_PAID|Dynamic QR already paid||400|01650000|DYNAMIC_QR_BAD_REQUEST|Dynamic QR bad request error||404|01652072|DYNAMIC_QR_NOT_FOUND|Dynamic qr code not found|**Cancel a Payment**|Status|CodeId|Code|Message||---|---|---|---||400|00200044|ORDER_NOT_REVERSIBLE|Order cannot be reversed||500|00200034|INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR|Request timed out|**Refund a payment**|Status|CodeId|Code|Message||---|---|---|---||400|00200004|INVALID_PARAMS|Invalid parameters received||400|00200013|UNACCEPTABLE_OP|Order cannot be refunded||400|00200014|UNACCEPTABLE_OP|Multiple refund not allowed||400|00200015|INVALID_PARAMS|Invalid refund amount||400|01103027|CANCELED_USER|Canceled user||404|00200001|RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND|Order not found||500|00200002|TRANSACTION_FAILED|Transaction failed||500|00200003|TRANSACTION_FAILED|Transaction failed||500|00800017|TRANSACTION_FAILED|Balance exceeded||500|00200034|INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR|Request timed out|**Fetch refund status and details**|Status|CodeId|Code|Message||---|---|---|---||404|00200018|NO_SUCH_REFUND_ORDER|Refund not found||500|00200034|INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR|Request timed out|**Capture a payment authorization**|Status|CodeId|Code|Message||---|---|---|---||202|08300103|USER_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED|User confirmation required as requested amount is above allowed limit||400|00400035|UNACCEPTABLE_OP|Total transaction limit exceeds merchant limit||400|00200039|ALREADY_CAPTURED|Cannot capture already captured acquiring order||400|01103027|CANCELED_USER|Canceled user||400|00400062|HIGHER_CAPTURE_NOT_PERMITTED|Merchant not allowed to capture higher amount||400|00200043|ORDER_EXPIRED|Order cannot be captured or updated as it has already expired||400|00200035|ORDER_NOT_CAPTURABLE|Order is not capturable||400|00200038|REAUTHORIZATION_IN_PROGRESS|Order is being reauthorized||400|00400064|TOO_CLOSE_TO_EXPIRY|Order cannot be reauthorized as request is too close to expiry time|**Revert a payment authorization**|Status|CodeId|Code|Message||---|---|---|---||400|00200042|ORDER_NOT_CANCELABLE|Order is not cancelable|## License[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fpaypay%2Fpaypayopa-sdk-python.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fpaypay%2Fpaypayopa-sdk-python?ref=badge_large)</longdescription>
