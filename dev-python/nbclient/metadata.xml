As minor Pythonversions are officially sunset by the Python org, nbclient will similarlydrop support in the future.## OriginsThis library used to be part of the [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project. NBClient extracted nbconvert's `ExecutePreprocessor`into its own library for easier updating and importing by downstream libraries and applications.## Relationship to JupyterClientNBClient and JupyterClient are distinct projects.`jupyter_client` is a client library for the jupyter protocol. Specifically, `jupyter_client` provides the Python APIfor starting, managing and communicating with Jupyter kernels.While, nbclient allows notebooks to be run in different execution contexts.## About the Jupyter Development TeamThe Jupyter Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Jupyter project.This includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:https://github.com/jupyter/.## Our Copyright PolicyJupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyrightover their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that thesecontributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupytersource code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person orinstitution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire JupyterDevelopment Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain a record of whatchanges/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicatetheir copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit thechange to one of the Jupyter repositories.With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code fileto indicate the copyright and license terms:```# Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team.# Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.```</longdescription>
