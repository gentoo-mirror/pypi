For older versions, please check [previous releases](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-python/releases).**Appwrite is an open-source backend as a service server that abstract and simplify complex and repetitive development tasks behind a very simple to use REST API. Appwrite aims to help you develop your apps faster and in a more secure way. Use the Python SDK to integrate your app with the Appwrite server to easily start interacting with all of Appwrite backend APIs and tools. For full API documentation and tutorials go to [https://appwrite.io/docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)![Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/images/github.png)## InstallationTo install via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):```bashpip install appwrite```## Getting Started### Init your SDKInitialize your SDK with your Appwrite server API endpoint and project ID which can be found on your project settings page and your new API secret Key from project's API keys section.```pythonfrom appwrite.client import Clientfrom appwrite.services.users import Usersclient = Client()(client  .set_endpoint('https://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1') # Your API Endpoint  .set_project('5df5acd0d48c2') # Your project ID  .set_key('919c2d18fb5d4...a2ae413da83346ad2') # Your secret API key  .set_self_signed() # Use only on dev mode with a self-signed SSL cert)```### Make Your First RequestOnce your SDK object is set, create any of the Appwrite service objects and choose any request to send. Full documentation for any service method you would like to use can be found in your SDK documentation or in the [API References](https://appwrite.io/docs) section.```pythonusers = Users(client)result = users.create('[USER_ID]', 'email@example.com', 'password')```### Full Example```pythonfrom appwrite.client import Clientfrom appwrite.services.users import Usersfrom appwrite.id import IDclient = Client()(client  .set_endpoint('https://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1') # Your API Endpoint  .set_project('5df5acd0d48c2') # Your project ID  .set_key('919c2d18fb5d4...a2ae413da83346ad2') # Your secret API key  .set_self_signed() # Use only on dev mode with a self-signed SSL cert)users = Users(client)result = users.create(ID.unique(), 'email@example.com', 'password')```### Error HandlingThe Appwrite Python SDK raises `AppwriteException` object with `message`, `code` and `response` properties. You can handle any errors by catching `AppwriteException` and present the `message` to the user or handle it yourself based on the provided error information. Below is an example.```pythonusers = Users(client)try:  result = users.create(ID.unique(), 'email@example.com', 'password')except AppwriteException as e:  print(e.message)```### Learn moreYou can use the following resources to learn more and get help- ðŸš€ [Getting Started Tutorial](https://appwrite.io/docs/getting-started-for-server)- ðŸ“œ [Appwrite Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)- ðŸ’¬ [Discord Community](https://appwrite.io/discord)- ðŸš‚ [Appwrite Python Playground](https://github.com/appwrite/playground-for-python)## ContributionThis library is auto-generated by Appwrite custom [SDK Generator](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-generator).
