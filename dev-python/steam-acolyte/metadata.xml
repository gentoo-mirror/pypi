	<longdescription>Steam Acolyte=============Steam account switcher - lightweight program to switch between steam accountswithout having to reenter password/2FA.|Screenshot|- works on **windows** and **linux**- one click to login the corresponding user- works on the first start using your existing login- waits in the background while steam is running- close steam and directly login another user via the tray menu- automatically shows a list of users previously logged in on this machine  by reading steam config files- has buttons to delete saved logins and/or remove users from the list- never comes in contact with any of your passwords- includes a simple command line interfaceInstallation------------Install the latest version from PyPI::    pip install --user steam-acolyte**Alternatively**, if you want this application to live independently from other python packages,I recommend using pipx_ rather than *pip*::    pip install --user pipx    pipx install steam-acolyte.. _pipx: https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/**For windows**, an all-inclusive ``.exe`` file can be created usingPyInstaller_ from the development files as follows::    pip install -U pyinstaller    pyinstaller steam-acolyte.specThis ``.exe`` can also be downloaded from the `github releases`_ page. Expectthat on the first execution windows shows a warning dialog along the lines of&quot;Windows Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting.Running this app might put your PC at risk&quot;. Click &quot;More info&quot; and then &quot;Runanyway&quot; to acknowledge the warning. This is normal because I didn't buy a codesigning certificate... _pyinstaller: http://www.pyinstaller.org/.. _github releases: https://github.com/coldfix/steam-acolyte/releasesUsage-----Simply run ``steam-acolyte`` instead of ``steam``.In order to switch users, exit steam via the &quot;Exit&quot; option, or use acolyte'stray menu.Optionally, modify your steam launchers to execute ``steam-acolyte``.How it works------------*acolyte* does not inspect or store any password or login tokens at all. Itonly tells steam which user to login when starting. Steam uses its ownmechanism to store login information. This has the following consequences:- the login token can be used to login without having to re-enter 2FA  (whereas for password-based login manager you would need to redo 2FA)- you can mix using steam with or without acolyte- active logins expire if unused for a several weeks- selecting &quot;Change Account&quot; from the steam menu or &quot;Log Out User&quot; in Big  Picture mode UI invalidates the login and you will have to reenter your  password for the logged out user.. |Screenshot| image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coldfix/steam-acolyte/master/screenshot.png   :target:             https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coldfix/steam-acolyte/master/screenshot.png   :alt:                Screenshot (usernames were changed)CHANGES-------0.9.0~~~~~Date: 25.05.2023- no longer modify/replace config.vdf (see #28)- remove obsolete &quot;logout&quot; button- the files in ``steam/acolyte/*/config.vdf`` that were created by  previous versions of the program no longer have any purposes0.8.1~~~~~Date: 09.10.2022- new build to trigger PyPI/AUR deployment…  It turns out, using ``schedule:`` in a GitHub Actions seems to prevent  it from being run on push (or at least that seems to be the case after  it has been disabled due to inactivity…)0.8.0~~~~~Date: 09.10.2022- add command line option ``--prefix`` to better support flatpack steam- try to autodetect whether to use the default, native, or the flatpack  version of steam (unreliable)0.7.9~~~~~Date: 31.05.2022- new build to trigger deployment after fixing AUR deployment0.7.8~~~~~Date: 31.05.2022- fix UnicodeDecodeError on systems with a preferred encoding different from  UTF-8 (#13)0.7.7~~~~~Date: 27.04.2021- fix exception due to case-sensitive handling of steam config files (#10)0.7.6~~~~~Date: 30.01.2021- add workaround for trayicon not showing in plasma (#8)- AUR package: fix incorrect usage of Version entry in desktop file- AUR package: install desktop icon to /usr/share/pixmaps- AUR package: rename desktop app to &quot;Steam Acolyte&quot;0.7.5~~~~~- package: fix unexpanded version in desktop file in AUR package0.7.4~~~~~- package: fix bug in AUR package0.7.3~~~~~- package: add .desktop entry to AUR package0.7.2~~~~~- bugfix: another deadlock when stopping or restarting steam0.7.1~~~~~- bugfix: exception when clicking &quot;Exit Steam&quot; menu item- bugfix: possible crash at program exit when closing via menu0.7.0~~~~~- bugfix: failing to restart steam, waiting indefinitely- add ``--logfile`` option to redirect steam output- add ``--verbose`` option to print debug messages- require pyinstaller 3.6- some internal code improvements0.6.3~~~~~- maintenance release with no code changes: fixup AUR version format0.6.2~~~~~- maintenance release with no code changes: automate AUR package update0.6.1~~~~~- built windows exe against newest pyqt- migrate builds to github actions0.6.0~~~~~- add menu item for shutting down steam- add menu items for direct user switching without showing the GUI0.5.0~~~~~- add CLI option --exe for setting steam executable0.4.5~~~~~- fix exception that occurs if loginusers doesn't exist on startup or is empty0.4.4~~~~~- fix tooltips being shown in unreadable colors- fix exception if loginusers doesn't exist on startup0.4.3~~~~~- use python's builtin importlib.resources if available0.4.2~~~~~- fix FileNotFoundError from acolyte.lock0.4.1~~~~~- align context menu with tray icon0.4.0~~~~~- store current login on program start- show a tray icon to inform users when acolyte is running- fix an issue where the mouse hover effects stop working after hiding and  showing the window- trigger buttons when mouse is released, not already when pressed.
