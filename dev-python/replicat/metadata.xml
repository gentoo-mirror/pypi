Your files are transfered andstored in an optionally encrypted and chunked form, and references to *chunks* (i.e. their hashdigests) are stored in *snapshots* along with file name and metadata. You can create, list,and delete snapshots, and, of course, restore original files from snapshots.Replicat supports two types of repositories: **encrypted** (the default) and **unencrypted**.You may want to disable encryption if you trust your backend provider and network, for example.Chunks, snapshots, and all other pieces of data inside **unencrypted** repositories are storedunencrypted.In case of **encrypted** repositories, Replicat will use symmetric encryption to encrypt chunksand snapshots. In order to use encryption, you will need to choose a password and generate the keyassociated with that password (Replicat can do it for you). You'll need both the password and thematching key to unlock the repository, but how or where you're going to store them is up to you.Actually, you can create multiple keys with different passwords and maybe share those withother people. If you ask Replicat to create a &quot;shared&quot; key, it will copy some of the secretsfrom your key to the new key, so that you and the owner of the new key could use deduplicationfeatures *together*, meaning data uploaded by you could be reused (referenced and decrypted)by the other person. That other person will also be able to create &quot;shared&quot; keys by copyingsecrets that were originally copied to their key from your key, and so on. This creates a web oftrust of sorts. If any of this is not desirable, you can create &quot;independent&quot; keys.Names of files, file timestamps, and other file metadata within snapshots are encrypted usinga secret that never gets copied to other keys. That is, if you create a snapshot, owners of sharedkeys will be able to see it, but there will be no available information about it beyond its storagename and the table of chunk references (still, they might still be able to check whether you haveever uploaded a specific piece of data - that's what enables shared deduplication).No data will be accessible if a snapshot was created using an independent key.&lt;details&gt;    &lt;summary&gt;        &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;High-level technical details&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;/summary&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is a JSON object that contains parameters for the KDF, which will be used to deriveuser key from the password, and a private encrypted section, which can only be decryptedby the owner of the key and the matching password (i.e., it's encrypted and decrypted usingthe previously derived user key). The encrypted section contains secrets for the cryptographicprimitives that control how the data is split into chunks, visibility of chunks of data, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The storage names for chunks and snapshots in unencrypted repositories are simply the hashdigests of their contents. For encrypted repositories, the storage name for the chunk is derivedfrom the hash digest of its contents &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; one of the aforementioned secrets, in order to reducethe chance of successful &quot;confirmation of file&quot; attacks. The chunk itself is encrypted withthe combination of the hash digest of its contents &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; another one of those secrets, sincethe usual convergent encryption is vulnerable to that same &quot;confirmation of file&quot; attack. Note thatthat these secrets get copied to shared keys in order to support shared deduplication. Tableof chunk references in a snapshot also gets encrypted in a way that lets owners of shared keys todecrypt it. This helps Replicat to identify which chunks are still referenced by snapshots andwhich can be garbage collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;details&gt;    &lt;summary&gt;        &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Extremely cool, colorful, in-depth diagrams that I worked really hard on&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;/summary&gt;Glossary: - **`Encrypt(data, key)`/`Decrypt(data, key)`** - encrypts/decrypts `data` with the encryption key `key` using an authenticated encryption algorithm. It's normally used to encrypt/decrypt private sections in keys, as well as chunks and snapshots. - **`Hash(data)`** - computes the hash digest of `data` using a hashing algorithm. It's used to check integrity of data and to derive encryption keys for chunks and snapshots. - **`Mac(data, key)`** - computes the message authentication code for `data` using suitable `key` and a MAC algorithm. It's mainly used to verify ownership of chunks. - **`SlowKdf(ikm, salt[, context])`/`FastKdf(ikm, salt[, context])`** - calls a &quot;slow&quot;/&quot;fast&quot; key derivation function to obtain an encryption key from `ikm` using `salt` and an optional `context`. As a general rule, replicat uses &quot;slow&quot; KDF for low-entropy inputs and &quot;fast&quot; KDF for high-entropy inputs. The output length will match the encryption key length of the chosen encryption algorithm. - **`UserKey`** - encryption key derived as `SlowKdf(Password, UserKdfParams)`, where `Password` is the user's password and `UserKdfParams` is the salt. `UserKey` is used to encrypt sensitive personal data: private sections in keys and file metadata in snapshots. - **`SharedKey`**, **`SharedKdfParams`**, **`SharedMacKey`**, **`SharedChunkerKey`** - secrets stored in the private sections of keys. `SharedKey` and `SharedKdfParams` are used to derive encryption keys using &quot;fast&quot; KDF (they will encrypt shared data, like chunks and chunk references). `SharedMacKey` is the MAC key. `SharedChunkerKey` personalises content-defined chunking (CDC) to prevent watermarking attacks. - **`GetChunkLocation(name, authentication_tag)`/`GetSnapshotLocation(name, authentication_tag)`** - obtains the location for a chunk/snapshot using its name and the corresponding authentication tag.  - **`Upload(data, location)`** - uploads `data` to the backend to the given `location`. - **`Download(location)`** - downloads data from the backend at the given `location`. ![replicat config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4944562/172485084-e2935819-0287-442c-a71c-b2098ef12077.svg)![replicat keys](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4944562/172485551-789c608b-5dfd-4846-94e7-7d88a96f19db.svg)![replicat chunks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4944562/172485100-f4dc189f-6736-4914-8fe9-51960771f122.svg)![replicat snapshots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4944562/172485108-b4d66ee8-d00d-4593-a95a-c84eef53af3e.svg)&lt;/details&gt;# Command line interfaceThe installer will create the `replicat` command (same as `python -m replicat`).There are several available subcommands: - `init` - initialises the repository using the provided settings - `snapshot` - creates a new snapshot in the repository - `list-snapshots`/`ls` - lists snapshots - `list-files`/`lf` - lists files across snapshots - `restore` - restores files from snapshots - `add-key` - creates a new key for the encrypted repository - `delete` - deletes snapshots by their names - `clean` - performs garbage collection - `upload-objects` - uploads objects to the backend (a low-level command) - `download-objects` - downloads objects from the backend (a low-level command) - `list-objects` - lists objects at the backend (a low-level command) - `delete-objects` - deletes objects from the backend (a low-level command)&gt; ⚠️ **WARNING**: commands that read from or upload to the repository can safely be run&gt; concurrently; however, there are presently no guards in place that would make it safe&gt; for you to run destructive actions (`delete`, `clean`) concurrently with those actions&gt; *unless* you use independent keys (see the explanation above). I do plan to implement them&gt; soon-ish, but in the meantime **DO NOT** use shared keys (or, naturally, the same key)&gt; to `snapshot` and `clean` at the same time, for example.&gt;&gt; As far as the upcoming implementation of such guards, it'll be based on locks. I'm familiar&gt; with the lock-free deduplication strategy (like in Duplicacy), but I don't like it much.There are several command line arguments that are common to all subcommands: - `-r`/`--repository` - used to specify the type and location of the repository backend (backup destination). The format is `&lt;backend&gt;:&lt;connection string&gt;`, where `&lt;backend&gt;` is the short name of a Replicat-compatible backend and `&lt;connection string&gt;` is open to interpretation by the adapter for the selected backend. Examples: `b2:bucket-name` for the B2 backend or `local:some/local/path` for the local backend (or just `some/local/path`, since the `&lt;backend&gt;:` part can be omitted for local destinations). If the backend requires additional arguments, they will appear in the `--help` output. Refer to the section on backends for more detailed information. - `-q`/`--hide-progress` - suppresses progress indication for commands that support it - `-c`/`--concurrent` - the number of concurrent connections to the backend - `--cache-directory` - specifies the directory to use for cache. `--no-cache` disables cache completely. - `-v`/`--verbose` - increases the logging verbosity. The default verbosity is `warning`, `-v` means `info`, `-vv` means `debug`.Encrypted repositories require a key and a matching password for every operation: - `-K`/`--key-file` - the path to the key file - `-p`/`--password` - the password in plaintext. **However**, it's more secure to provide the password in a file via the `-P`/`--password-file` argument, or as an environment variable `REPLICAT_PASSWORD`.If the backend requires additional parameters (account name, client secret, some boolean flag, orliterally anything else), you'll also be able to set them via command line arguments orin the configuration file. Refer to [_Backends_ section](#backends) section to learn more.If you often use many of these arguments, and their values mostly stay the same betweeninvocations, you may find it easier to put them in a configuration file instead.There are three arguments related to that: - `--profile` - load settings from this profile in the configuration file - `--config` - path to the configuration file (check `--help` for the default config location) - `--ignore-config` - ignore the configuration fileNote that values from CLI always take precedence over options from the configuration file.Specifically, to build the final configuration, Replicat considers command line arguments, environmentvariables, the configuration file (either the default one *or* the one supplied via `--config`),and global defaults, in that order.Names of configuration file options mostly match the long names of command line arguments(e.g., `hide-progress = true` matches `--hide-progress`, `repository = &quot;s3:bucket&quot;` matches`-r s3:bucket`), but you can always refer to the[_Configuration file_ section](#configuration-file) for full reference.## `init` examples```bash# Unencrypted repository 'some:repository'. The --encryption none flag disables encryption$ replicat init -r some:repository --encryption none# Encrypted repository with initial password taken from string.# The new key will be printed to stdout$ replicat init -r some:repository -p 'password string'# Encrypted repository with initial password taken from a file.# The new key will be written to 'path/to/key/file'$ replicat init -r some:repository -P path/to/password/file -o path/to/key/file# Specifies the cipher$ replicat init -r some:repository -p '...' --encryption.cipher.name chacha20_poly1305# Specifies settings for the cipher and the hash algorithm$ replicat init -r some:repository \    -p '...' \    --encryption.cipher.name aes_gcm \    --encryption.cipher.key_bits 128 \    --hashing.name sha2 \    --hashing.bits 256# Specifies the KDF name and parameters (for the key)$ replicat init -r some:repository \    -p '...' \    --encryption.kdf.name scrypt \    --encryption.kdf.n 2097152# Specifies the chunking parameters$ replicat init -r some:repository \    -p '...' \    --chunking.min-length 128_000 \    --chunking.max-length 2_048_000# Equivalent (dashes in argument names are converted to underscores)$ replicat init -r some:repository \    -p '...' \    --chunking.min_length 128_000 \    --chunking.max_length 2_048_000```The main takeaway here is that you can disable encryption simply by setting `--encryption none`.Check the [_Custom settings_ section](#custom-settings) for more.## `snapshot` examples```bash# Unlocks the repository, uploads provided files in encrypted chunks,# using no more than 10 concurrent connections, creating a snapshot$ replicat snapshot -r some:repository \    -P path/to/password/file \    -K path/to/key/file \    -c 10 \    -n 'A note (optional)'    image.jpg some-directory another-directory and/more.text# Uploads one file in chunks using 5 concurrent connections, while restricting# the bandswith to 512 KB per second.

For example, if you seea backend-specific argument `--some-backend-option` in the `--help` output, the equivalentconfiguration file option will be called `some-backend-option`.Here's an example configuration file (it uses TOML syntax)```tomlconcurrent = 10# Relative paths workcache-directory = &quot;~/.cache/directory/for/replicat&quot;[debugging]log-level = &quot;info&quot;hide-progress = true[my-local-repo]repository = &quot;some/local/path&quot;password = &quot;&lt;secret&gt;&quot;key = &quot;&quot;&quot;{    &quot;kdf&quot;: { ... },    &quot;kdf_params&quot;: { &quot;!b&quot;: &quot;...&quot; },    &quot;private&quot;: { &quot;!b&quot;: &quot;...&quot; }}&quot;&quot;&quot;concurrent = 15no-cache = true[some-s3-repo]repository = &quot;s3:bucket-name&quot;key-id = &quot;...&quot;access-key = &quot;...&quot;region = &quot;...&quot;```Options that you specify at the top of the configuration file are defaults and they will beinherited by all of the profiles. In the example above there are three profiles(not including the default one): `debugging`, `my-local-repo`, `some-s3-repo`. You can tellReplicat which profile to use via the `--profile` CLI argument.Notice that `some-s3-repo` includes options that were not listed in the table. `key-id`,`access-key`, `region` are the aforementioned backend-specific options for the S3 backend.See [_Backends_](#backends).# BackendsRun `replicat` commands with `-r &lt;backend&gt;:&lt;connection string&gt;` and additional argumentsthat are specific to the selected backend. Those arguments may have defaults and may alsobe provided via environment variables or profiles. Use```bashreplicat &lt;command&gt; -r &lt;backend&gt;:&lt;connection string&gt; --help```to see them.## LocalThe format is `-r local:some/local/path` or simply `-r some/local/path`.## B2The format is `-r b2:bucket-id` or `-r b2:bucket-name`. This backend uses B2 native API andrequires - key ID (`--key-id` argument, or `B2_KEY_ID` environment variable, or `key-id` option in a profile) - application key (`--application-key` argument, or `B2_APPLICATION_KEY` environment variable, or `application-key` option in a profile)Sign into your Backblaze B2 account to generate them. Note that you can use the master applicationkey or a normal (non-master) application key (which can also be restricted to a single bucket).Refer to [official B2 docs](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/application_keys.html) for moreinformation.## S3The format is `-r s3:bucket-name`. Requires - AWS key ID (`--key-id` argument, or `S3_KEY_ID` environment variable, or the `key-id` option in a profile) - AWS access key (`--access-key` argument, or `S3_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable, or `access-key` option in a profile) - region (`--region` argument, or `S3_REGION` environment variable, or `region` option in a profile)## S3-compatibleThe format is `-r s3c:bucket-name`. Requires - key ID (`--key-id` argument, or `S3C_KEY_ID` environment variable, or the `key-id` option in a profile) - access key (`--access-key` argument, or `S3C_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable, or `access-key` option in a profile) - host (`--host` argument, or `S3C_HOST` environment variable, or `host` option in a profile) - region (`--region` argument, or `S3C_REGION` environment variable, or `region` option in a profile)Host must *not* include the scheme. The default scheme is `https`, but can be changed via the`--scheme` argument (or, equivalently, the `S3C_SCHEME` environment variable or `scheme` optionin a profile).You can use S3-compatible backend to connect to [B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/s3_compatible_api.html),S3, and many other cloud storage providers that offer S3-compatible API.# Custom backends`replicat.backends` is a namespace package, making it possible to add custom backendswithout changing `replicat` source code.Suppose your backend of choice is a hypothetical low low cost cloud storageProud Cloud (`pc` for short). The most barebones implementation of theReplicat-compatible adapter for the `pc` backend will require a directory withthe following structure:```bash$ tree proud-cloud/proud-cloud/└── replicat    └── backends        └── pc.py```The `-r` argument of `replicat` commands will take the form of `-r pc:&lt;connection string&gt;`.Replicat will use it to locate the `pc` module inside the `replicat.backends` package,load the `replicat.backends.pc.Client` class, and pass the `&lt;connection string&gt;`to its constructor to create the backend instance. In case there are some additionalparameters that are required to connect to Proud Cloud (account id, secret token, etc.),you should add them to the `replicat.backends.pc.Client` constructor as keyword-only arguments.If present, Replicat will generate the corresponding command line arguments with defaults *and*you'll even be able to use environment variables or profiles to provide them.`replicat.backends.pc.Client` must subclass `replicat.backends.base.Backend` and implement allof the methods marked as abstract. You could use implementations of existing`replicat.backends.base.Backend` subclasses as examples. To make your implementation visibleto Replicat, you'll need to add it to the module search path before invoking `replicat`(you could use the[`PYTHONPATH`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH) environmentvariable for that).Here's an example:```python# ./proud-cloud/replicat/backends/pc.pyfrom .base import Backendclass ProudCloud(Backend):    def __init__(self, connection_string, *, account_id, secret, port=9_876, legacy=False):        print(f'PC args: {connection_string=}, {account_id=}, {secret=}, {port=}, {legacy=}')        ...    ...Client = ProudCloud``````bash$ PYTHONPATH=proud-cloud replicat init -r pc:... --helpusage: replicat init [-h] [-r REPO] [-q] [-c CONCURRENT] [-v] [-K KEYFILE]                     [-p PASSWORD | -P PASSWORD_FILE_PATH] [--account-id ACCOUNT_ID]                     [--secret SECRET] [--port PORT] [--legacy LEGACY] [-o KEY_OUTPUT_FILE]optional arguments:  ...arguments specific to the ProudCloud backend:  --account-id ACCOUNT_ID                        or the PROUDCLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID environment variable  --secret SECRET       or the PROUDCLOUD_SECRET environment variable  --port PORT           or the PROUDCLOUD_PORT environment variable, or the constructor default 9876  --legacy LEGACY       or the PROUDCLOUD_LEGACY environment variable, or the constructor default False``````bash$ PYTHONPATH=proud-cloud PROUDCLOUD_LEGACY=true PROUDCLOUD_SECRET='pr0ud' \    replicat init -r pc:... \    --account-id 12345 \    --port 9877PC args: connection_string='...', account_id=12345, secret='pr0ud', port=9877, legacy=True...```If you've created a Replicat-compatible adapter for a backend that Replicat doesn't alreadysupport *and* your implementation doesn't depend on additional third-party libraries(or at least they are not too heavy and can be moved to extras), consider submitting a PRto include it in this repository.# Custom settingsReplicat's default parameters and selection of cryptographic primitives should work well formost users but they do allow for some customisation if you know what you are doing.Supported primitives and their parameters:|         Name         |    Use    |  Parameters (with defaults)  |     Description    | Notes ||----------------------|-----------|------------------------------|--------------------|-------|| `aes_gcm`            | AEAD      | `key_bits` (256 [bits]), `nonce_bits` (96 [bits]) | AES in GCM mode | Supports 128, 192, and 256 bit keys || `chacha20_poly1305`  | AEAD      |                              | ChaCha20&amp;#8209;Poly1305 ||| `scrypt`             | Key derivation | `n` (2 ^ 20), `r` (8), `p` (1) | Scrypt KDF | Preferred for low-entropy inputs || `blake2b`            | Hash, HMAC, key derivation | `length` (64 [bytes])        | BLAKE2b | BLAKE2b-based &quot;KDF&quot; should only be used for high-entropy inputs || `sha2`               | Hash      | `bits` (512 [bits])          | SHA2 | Supported digest sizes are 224, 256, 384, and 512 bits  || `sha3`               | Hash      | `bits` (512 [bits])          | SHA3 | Supported digest sizes are 224, 256, 384, and 512 bits  || `gclmulchunker`      | CDC       | `min_length` (128K [bytes]), `max_length` (5.12M [bytes]) | Content-defined chunking algorithm based on carry-less multiplication (CLMUL) |Encryption algorithm, hash algorithm, chunker, as well as their parameters are set for the entirerepository and so apply to all users of the repository. By default, Replicat uses AES256-GCMfor encryption, Scrypt (`n` is 2 ^ 20, `r` is 8, `p` is 1) as the KDF for the user's encryptionkey, BLAKE2b (as hash, &quot;KDF&quot;, and HMAC), and GCLMULChunker as the chunker, which produces chunksbetween 128K and 5.12M in size with default parameters. KDF for the user's encryption key andKDF params can vary from key to key, though.## Repository settingsRepository-wide settings are stored in the file called `config` that gets uploaded to the rootof the repository when you initialise it. Here's the default `config`:```json{    &quot;hashing&quot;: {        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;blake2b&quot;,        &quot;length&quot;: 64    },    &quot;chunking&quot;: {        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;gclmulchunker&quot;,        &quot;min_length&quot;: 128000,        &quot;max_length&quot;: 5120000    },    &quot;encryption&quot;: {        &quot;cipher&quot;: {            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;aes_gcm&quot;,            &quot;key_bits&quot;: 256,            &quot;nonce_bits&quot;: 96        }    }}```Coincidentally, this hierarchy is how you're expected to provide your custom repositorysettings via CLI -- only in a flat representation.For example, to disable encryption for the repository, you'd pass `--encryption none` tothe `init` command. If instead you wish to reduce AES-GCM key size from the default256 bits to 128 bits, all you need to do is pass `--encryption.cipher.key_bits 128`(or, equivalently, `--encryption.cipher.key-bits 128`) during initialisation.To change the cipher from the default AES256-GCM to ChaCha20&amp;#8209;Poly1305, you'd use`--encryption.cipher.name chacha20_poly1305`. Note that when you set the `name` attributelike that, Replicat will load the default parameters for the new algorithm and also checkif your settings are valid. It would be an error to provide any parametersfor `chacha20_poly1305`, say.Changing `config` after the repository has already been initialised may renderexisting data inaccessible.## Key settingsYou may specify the KDF and its params whenever you create a new key, so either via `init`or via `add-key`. Similar to repository-wide settings, you'd use a flat hierarchical formatfor that. For example, in order to increase the work factor for Scrypt (the default KDF),you could pass `--encryption.kdf.n 2097152` (next power of two after 1048576) to the command,or you could tweak Scrypt's `r` parameter the same way.It's also possible to change the parameters for the existing key by cloning it viathe `add-key` command. Simply set the `--clone` flag and provide the new KDF settingsas shown in the previous paragraph.# SecurityIf you believe you've found a security issue with Replicat, please report it to[flwaultah@gmail.com](mailto:flwaultah@gmail.com) (or DM me on Twitter or Telegram).</longdescription>
