	<longdescription># idnumbersWelcome to the idnumbers project! Our goal is to provide a python3 library for verifying and parsing national IDnumbers. This library can be used to quickly and easily validate and extract information from ID numbers issued byvarious countries. It is an open source project, so feel free to use and contribute to it.* [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/idnumbers.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/idnumbers)* [![PyPI Stats](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/idnumbers)](https://pypistats.org/packages/idnumbers)# FeaturesThe idnumbers library offers the following features:* Verification of national ID numbers: This feature allows you to check if a given ID number is valid and has been  issued by the respective country.* Parsing of national ID numbers: This feature allows you to extract useful information from an ID number such as the  date of birth, gender, and more.* Support for multiple countries: The library currently supports several countries, with more being added in the future.* Easy to use and well-documented API: The library has a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy to use and  well-documented for developers to understand.* Lightweight and efficient: The library is lightweight, meaning it does not have many dependencies, and it is  efficient, meaning it does not consume much memory or processing power.# InstallationInstalling idnumbers is easy! You can use pip, the package installer for Python, to install the latest version of thelibrary. Simply open a terminal and run the following command:It is highly recommended to install the library in a virtual environment, this will prevent conflicts with other pythonpackages in your system. You can create a virtual environment using virtualenv or conda.For virtualenv:```shellvirtualenv &lt;envname&gt;source &lt;envname&gt;/bin/activate```For Anaconda:```shellconda create --name &lt;envname&gt;conda activate &lt;envname&gt;```Once you have activated your virtual environment, you can install idnumbers by running the following command:```shellpip install idnumbers```This will install the latest version of idnumbers and its dependencies.You can also install a specific version of idnumbers by specifying the version number in the command, like this:```shellpip install idnumbers==&lt;version&gt;```Alternatively, you can install from source by cloning the git repository and installing it via```shellgit clone https://github.com/Identique/idnumbers.gitcd idnumberspip install .```Please make sure you have the latest version of pip and setuptools installed before proceeding with the installation.Once you have finished using the library, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:```shelldeactivate```or```shellconda deactivate```# Usage## Verify National IDsThe idnumbers library makes it easy to verify national ID numbers. Here are some examples of how to use the library forverifying ID numbers.```pythonfrom idnumbers.nationalid import AUS, NGA, ZAF# Verify AUS tax file number (with checksum code)taxfile_number = '32547689'is_valid = AUS.TaxFileNumber.validate(taxfile_number)if is_valid:    print(f'{taxfile_number} is a valid AUS Tax File Number')else:    print(f'{taxfile_number} is an invalid AUS Tax File Number')# Verify AUS driver license numberdriver_license = '12 345 678'is_valid = AUS.DriverLicenseNumber.validate(driver_license)if is_valid:    print(f'{driver_license} is a valid AUS Driver License Number')else:    print(f'{driver_license} is an invalid AUS Driver License Number')# Verify AUS Medicare number (with checksum code)medicare_number = '2123 45670 1'is_valid = AUS.MedicareNumber.validate(medicare_number)if is_valid:    print(f'{medicare_number} is a valid AUS Medicare Number')else:    print(f'{medicare_number} is an invalid AUS Medicare Number')# Verify NGA national id numbernga_nationalid = '12345678901'is_valid = NGA.NationalID.validate(nga_nationalid)if is_valid:    print(f'{nga_nationalid} is a valid Nigerian National ID Number')else:    print(f'{nga_nationalid} is an invalid Nigerian National ID Number')# Verify ZAF nation id numberzaf_nationalid = '7605300675088'is_valid = ZAF.NationalID.validate(zaf_nationalid)if is_valid:    print(f'{zaf_nationalid} is a valid South African ID Number')else:    print(f'{zaf_nationalid} is an invalid South African ID Number')```These examples show how to use the idnumbers library to verify different types of national ID numbers for differentcountries. The `validate` method returns a boolean value indicating if the ID number is valid or not. All modules undernationalid package support the `validate` function.You can also use the library to validate different types of ID numbers for different countries.It is important to keep in mind that the library is only able to validate the format and the checksum of the ID number,not if it is an actual issued ID number.## Parse National IDsThe idnumbers library supports the parse function for certain national ID numbers, which allows you to easily extractdetailed information from the ID number. The parse function is only available for national IDs for which theMETADATA.parsable field is set to True.For example, the South African ID Number, Nigerian National ID Number and Australian Medicare Number all support theparse function. By using the parse method, you can extract information such as the date of birth, gender, andcitizenship from these ID numbers.Here is an example of how to use the parse function for a South African ID number:```pythonfrom idnumbers.nationalid import ZAF# Parse the national ID numberid_number = '7605300675088'id_data = ZAF.NationalID.parse(id_number)# Access the date of birthprint(f'Date of birth: {id_data[&quot;yyyymmdd&quot;]}')# Access the genderprint(f'Gender: {id_data[&quot;gender&quot;]}')# Access the citizenshipprint(f'Citizenship: {id_data[&quot;citizenship&quot;]}')```This example shows how to use the parse method of the ZAF.NationalID class to extract the date of birth, gender andcitizenship from a South African ID number. The parse method returns a dictionary with various fields,including `yyyymmdd` for date of birth, `gender` for gender and `citizenship` for citizenship.Similarly, you can parse the Nigerian National ID Number and Australian Medicare Number by using theNGA.NationalID.parse() and AUS.MedicareNumber.parse() respectively.Please note that the returned parsed data may vary depending on the country and id type you are using. Also, it isimportant to keep in mind that the library is only able to validate the format and the checksum of the ID number, not ifit is an actual issued ID number.# Supported CountriesHere's the list of the countries we haveimplemented [Country List](https://identique.github.io/idnumbers/idnumbers/nationalid.html)# Metadata Structure of each IDHere's the metadata definitions and how to use it in idnumbers: [METADATA](https://github.com/identique/idnumbers/blob/main/docs/nationalid/METADATA.md)# ContributionThe idnumbers project is an open-source project and contributions from the community are always welcome.
