Thankfully the designers have provided an excellent and complete REST interface. This library wraps up that interface as more conventional python objects in order to make many Jenkins oriented tasks easier to automate.This library allows you to automate most common Jenkins operations using Python, such as:* Ability to add/remove/query Jenkins jobs* Ability to execute jobs and:    * Query the results of a completed build    * Block until jobs are complete or run jobs asyncronously    * Get objects representing the latest builds of a job* Work with build artifacts:    * Search for artifacts by simple criteria    * Install artifacts to custom-specified directory structures* Ability to search for builds by source code revision* Ability to add/remove/query:    * Slaves (Webstart and SSH slaves)    * Views (including nested views using NestedViews Jenkins plugin)    * Credentials (username/password and ssh key)* Username/password auth support for jenkins instances with auth turned on* Ability to script jenkins installation including pluginsFor a full documentation spec of what this library supports see: http://jenkinsapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.htmlPython versions---------------The project has been tested against Python versions:* 2.7* 3.4* 3.5* 3.6* 3.7Jenkins versions----------------Project tested on both stable (LTS) and latest Jenkins versions.Known issues------------* Job deletion operations fail unless Cross-Site scripting protection is disabled.For other issues, please refer to the support URL below.Important Links---------------Support and bug-reports: https://github.com/pycontribs/jenkinsapi/issues?direction=desc&amp;sort=comments&amp;state=openProject source code: github: https://github.com/pycontribs/jenkinsapiProject documentation: https://jenkinsapi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Releases: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jenkinsapiInstallation-------------Egg-files for this project are hosted on PyPi. Most Python users should be able to use pip or setuptools to automatically install this project.Using Pip or Setuptools^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Most users can do the following:.. code-block:: bashpip install jenkinsapiOr:.. code-block:: basheasy_install jenkinsapiBoth of these techniques can be combined with virtualenv to create an application-specific installation.Using your operating-system's package manager^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Ubuntu users can now use apt to install this package:.. code-block:: bash    apt-get install python-jenkinsapiBeware that this technique will get a somewhat older version of Jenkinsapi.Example-------JenkinsAPI is intended to map the objects in Jenkins (e.g. Builds, Views, Jobs) into easily managed Python objects:.. code-block:: python&gt;&gt;&gt; import jenkinsapi&gt;&gt;&gt; from jenkinsapi.jenkins import Jenkins&gt;&gt;&gt; J = Jenkins('http://localhost:8080')&gt;&gt;&gt; J.version1.542&gt;&gt;&gt; J.keys() # Jenkins objects appear to be dict-like, mapping keys (job-names) to['foo', 'test_jenkinsapi']&gt;&gt;&gt; J['test_jenkinsapi']&lt;jenkinsapi.job.Job test_jenkinsapi&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; J['test_jenkinsapi'].get_last_good_build()&lt;jenkinsapi.build.Build test_jenkinsapi #77&gt;...More examples available on Github: https://github.com/pycontribs/jenkinsapi/tree/master/examplesTesting-------If you have installed the test dependencies on your system already, you can runthe testsuite with the following command:.. code-block:: bash    python setup.py testOtherwise using a virtualenv is recommended. Setuptools will automatically fetchmissing test dependencies:.. code-block:: bash    virtualenv    source .venv/bin/active    (venv) python setup.py testDevelopment-----------* Make sure that you have Java_ installed.* Create virtual environment for development* Install package in development mode.. code-block:: bash    (venv) pip install -e .    (venv) pip install -r test-requirements.txt* Make your changes, write tests and check your code.. code-block:: bash    (venv) toxProject Contributors--------------------* Aleksey Maksimov (ctpeko3a@gmail.com)* Salim Fadhley (sal@stodge.org)* Ramon van Alteren (ramon@vanalteren.nl)* Ruslan Lutsenko (ruslan.lutcenko@gmail.com)* Cleber J Santos (cleber@simplesconsultoria.com.br)* William Zhang (jollychang@douban.com)* Victor Garcia (bravejolie@gmail.com)* Bradley Harris (bradley@ninelb.com)* Kyle Rockman (kyle.rockman@mac.com)* Sascha Peilicke (saschpe@gmx.de)* David Johansen (david@makewhat.is)* Misha Behersky (bmwant@gmail.com)Please do not contact these contributors directly for support questions!
