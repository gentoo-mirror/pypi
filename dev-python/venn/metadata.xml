	<longdescription># pyvenn: Venn diagrams for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 setsPlease refer to the Jupyter notebook for demos and a brief explanation of theinterface; a more complete documentation is in the works as the project keepsevolving:  https://github.com/LankyCyril/pyvenn/blob/master/pyvenn-demo.ipynbThis library is an evolution of tctianchi's pyvenn package (see fork URL).  Their liberal license (Unlicense) allowed me to fork the repository,change the license to GPLv3, modify the package's interface and, hopefully,significantly contribute to and improve the library, and make it installablefrom PyPI.The main methods in this version are different from the ones in tctianchi'simplementation, but the original methods are still provided for backwardscompatibility, and I would like to emphasize the importance of tctianchi's workthat allowed for this library to exist (among other things, figuring out thecoordinates best fit for plotting the diagrams' shapes and petals' labels).This iteration of the library implements two main functions:* `venn(dataset_dict, **kwargs)` which plots true Venn diagrams for any numberof sets between 2 and 5 using ellipses, and for 6 sets using triangles* `pseudovenn(dataset_dict, **kwargs)` which plots a Venn-like intersection ofsix circles (not all intersections are present in such a plot, but many are).</longdescription>
