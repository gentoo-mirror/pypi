It has been unsupported by the Python core team for a while now, its PyPI downloads are negligible, and our CI provider removed it as a supported option.  It's very unlikely that ``service-identity`` will break under 3.4 anytime soon, which is why we do *not* block its installation on Python 3.4.  But we don't test it anymore and will block it once someone reports breakage.Deprecations:^^^^^^^^^^^^^*none*Changes:^^^^^^^^- ``service_identity.exceptions.VerificationError`` can now be pickled and is overall more well-behaved as an exception.  This raises the requirement of ``attrs`` to 19.1.0.`Full changelog &lt;https://service-identity.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html&gt;`_.Authors=======``service-identity`` is written and maintained by `Hynek Schlawack &lt;https://hynek.me/&gt;`_.The development is kindly supported by `Variomedia AG &lt;https://www.variomedia.de/&gt;`_.Other contributors can be found in `GitHub's overview &lt;https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/graphs/contributors&gt;`_.</longdescription>
