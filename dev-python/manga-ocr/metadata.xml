	<longdescription># Manga OCROptical character recognition for Japanese text, with the main focus being Japanese manga.It uses a custom end-to-end model built with Transformers' [Vision Encoder Decoder](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/vision-encoder-decoder) framework. Manga OCR can be used as a general purpose printed Japanese OCR, but its main goal was to provide a high qualitytext recognition, robust against various scenarios specific to manga:- both vertical and horizontal text- text with furigana- text overlaid on images- wide variety of fonts and font styles- low quality imagesUnlike many OCR models, Manga OCR supports recognizing multi-line text in a single forward pass,so that text bubbles found in manga can be processed at once, without splitting them into lines.See also:- [Poricom](https://github.com/bluaxees/Poricom), a GUI reader, which uses manga-ocr- [mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro), a tool, which uses manga-ocr to generate an HTML overlay for manga- [Xelieu's guide](https://rentry.co/lazyXel), a comprehensive guide on setting up a reading and mining workflow with manga-ocr/mokuro (and many other useful tips)- Development code, including code for training and synthetic data generation: [link](manga_ocr_dev)- Description of synthetic data generation pipeline + examples of generated images: [link](manga_ocr_dev/synthetic_data_generator)</longdescription>
