See `the documentation &lt;https://icclim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanation/climate_indices.html#icclim-capabilities&gt;`_ to explore what other index you can compute with icclim... code-block:: python    import icclim    summer_days = icclim.su(        &quot;netcdf_files/tasmax_1990-2100.nc&quot;, out_file=&quot;summer_days.nc&quot;    )For more examples on how to use icclim, see icclim's `How to ... &lt;https://icclim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/index.html&gt;`_ documentation or`our notebooks &lt;https://gitlab.com/is-enes-cdi-c4i/notebooks/-/tree/master/&gt;`_.Who use icclim--------------icclim is part of `C4I platform &lt;https://dev.climate4impact.eu&gt;`_ backend and is integrated in `CLIPC Portal &lt;http://www.clipc.eu&gt;`_.icclim is also used by some independent researchers.Who made icclim---------------icclim has always been an open source project and was successfully made thanks to the joint effort of all its contributors.The lead development is made at `CERFACS &lt;https://cerfacs.fr/en/&gt;`_, a research institution located in Toulouse, France.Grants~~~~~~This open-source project has been possible thanks to funding by the European Commission projects:* FP7-CLIPC (2013-2016)* FP7-IS-ENES2 (2013-2017)* EUDAT2020 (2015-2018)* H2020-IS-ENES3 (2019-2023)The beautiful icclim logo is a creation of `Carole Petetin &lt;https://carolepetetin.com&gt;`_ and has been funded by the H2020 `IS-ENES3 &lt;https://is.enes.org&gt;`_ project grant agreement No 824084 (2019-2023).Indices-------For a detailed description of each ECA&amp;D index, please visit: https://www.ecad.eu/documents/atbd.pdf..
