(don't forget to type the above lines in your shell!)```pythonimport fastrandprint(&quot;generate an integer in [0,1001)&quot;)fastrand.pcg32bounded(1001) print(&quot;Generate a random 32-bit integer.&quot;)fastrand.pcg32()```It is nearly an order of magnitude faster than the alternatives:```python -m timeit -s 'import fastrand' 'fastrand.pcg32bounded(1001)'10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0602 usec per looppython -m timeit -s 'import random' 'random.randint(0,1000)'1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.698 usec per looppython -m timeit -s 'import numpy' 'numpy.random.randint(0, 1000)'1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.795 usec per loop```If you have Linux, macOS or Windows, you should be able to do just pip install...```pip install fastrand```You may need root access (sudo on macOS and Linux).It is sometimes useful to install a specific version, you can do so as follows;```pip install fastrand==1.2.4```Generally, you can build the library as follows (if you have root):```bashpython setup.py buildpython setup.py install ```or```bashpython setup.py buildpython setup.py install --home=$HOMEexport PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/lib/python```## Changing the seed and multiple streams- You can change the seed with a function like `pcg32_seed`. The seed determines the random values you get. Be mindful that naive seeds (e.g., `int(time.time())`) can deliver poor initial randomness. A few calls to `pcg32()` may help to boost the improve the randomness. Or else you may try a better seed.- If you need to produce multiple streams of random numbers, merely changing the seed is not enough. You are better off using different increments by calling the `pcg32inc`. The increments should all be distinct. Note that the least significant bit of the increment is always set to 1 no matter which value you pass: so make sure your increments are distinct 31-bit values (ignoring the least significant bit).## future workAlso look at https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler## Reference* http://www.pcg-random.org* Daniel Lemire, [Fast Random Integer Generation in an Interval](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10941), ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation, Volume 29 Issue 1, February 2019 </longdescription>
