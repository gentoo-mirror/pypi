	<longdescription># phxutilsThis is going to be a handy little repo where I maintain some of useful scriptsthat I use on a regular basis.  I have a private repo where I have maintainedmost of these scripts for a long time, but some of them could prove useful to thegeneral public, and half the time I forget what they do and end up re-writing them.This repo will be a place for me to keep them up-to-date and document what they do.Some aren't even big enough to be called scripts and are more like bash/zsh functions,but it's easier having the commands at my fingertips by having all my tools installedinstead of finding/copy/pasting functions into my `~/.bashrc`/`~/.zshrc`.The structure includes an individual folder for each script with a `README.md` documentingwhat the script does.  Additionally, there will be a `bin` directory where I will symlinkall of the actual scripts for easy importing into your `$PATH`.This project is also maintained on PyPi for easy installation via `pip`.For more information, browse to the subfolders to view the individual README files.I will continue to add scripts to this repo as I have time and as the need for them arises.## Requirements:In order to fully-utilize all of the scripts included in `phxutils`, Linux is a pre-requisite, but many will work on MacOS (some may need to be tweaked a bit).To view individual requirements, feel free to view each package's README file.The following additional requirements are necessary:- `/bin/sh` (many scripts)- `bash` (some scripts)- `python3` (some scripts)## Simple Installation via pipInstallation is extremely simple using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/):Install from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/phxutils/):`pip3 install --user phxutils`or install latest version from GitHub:`pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/phx/phxutils`For what it's worth, most of the `phxutils` scripts use `sh` and `bash`.The only Python scripts at the time of this writing are Python3, and are executable with hashbangs pointing to `/usr/bin/env python3` and only use the standard library.This means, you won't clutter your native Python intallation by installing a bunch of third party libraries outside of virtual environments.### Upgrading via pip`pip3 install --upgrade --user phxutils`or`pip3 install --upgrade --user git+https://github.com/phx/phxutils`### Uninstall`pip3 uninstall phxutils`## Advanced InstallationTo add these programs to your `$PATH` without using `pip3`, I would do something like the following:Note: replace `.bashrc` with `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`, etc., as necessary.```mkdir -p &quot;$HOME/bin&quot;cd &quot;$HOME/bin&quot;git clone https://github.com/phx/phxutilsecho 'PHX_UTILS=&quot;$HOME/bin/phxutils/bin&quot;' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrcecho 'export PATH=&quot;$PHX_UTILS:$PATH&quot;' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrcsource ~/.bashrc```The benefits to this method are an easier upgrade.### Easy Upgrade via Advanced Install Method`cd &quot;$HOME/bin/phxutils&quot; &amp;&amp; git pull`### Uninstall`sed -i '/PHX_UTILS/d' ~/.bashrc &amp;&amp; rm -rf &quot;$HOME/bin/phxutils&quot;`Note: replace `.bashrc` with `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`, etc., as necessary in the above command.</longdescription>
