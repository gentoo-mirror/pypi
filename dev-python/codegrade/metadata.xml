	<longdescription># CodeGrade APIThis library makes it easier to use the CodeGrade API. Its API allows you toautomate your usage of CodeGrade. We are currently still busy documenting theentire API, but everything that is possible in the UI of CodeGrade is alsopossible through the API.## InstallationYou can install the library through [pypi](https://pypi.org/), simply run`python3 -m pip install codegrade`. If you want to get a dev version with supportfor the latest features, simply email [support@codegrade.com](mailto:support@codegrade.com)and we'll provide you with a dev version.## UsageFirst, create a client:```pythonimport codegrade# Don't store your password in your code!with codegrade.login(    username='my-username',    password=os.getenv('CG_PASSWORD'),    tenant='My University',) as client:    pass# Or supply information interactively.with codegrade.login_from_cli() as client:    pass```Now call your endpoint and use your models:```pythonfrom codegrade.models import PatchCourseDatacourses = client.course.get_all()for course in courses:    client.course.patch(        PatchCourseData(name=course.name + ' (NEW)'),        course_id=course.id,    )# Or, simply use dictionaries.for course in courses:    client.course.patch(        {&quot;name&quot;: course.name + ' (NEW)'},        course_id=course.id,    )```For the complete documentation go tohttps://python.api.codegrade.com.## Backwards compatibilityCodeGrade is constantly upgrading its API, but we try to minimize backwardsincompatible changes. We'll announce every backwards incompatible change in the[changelog](http://codegrade.com/changelog). A new version of the APIclient is released with every release of CodeGrade, which is approximately everymonth. To upgrade simply run `pip install --upgrade codegrade`.## Supported python versionsWe support python 3.6 and above, `pypy` is currently not tested but should workjust fine.## LicenseThe library is licensed under AGPL-3.0-only or BSD-3-Clause-Clear.</longdescription>
