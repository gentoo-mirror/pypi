Some may want to publish a simple post, others want to publish a story.All this can be achieved with `instapy-cli`. :tada:I dedided to start this repo and open-source it with :heart:### Installation&lt;!-- **Install** --&gt;```shellpip install instapy-cli```### Usage#### Use as LibraryYou can check the folder `examples` to see working codes to use instapy-cli programmatically.If you want to use instapy-cli via shell continue reading.#### Use as CLI**Use**```shellinstapy -u USR -p PSW -f FILE/LINK -t 'TEXT CAPTION'```**CLI Options**| option | required | default | description || --- | --- | --- | --- || -u | **yes** | - | username || -p | **yes** | - | password || -f | **yes** | - | file/media to upload || -t | *optional* | - | text caption for post || -s | *optional* | - | upload a story |**Help**```shellinstapy --help```#### Hints##### CookieYou can avoid to re-login, by using a cookie that instapy-cli generate for you.By default instapy-cli use the cookie created in current working directory with the name 'USERNAME_ig.json'.If you don't want to store the cookie in your filesystem you need to pass the parameter `cookie`:```pythonwith client(username, password, cookie) as cli:    # do stuffs with cli```This is feature is not well tested, be carefull using it.##### Image Formatinstapy-cli support images in the format of JPG/JPEG/PNG.##### Aspect RatioThe images need to have an aspect ratio of 1:1, that is squared size.You can use other aspect-ratio other than 1:1, but be carefull to stay inside Instagram limits.Otherwise, if you don't respect the aspect ratio, the media will be posted but stretched or cropped.### Why instapy-cli?First, long story short: instapy-cli is a fork of pynstagram, with the aim of extending its functionality and fixing all unresolved bugs.##### Move this project to a better place :arrow_right_hook:Anyone that wants to collaborate, I promise to be a good repo manager and merge all your pull requests as soon as possible.I have some ideas to improve this but I need collaboration. Join and support! :bulb:##### But, wait! Instagram doesn't allow uploading content except from the app (of course :trollface:)Short answer:&gt; Yes, you are right.Long answer:&gt; Every connection from a mobile phone could be intercepted. Someone has done the hard work to sniff the packets sent from the phone to Instagram and &quot;spread the news&quot;. You can do a quick research.## Code Requirements#### This packages will be installed automatically with *instapy-cli*| package     | Source Link || :---:       | :---: || requests    | https://github.com/requests/requests || filetype    | https://github.com/h2non/filetype.py || instagram-private-api    | https://github.com/ping/instagram_private_api || instagram-private-api-extensions    | https://github.com/ping/instagram_private_api_extensions |## ContributeTo help `instapy-cli` developers to build and maintain this project, go to **[docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)**&gt; instructions soon(Write it and collaborate! :wink:)## LicenseMIT## Support the project and the authorOffer me a coffe or a beer and support instapy-cli. :tada:Click the button here &gt;[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paypal-DONATE-blue.svg?logo=paypal)](https://paypal.me/b3nab)</longdescription>
