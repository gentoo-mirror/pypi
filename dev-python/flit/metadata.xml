	<longdescription>**Flit** is a simple way to put Python packages and modules on PyPI.It tries to require less thought about packaging and help you avoid commonmistakes.See `Why use Flit? &lt;https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rationale.html&gt;`_ formore about how it compares to other Python packaging tools.Install-------::    $ python3 -m pip install flitFlit requires Python 3 and therefore needs to be installed using the Python 3version of pip.Python 2 modules can be distributed using Flit, but need to be importable onPython 3 without errors.Usage-----Say you're writing a module ``foobar`` — either as a single file ``foobar.py``,or as a directory — and you want to distribute it.1. Make sure that foobar's docstring starts with a one-line summary of what   the module is, and that it has a ``__version__``:   .. code-block:: python       &quot;&quot;&quot;An amazing sample package!&quot;&quot;&quot;       __version__ = &quot;0.1&quot;2. Install flit if you don't already have it::       python3 -m pip install flit3. Run ``flit init`` in the directory containing the module to create a   ``pyproject.toml`` file. It will look something like this:   .. code-block:: ini       [build-system]       requires = [&quot;flit_core &gt;=3.2,&lt;4&quot;]       build-backend = &quot;flit_core.buildapi&quot;       [project]       name = &quot;foobar&quot;       authors = [{name = &quot;Sir Robin&quot;, email = &quot;robin@camelot.uk&quot;}]       dynamic = [&quot;version&quot;, &quot;description&quot;]       [project.urls]       Home = &quot;https://github.com/sirrobin/foobar&quot;   You can edit this file to add other metadata, for example to set up   command line scripts. See the   `pyproject.toml page &lt;https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html#scripts-section&gt;`_   of the documentation.   If you have already got a ``flit.ini`` file to use with older versions of   Flit, convert it to ``pyproject.toml`` by running ``python3 -m flit.tomlify``.4. Run this command to upload your code to PyPI::       flit publishOnce your package is published, people can install it using *pip* just likeany other package. In most cases, pip will download a 'wheel' package, astandard format it knows how to install. If you specifically ask pip to installan 'sdist' package, it will install and use Flit in a temporary environment.To install a package locally for development, run::    flit install [--symlink] [--python path/to/python]Flit packages a single importable module or package at a time, using the importname as the name on PyPI. All subpackages and data files within a package areincluded automatically.</longdescription>
