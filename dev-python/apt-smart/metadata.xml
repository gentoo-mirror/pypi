It's currently tested on Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5,3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and PyPy (although test coverage is still rather low, see status_)... contents::   :local:Why?--------As a successor of `apt-mirror-updater &lt;https://github.com/xolox/python-apt-mirror-updater&gt;`_,`apt-smart` has many improvements in intelligence, speed, accuracy and robustness (see changelog_) when offering the best mirror for you.It has a plan to optionally be a set-and-forget smart daemon: running in the background as a reverse proxyalways redirecting to the best mirror without root privilege. It also has a plan to support other distros like: Linux Mint (Done!) , ROS..... _features:Features--------**Smart discovery of available mirrors** Debian_ , Ubuntu_ and `Linux Mint`_ mirrors are discovered automatically by querying the `Debian mirror list &lt;https://www.debian.org/mirror/list&gt;`_ or the `Ubuntu mirror list1 &lt;http://mirrors.ubuntu.com/mirrors.txt&gt;`_  or the `Ubuntu mirror list2 &lt;https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors&gt;`_ or the `Linux Mint mirror list &lt;https://linuxmint.com/mirrors.php&gt;`_ (the applicable mirror list is automatically selected based on the current platform). It can smartly get mirrors within the country which the user is in.**Smart ranking of available mirrors** Discovered mirrors are ranked by bandwidth (to pick the fastest mirror) and whether they're up-to-date and excluded if they're being updated (see `issues with mirror updates`_). e.g. with `--list-mirrors` flag it would output like this:.. code-block:: sh    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    | Rank | Mirror URL                       | Available? | Updating? | Last updated    | Bandwidth     |    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    |    1 | http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu | Yes        | No        | Up to date      | 16.95 KB/s    |    |    2 | http://mirrors.cqu.edu.cn/ubuntu | Yes        | No        | 3 hours behind  | 427.43 KB/s   |    |    3 | http://mirrors.nju.edu.cn/ubuntu | Yes        | No        | 5 hours behind  | 643.27 KB/s   |    |    4 | http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.e...| Yes        | No        | 5 hours behind  | 440.09 KB/s   |    |    5 | http://mirrors.cn99.com/ubuntu   | Yes        | No        | 13 hours behind | 2.64 MB/s     |    |    6 | http://mirrors.huaweicloud.com...| Yes        | No        | 13 hours behind | 532.01 KB/s   |    |    7 | http://mirrors.dgut.edu.cn/ubuntu| Yes        | No        | 13 hours behind | 328.25 KB/s   |    |    8 | http://mirrors.aliyun.com/ubuntu | Yes        | No        | 23 hours behind | 1.06 MB/s     |    |    9 | http://ftp.sjtu.edu.cn/ubuntu    | Yes        | No        | 23 hours behind | 647.2 KB/s    |    |   10 | http://mirrors.yun-idc.com/ubuntu| Yes        | No        | 23 hours behind | 526.6 KB/s    |    |   11 | http://mirror.lzu.edu.cn/ubuntu  | Yes        | No        | 23 hours behind | 210.99 KB/s   |    |   12 | http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/ubuntu| Yes        | Yes       | 8 hours behind  | 455.02 KB/s   |    |   13 | http://mirrors.sohu.com/ubuntu   | No         | No        | Unknown         | 90.28 bytes/s |    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Automatic switching between mirrors** The main mirror configured in ``/etc/apt/sources.list`` can be changed with a single command. The new (to be configured) mirror can be selected automatically or configured explicitly by the user.**Robust package list updating** Several apt-get_ subcommands can fail if the current mirror is being updated (see `issues with mirror updates`_) and `apt-smart` tries to work around this by wrapping ``apt-get update`` to retry on failures and automatically switch to a different mirror when it looks like the current mirror is being updated (because I've seen such updates take more than 15 minutes and it's not always acceptable to wait for so long, especially in automated solutions)... _status:Status------On the one hand the `apt-smart` package was developed based on quite afew years of experience in using apt-get_ on Debian_ and Ubuntu_ systems. On theother hand the Python package itself is relatively new: it was developed andpublished in Sep 2019. As such:.. warning:: Until `apt-smart` has been rigorously tested I consider             it a proof of concept (beta software) so if it corrupts your             system you can't complain that you weren't warned! The worst that can happen             (assuming you trust my judgement ;-) is that             ``/etc/apt/sources.list`` is corrupted however a backup copy is             made before any changes are applied, so I don't see how this can             result in irreversible corruption.I'm working on an automated test suite but at the moment I'm still a bit fuzzyon how to create representative tests for the error handling code paths (also,writing a decent test suite requires a significant chunk of time :-).Installation------------The `apt-smart` package is available on PyPI_ which means installationshould be as simple as (paste all below commands together into terminal):.. code-block:: sh   sudo apt update   sudo apt install python-pip python-setuptools python-wheel -y  # install python-pip and so on without asking   pip install --user apt-smart  # --user flag means install to per user site-packages directory(see below)   echo &quot;export PATH=\$(python -c 'import site; print(site.USER_BASE + \&quot;/bin\&quot;)'):\$PATH&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc   source ~/.bashrc  # set per user site-packages directory to PATHThere's actually a multitude of ways to install Python packages (e.g. the `peruser site-packages directory`_, `virtual environments`_ or just installingsystem wide) and I have no intention of getting into that discussion here, soif this intimidates you then read up on your options before returning to theseinstructions ;-).If a new version of apt-smart has been released, you can upgrade it via:.. code-block:: sh  pip install --user apt-smart --upgrade**Note**. ``apt-smart`` is a *helper* for the ``apt`` tool. It is **NOT** a*replacement* for ``apt`` (or for ``apt-get``). So, ``apt-smart`` should*not* be run *instead* of either of those commands. Nor should``apt-smart`` be run with ``sudo`` or via ``su``; if ``apt-smart``happens to need root privilege in order for it to continue (in orderthat it may, for example, change ``sources.list``), then it will promptfor a password.Usage-----There are two ways to use the `apt-smart` package: As the command lineprogram ``apt-smart`` and as a Python API. For details about thePython API please refer to the API documentation available on `Read the Docs`_.The command line interface is described below... contents::   :local:.. A DRY solution to avoid duplication of the `apt-smart --help' text:....

It is assumed that the   remote account has root privileges or password-less sudo access.&quot;   &quot;``-f``, ``--find-current-mirror``&quot;,&quot;Determine the main mirror that is currently configured in   /etc/apt/sources.list and report its URL on standard output.&quot;   &quot;``-F``, ``--file-to-read=local_file_absolute_path``&quot;,&quot;Read a local absolute path (path and filename must NOT contain whitespace) file   containing custom mirror URLs (one URL per line) to add custom mirrors to rank.&quot;   &quot;``-b``, ``--find-best-mirror``&quot;,&quot;Discover available mirrors, rank them, select the best one and report its   URL on standard output.&quot;   &quot;``-l``, ``--list-mirrors``&quot;,List available (ranked) mirrors on the terminal in a human readable format.   &quot;``-L``, ``--url-char-len=int``&quot;,&quot;An integer to specify the length of chars in mirrors' URL to display when   using ``--list-mirrors``, default is 34&quot;   &quot;``-c``, ``--change-mirror=MIRROR_URL``&quot;,Update /etc/apt/sources.list to use the given ``MIRROR_URL``.   &quot;``-a``, ``--auto-change-mirror``&quot;,&quot;Discover available mirrors, rank the mirrors by connection speed and update   status and update /etc/apt/sources.list to use the best available mirror.&quot;   &quot;``-u``, ``--update``, ``--update-package-lists``&quot;,&quot;Update the package lists using &quot;&quot;apt-get update&quot;&quot;, retrying on failure and   automatically switch to a different mirror when it looks like the current   mirror is being updated.&quot;   &quot;``-U``, ``--ubuntu``&quot;,&quot;Ubuntu mode for Linux Mint to deal with upstream Ubuntu mirror instead of Linux Mint mirror.   e.g. ``--auto-change-mirror`` ``--ubuntu`` will auto-change Linux Mint's upstream Ubuntu mirror&quot;   &quot;``-x``, ``--exclude=PATTERN``&quot;,&quot;Add a pattern to the mirror selection blacklist. ``PATTERN`` is expected to be   a shell pattern (containing wild cards like &quot;&quot;?&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;\*&quot;&quot;) that is matched   against the full URL of each mirror.&quot;   &quot;``-v``, ``--verbose``&quot;,Increase logging verbosity (can be repeated).   &quot;``-V``, ``--version``&quot;,Show version number and Python version.   &quot;``-R``, ``--create-chroot=local_dir_absolute_path``&quot;,Create chroot with the best mirror in a local directory with absolute_path   &quot;``-q``, ``--quiet``&quot;,Decrease logging verbosity (can be repeated).   &quot;``-h``, ``--help``&quot;,&quot;  Show this message and exit.   Note: since apt-smart uses `urlopen` method in The Python Standard Library,         you can set Environment Variables to make apt-smart connect via HTTP proxy, e.g. in terminal type:         export {http,https,ftp}_proxy='http://user:password@myproxy.com:1080'         These will not persist however (no longer active after you close the terminal),         so you may wish to add the line to your ~/.bashrc&quot;.. [[[end]]].. _issues with mirror updates:Issues with mirror updates--------------------------The most frequent failure that we run into is ``apt-get update`` crapping outwith 'hash sum mismatch' errors (see also `Debian bug #624122`_). When thishappens a file called ``Archive-Update-in-Progress-*`` can sometimes be foundon the index page of the mirror that is being used (see also `Debian bug#110837`_). I've seen these situations last for more than 15 minutes.My working theory about these 'hash sum mismatch' errors is that they arecaused by the fact that mirror updates aren't atomic, apparently causing``apt-get update`` to download a package list whose datafiles aren't consistentwith each other. If this assumption proves to be correct (and also assumingthat different mirrors are updated at different times :-) then the command``apt-smart --update-package-lists`` should work around this annoyingfailure mode (by automatically switching to a different mirror when 'hash summismatch' errors are encountered).Publishing `apt-smart` to the world is my attempt to contribute tothis situation instead of complaining in bug trackers (see above) where norobust and automated solution is emerging (at the time of writing). Who knows,maybe some day these issues will be resolved by moving logic similar to whatI've implemented here into ``apt-get`` itself. Of course it would also help ifmirror updates were atomic...Contact-------The latest version of `apt-smart` is available on PyPI_ and GitHub_.The documentation is hosted on `Read the Docs`_ and includes a changelog_.
