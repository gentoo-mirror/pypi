Uploaded files are not loaded into memory but mounted as read-only files in a new WORKERFS.## InstallationYou can install using `pip`:```bashpip install ipyfilite```If you are using Jupyter Notebook 5.2 or earlier, you may also need to enablethe nbextension:```bashjupyter nbextension enable --py [--sys-prefix|--user|--system] ipyfilite```## Development InstallationCreate a dev environment:```bashconda create -n ipyfilite-dev -c conda-forge nodejs yarn python jupyterlabconda activate ipyfilite-dev```Install the python. This will also build the TS package.```bashpip install -e &quot;.[test, examples]&quot;```When developing your extensions, you need to manually enable your extensions with thenotebook / lab frontend. For lab, this is done by the command:```jupyter labextension develop --overwrite .yarn run build```For classic notebook, you need to run:```jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --symlink --overwrite --py ipyfilitejupyter nbextension enable --sys-prefix --py ipyfilite```Note that the `--symlink` flag doesn't work on Windows, so you will here have to runthe `install` command every time that you rebuild your extension. For certain installationsyou might also need another flag instead of `--sys-prefix`, but we won't cover the meaningof those flags here.### How to see your changes#### Typescript:If you use JupyterLab to develop then you can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in differentterminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the widget.```bash# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when neededyarn run watch# Run JupyterLab in another terminaljupyter lab```After a change wait for the build to finish and then refresh your browser and the changes should take effect.#### Python:If you make a change to the python code then you will need to restart the notebook kernel to have it take effect.## Updating the versionTo update the version, install tbump and use it to bump the version.By default it will also create a tag.```bashpip install tbumptbump &lt;new-version&gt;```## Funding`ipyfilite` has been developed as part of [ESiWACE3](https://www.esiwace.eu), the third phase of the Centre of Excellence in Simulation of Weather and Climate in Europe.Funded by the European Union. This work has received funding from the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (JU) under grant agreement No 101093054.</longdescription>
