	<longdescription># Pulumi Cert Manager ComponentThis repo contains the Pulumi Cert Manager component for Kubernetes. This add-on automates themanagement and issuance of TLS certificates from various issuing sources. It ensures certificatesare valid and up to date periodically, and attempts to renew certificates at an appropriate timebefore expiry.This component wraps [the Jetstack Cert Manager Helm Chart](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager),and offers a Pulumi-friendly and strongly-typed way to manage Cert Manager installations.For examples of usage, see [the official documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/),or refer to [the examples](/examples) in this repo.## To UseTo use this component, first install the Pulumi Package:Afterwards, import the library and instantiate it within your Pulumi program:## ConfigurationThis component supports all of the configuration options of the [official Helm chart](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/tree/master/deploy/charts/cert-manager), except that theseare strongly typed so you will get IDE support and static error checking.The Helm deployment uses reasonable defaults, including the chart name and repo URL, however,if you need to override them, you may do so using the `helmOptions` parameter. Refer to[the API docs for the `kubernetes:helm/v3:Release` Pulumi type](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/reference/pkg/kubernetes/helm/v3/release/#inputs) for a full set of choices.For complete details, refer to the Pulumi Package details within the Pulumi Registry.</longdescription>
