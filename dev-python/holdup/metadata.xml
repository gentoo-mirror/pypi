	<longdescription>========Overview========A tool to wait for services and execute command. Useful for Docker containers that depend on slow to start services(like almost everything).* Free software: BSD 2-Clause LicenseInstalllation=============Currently holdup is only published to PyPI and `hub.docker.com &lt;https://hub.docker.com/r/ionelmc/holdup&gt;`_.To install from PyPI::    pip install holdupIt has no dependencies except the optional PostgreSQL check support, which you'd install with::    pip install 'holdup[pg]'You can also install the in-development version with::    pip install https://github.com/ionelmc/python-holdup/archive/master.zipAlternate installation (Docker image)-------------------------------------Example::    docker run --rm ionelmc/holdup tcp://foobar:1234Note that this will have some limitations:* executing the ``command`` is pretty pointless because holdup will run in its own container* you'll probably need extra network configuration to be able to access services* you won't be able to use `docker run` inside a container without exposing a docker daemon in said containerUsage=====usage: holdup [-h] [-t SECONDS] [-T SECONDS] [-i SECONDS] [-n] service [service ...] [-- command [arg [arg ...]]]Wait for services to be ready and optionally exec command.positional arguments:  service    A service to wait for. Supported protocols: &quot;tcp://host:port/&quot;, &quot;path:///path/to/something&quot;, &quot;unix:///path/to/domain.sock&quot;, &quot;eval://expr&quot;, &quot;pg://user:password@host:port/dbname&quot; (&quot;postgres&quot; and &quot;postgresql&quot; also allowed), &quot;http://urn&quot;, &quot;https://urn&quot;, &quot;https+insecure://urn&quot; (status 200 expected for http*). Join protocols with a comma to make holdup exit at the first passing one, eg: &quot;tcp://host:1,host:2&quot; or &quot;tcp://host:1,tcp://host:2&quot; are equivalent and mean `any that pass`.  command    An optional command to exec.optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -t SECONDS, --timeout SECONDS                        Time to wait for services to be ready. Default: 60.0  -T SECONDS, --check-timeout SECONDS                        Time to wait for a single check. Default: 1.0  -i SECONDS, --interval SECONDS                        How often to check. Default: 0.2  -v, --verbose         Verbose mode.  --verbose-passwords   Disable PostgreSQL/HTTP password masking.  -n, --no-abort        Ignore failed services. This makes `holdup` return 0 exit code regardless of services actually responding.  --insecure            Disable SSL Certificate verification for HTTPS services.  --version             display the version of the holdup package and its location, then exit.Example::    holdup tcp://foobar:1234 -- django-admin ...Documentation=============https://python-holdup.readthedocs.io/Development===========To run all the tests run::    toxNote, to combine the coverage data from all the tox environments run:.. list-table::    :widths: 10 90    :stub-columns: 1    - - Windows      - ::            set PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--cov-append            tox    - - Other      - ::            PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--cov-append toxChangelog=========4.0.0 (2023-02-14)------------------* Added support for psycopg 3 (now the ``holdup[pg]`` extra will require that). The old psycopg2 is still supported for now.* Dropped support for Python 3.6 and added in Python 3.11 in the test suite.3.0.0 (2022-03-20)------------------* Dropped support for Python 2.* Switched CI from Travis to GitHub Actions.* Fixed bugs with password masking (it wasn't working for postgresql URIs).2.0.0 (2021-04-08)------------------* Added support for password masking (``--verbose-passwords`` to disable this feature).* Overhauled checks display a bit, output might be slightly different.* Added support for basic and digest HTTP authentication.* Published Docker image at https://hub.docker.com/r/ionelmc/holdup (Alpine based).1.9.0 (2021-01-11)------------------* Added a ``--version`` argument.* Changed verbose output to mask passwords in postgresql checks.1.8.1 (2020-12-16)------------------* Add support for PostgreSQL 12+ clients (strict integer type-checking on ``connect_timeout``). The float is now converted to an integer.1.8.0 (2019-05-28)------------------* Added a PostgreSQL check. It handles the ``the database system is starting up`` problem.  Contributed by Dan Ailenei in ``6``.* Changed output so it's more clear and more brief:  * arguments (checks) are quoted when printed,  * &quot;any&quot; checks give exact info about what made it pass,  * repetitive information is removed.* Simplified the internals for the &quot;AnyCheck&quot;.1.7.0 (2018-11-24)------------------* Added support for skipping SSL certificate verification for HTTPS services  (the ``--insecure`` option and ``https+insecure`` protocol).  Contributed by Mithun Ayachit in ``2``.1.6.0 (2018-03-22)------------------* Added verbose mode (`-v` or ``--verbose``).* Changed default timeout to 60s (from 5s).1.5.0 (2017-06-07)------------------* Added an ``eval://expression`` protocol for weird user-defined checks.1.4.0 (2017-03-27)------------------* Added support for HTTP(S) check.1.3.0 (2017-02-21)------------------* Add support for &quot;any&quot; service check (service syntax with comma).1.2.1 (2016-06-17)------------------* Handle situation where internal operations would take more than planned.1.2.0 (2016-05-25)------------------* Added a file check.1.1.0 (2016-05-06)------------------* Removed debug print.* Added ``--interval`` option for how often to check. No more spinloops.1.0.0 (2016-04-22)------------------* Improved tests.* Always log to stderr.0.1.0 (2016-04-21)------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>
