PDFMiner allows to obtainthe exact location of texts in a page, as well as other information such as fonts or lines.It includes a PDF converter that can transform PDF filesinto other text formats (such as HTML). It has an extensiblePDF parser that can be used for other purposes instead of text analysis.We had to forked this because original package was removed from pypi</longdescription>
