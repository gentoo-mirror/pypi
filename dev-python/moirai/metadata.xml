	<longdescription># moiraiMoirai is the backend for the platform. It is developed as part of my scientificinitiation project, named Plataformas de baixo custo para controle de processos(low-cost platform for process control), developed at CEFET-MG (Brazil) underthe supervision of Prof. Dr. Valter Leite. The project was developed through aFAPEMIG scholaship.It's meant to be installed in a computer near the plant, so it can beremote-controlled by [Lachesis](https://github.com/acristoffers/Lachesis). Itexposes a RESTful API that let's you configure the hardware, save tests andcontrollers, execute them and fetch the results in real-time or after theexecution finishes.Controllers for this platform are written in Python 3 and can use any librarieavailable in the computer where _moirai_ is running. It already depends on NumPyand SciPy, as they are commonly used. This platform manages the hardwareinterfacing through the [ahio](https://github.com/acristoffers/ahio) libray, soextending it's hardware capabilities is a question of extending AHIO, whichshould be simple. Execution time, sampling time, input querying and outputupdating is managed by the application and let's you focus on yourcontroller/model.## InstallationUse pip to install. This is a Python 3 application and won't run in Python 2.Use `pip install moirai` or `pip3 install moirai` to install it. It also hasother dependencies not installable through pip, which can be installed byrunning `moirai --install --sudo`. It will install MongoDB (or MySQL onRaspberry Pi) and the Snap7 library. It's designed to work on Windows, macOS(with Homebrew) and Linux (apt-get, dnf, yum and zypper).If using the Snap7 driver on Windows, you may need to compile the driveryourself and copy it to /Windows/System32.On macOS, using Homebrew, you can install with:```bashbrew tap acristoffers/repobrew install moirai```## LicenseCopyright (c) 2016 Álan CrístofferPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy ofthis software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal inthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights touse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies ofthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESSFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
