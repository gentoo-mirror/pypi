This application must be available as a command in the same environment as the notebook server.- An application that can process `.bib` files for producing bibliographies. As with the LaTeX command, this must be available in the same environment as the notebook server.## InstallationThis extension includes both a notebook server extension (which interfaces with the LaTeX compiler)and a lab extension (which provides the UI for the LaTeX preview).The Python package named `jupyterlab_latex` provides both of them as a prebuilt extension.To install the extension, run the following in your terminal:```bashpip install jupyterlab_latex```### Check installationTo ensure that extension is properly installed, you could check server and lab extensions:```bashjupyter server extension list```and see the block like this in the output```jupyterlab_latex enabled    - Validating jupyterlab_latex...      jupyterlab_latex 3.1.0 OK```then```bashjupyter labextension list```and see the block like this in the output```@jupyterlab/latex v3.1.0 enabled OK (python, jupyterlab-latex)```## CustomizationThe extension defaults to running `xelatex` on the server.This command may be customized (e.g., to use `pdflatex` instead) by customizingyour `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file:```pythonc.LatexConfig.latex_command = 'pdflatex'```The extension defaults to running `bibtex` for generating a bibliographyif a `.bib` file is found. You can also configure the bibliography commandby setting```pythonc.LatexConfig.bib_command = '&lt;custom_bib_command&gt;'```### Security and customizing shell escapesLaTeX files have the ability to run arbitrary code by triggering externalshell commands. This is a security risk, and so most LaTeX distributionsrestrict the commands that you can run in the shell.You can customize the behavior by setting the `LatexConfig.shell_escape` value.It can take three values: `&quot;restricted&quot;` (default) to allow only commandsconsidered safe to be executed, `&quot;allow&quot;` to allow all commands, and `&quot;disallow&quot;`to disallow all commands.For example, to force your LaTeX distribution to run any command, use:```pythonc.LatexConfig.shell_escape = &quot;allow&quot;```## ChangesFor information on the changes with different versions of the `jupyterlab-latex` library, see our [changelog](./docs/changelog.md)</longdescription>
