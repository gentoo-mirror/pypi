	<longdescription># twinpics## IntroductionSocial Media Prediction Model## InstallationIn order to get this package working you will need to **install it via pip** (with a Python3.5 version or higher) on the terminal by typing:``$ pip install twinpics``Additionally, **if you want to use the latest version instead of the stable one**, you can just use the following command:``$ pip install git+https://github.com/albMart/Twinpics.git@developer``**The developer branch ensures the user that the most updated version will always be the working and fully operative** so as not to wait until the stable release on the master branch comes out (which eventually may take some time depending on the amount of issues to solve).## DocumentationYou can find the **complete developer documentation** at: https://twinpics.readthedocs.io/, hosted on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) and generated using [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) with the theme [sphinx_rtd_theme](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme) which is the standard Read the Docs theme for sphinx.## UsageSo as to use this Python package, a sample piece of code is presented below:```pythonimport twinpicstwinpics.sample_function()```So on, the previous piece of code outputs the following line:```{r, engine='python', count_lines}&quot;This is a sample function&quot;```## ContributeAs this is an open source project it is **open to contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements and ideas**. There is an open tab of [issues](https://github.com/albMart/Twinpics/issues) where anyone can open new issues if needed or navigate through them in order to solve them or contribute to its solving. Remember that **issues are not threads to describe multiple problems**, this does not mean that issues can't be discussed, but so to keep a structured project management, the same issue should not describe different problems, just the main one and some nested/related errors that may be found.## CitationWhen citing this repository on your publications please use the following **BibTeX** citation:```@misc{    twinpics,    author = { Alberto Mart√≠n Mateos and Niloufar Shoeibi },    title = { twinpics - Social Media Prediction Model },    year = { 2020 },    publisher = {GitHub},    journal = {GitHub Repository},    howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/albMart/twinpics}}}```### This repository has been generated using [pypackage-cookie](https://github.com/alvarobartt/pypackage-cookie) made with love by @alvarobartt</longdescription>
