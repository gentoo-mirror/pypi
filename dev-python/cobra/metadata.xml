By re-using the same classes and design principles, we can make newmethods both easier to implement and easier to use, thereby bringing the powerof COBRA to more researchers.The documentation is browseable online at `readthedocs&lt;https://cobrapy.readthedocs.org/en/stable/&gt;`_ and can also be `downloaded&lt;https://readthedocs.org/projects/cobrapy/downloads/&gt;`_.Please use the `Google Group &lt;http://groups.google.com/group/cobra-pie&gt;`_ forhelp. By writing a well formulated question, with sufficient detail, you aremuch more likely to quickly receive a good answer! Please refer to these`StackOverflow guidelines &lt;https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask&gt;`_ on howto ask questions.  Alternatively, you can use `gitter.im&lt;https://gitter.im/opencobra/cobrapy&gt;`_ for quick questions and discussionsabout COBRApy (faster response times). Please keep in mind that answers areprovided on a volunteer basis.More information about opencobra is available at the `website&lt;http://opencobra.github.io/&gt;`_.If you use COBRApy in a scientific publication, please cite`doi:10.1186/1752-0509-7-74 &lt;http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1186/1752-0509-7-74&gt;`_Installation============Use pip to `install COBRApy from PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/cobra/&gt;`_ (werecommend doing this inside a `virtual environment&lt;http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/&gt;`_)::    pip install cobraIf you want to load MATLAB models, you will need additional dependencies. Pleaseinstall::    pip install cobra[array]For further information, please follow the `detailed installation instructions&lt;INSTALL.rst&gt;`_.Contributing============Contributions are always welcome! Please read the `contributing guidelines&lt;https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy/blob/devel/.github/CONTRIBUTING.rst&gt;`_ toget started.License=======The COBRApy source is released under both the GPL and LGPL licenses version 2 orlater.

For usage instructions, please seethe `documentation &lt;https://cobrapy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&gt;`_.We only test against Python 3.7+, however, Python 3.4 or higher work mostly. For Windows users and possibly also Mac OS users, we recommend using the `Anaconda Python &lt;https://www.anaconda.com/&gt;`_ distribution.Stable version installation===========================COBRApy can be installed with any recent installation of pip.  Instructions forseveral operating systems are below:Mac OS X or Linux-----------------1. We highly recommend that you create a `Python virtual environment   &lt;https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer&gt;`_.2. Install COBRApy when an environment is active by running ``pip install   cobra`` in the terminal.Microsoft Windows-----------------If you heed our recommendation to use Anaconda, you can open an Anaconda shelland install COBRApy from the ``conda-forge`` channel... code-block:: console    conda install -c conda-forge cobraInstallation for development============================Get the `detailed contribution instructions &lt;.github/CONTRIBUTING.rst&gt;`_ forcontributing to COBRApy.Solvers=======COBRApy uses `optlang &lt;http://optlang.readthedocs.io&gt;`_ to interface themathematical solvers used to optimize the created COBRA models.  At the time ofwriting the supported solvers are:- ILOG/CPLEX (available with `Academic  &lt;https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/university/academicinitiative/&gt;`_ and  `Commercial  &lt;http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimizer/&gt;`_  licenses)- `Gurobi &lt;http://gurobi.com&gt;`_- `GLPK &lt;http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/&gt;`_ which is automatically installed  as swiglpk</longdescription>
