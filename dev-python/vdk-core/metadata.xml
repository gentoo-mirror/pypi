	<longdescription># Versatile Data Kit SDK CoreTo build or contribute, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).Versatile Data Kit enables data engineers, data scientists and data analysts to develop, deploy, run, and manage data processing workloads (called &quot;Data Job&quot;).A &quot;Data Job&quot; enables Data Engineers to implement automated pull ingestion (E in ELT) and batch data transformation into a database (T in ELT).## BuildMake sure you have python3 installed. It's strongly recommended to use a virtual environment, and also to use a python installer like pyenv or conda. We recommend pyenv.CICD is managed through gitlab-ci.yml. You can see how to build, run tests, deploy there best.All related CICD scripts are in /cicd/ folder.## InstallationAll Versatile Data Kit SDK Core releases can be found in PyPI.Install Versatile Data Kit SDK Core with:```bashpip install vdk-core```This will install console application called `vdk`Then run help to see what it can do:```bashvdk --help```## PluginsPlugins are a powerful way of extending or adapting Versatile Data Kit for all kinds of use-cases.For more information see [Plugins doc](../vdk-plugins/README.md).## Public interfacesAny backwards compatibility guarantees apply only to public interfaces.Public interfaces are modules and packages defined or imported in vdk.api.*.unless the documentation explicitly declares them to be provisional or internal interfaces.Anything else is considered internal.All public interfaces (classes or methods) must have documentation.</longdescription>
