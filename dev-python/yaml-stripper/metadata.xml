You can download and install Python 3 from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/After installing Python 3, you can install YamlStripper using pip, the Python package manager:```pip install yaml-stripper```## UsageTo use YamlStripper, open a command prompt or terminal window and type the following command:```yaml-stripper input_file output_file -f field1 field2 ...```where:- `input_file` - The input YAML file to remove fields from.- `output_file` - The output YAML file without the specified fields.- `-f field1 field2 ...` - The fields to remove from the input YAML file.For example, if you have a YAML file called `example.yaml` with the following contents:```yamlname: Johnage: 30email: john@example.comphone: 123-456-7890```and you want to remove the `email` and `phone` fields from this YAML file and save the result in a new file called `stripped.yaml`, you can use the following command:```yaml-stripper example.yaml stripped.yaml -f email phone```After running the command, a new file called `stripped.yaml` will be created with the following contents:```yamlname: Johnage: 30```## ExamplesHere are some more examples of how to use YamlStripper:### Example 1Suppose you have a YAML file called `data.yaml` with the following contents:```yamlname: Aliceage: 25email: alice@example.comphone: 987-654-3210address:  street: 123 Main St  city: Anytown  state: CA  zip: 12345```You want to remove the `email` and `phone` fields from this YAML file and save the result in a new file called `stripped.yaml`. Here's how you can use YamlStripper to achieve this:```yaml-stripper data.yaml stripped.yaml -f email phone```After running the command, a new file called `stripped.yaml` will be created with the following contents:```yamlname: Aliceage: 25address:  street: 123 Main St  city: Anytown  state: CA  zip: 12345```### Example 2Suppose you have a YAML file called `config.yaml` with the following contents:```yamldebug: trueport: 8000database:  host: localhost  port: 5432  name: mydb  user: myuser  password: mypass```You want to remove the `debug` field from this YAML file and save the result in a new file called `stripped.yaml`. Here's how you can use YamlStripper to achieve this:```yaml-stripper config.yaml stripped.yaml -f debug```After running the command, a new file called `stripped.yaml` will be created with the following contents:```yamlport: 8000database:  host: localhost  port: 5432  name: mydb  user: myuser </longdescription>
