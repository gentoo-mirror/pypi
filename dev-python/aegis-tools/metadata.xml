	<longdescription>A combination of tools and framework, Aegis has multiple different uses. You can import it and use the thoroughly made and tested functions. You can use it as a natural extension for the tornado web framework. And you can use it to quickly create a new web application with the structure already built-in, and follow along.</longdescription>
