	<longdescription># Python Path`python_path` is a simple utility that lets you cleanly add routes to your `PYTHON_PATH`. Its very useful to safely load scripts from other folders.## InstallingYou can install `python_path` from pip```pip install python_path```## UsageLets do an example, image you have the following project structure```- my_project/  - main.py  - some_folder/    - other.py    - another_folder/      - another.py```Say we want to load `other.py` form `main.py`, since some_folder is not a submodule because it doesn't contain a `__init__.py` then we need to add `some_folder` to the `PYTHON_PATH`. To make this very easy we'll use `python_path` like this:```python# my_project/main.pyfrom python_path import PythonPathwith PythonPath(&quot;some_folder&quot;):    import other```and execute the file like this:```bashcd my_projectpython main.py```Here `some_folder` is added relative the `PWD` (`my_project`), if you are executing `main.py` from another directory and still want to reference `some_folder`, then you should directly state relative to what file or folder the operations are being done:```python# my_project/main.pyfrom python_path import PythonPathwith PythonPath(&quot;some_folder&quot;, relative_to = __file__):    import other```The previous is equivalent to:```python# my_project/main.pyfrom python_path import PythonPathimport ospath = os.path.dirname(__file__)path = os.path.join(path, &quot;some_folder&quot;)with PythonPath(path):    import other```Now we can also execute the script from any path and it sould still work e.g:```bashpython my_project/main.py```Finally we can also navigate the folder structure by passing multiple parameters, so if we want to import `main.py` from `another.py` which is inside `another_folder` we could do it like this```python# my_project/some_folder/another_folder/another.pyfrom python_path import PythonPathwith PythonPath(&quot;..&quot;, &quot;..&quot;, relative_to = __file__):    import main```This is equivalent to```python# my_project/some_folder/another_folder/another.pyfrom python_path import PythonPathimport ospath = os.path.join(&quot;..&quot;, &quot;..&quot;)with PythonPath(path, relative_to = __file__):    import main```</longdescription>
