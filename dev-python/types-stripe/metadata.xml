	<longdescription>## Typing stubs for stripeThis is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)type stub package for the [`stripe`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python) package.It can be used by type-checking tools like[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses`stripe`.This version of `types-stripe` aims to provide accurate annotationsfor `stripe==3.5.*`.The source for this package can be found athttps://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/stripe. All fixes fortypes and metadata should be contributed there.*Note:* The `stripe` package includes type annotations or type stubssince version 7.1.0. Please uninstall the `types-stripe`package if you use this or a newer version.This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.This package was generated from typeshed commit `19650767da0bcd01b8e9dc98b4b873522edbf6f9` and was testedwith mypy 1.6.1, pyright 1.1.334, andpytype 2023.10.17.</longdescription>
