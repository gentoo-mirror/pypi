This template would result in the creation of three roles: &quot;dev_cloudwatch&quot;,&quot;staging_cloudwatch&quot;, and &quot;prod_cloudwatch&quot; on the respective AWS accounts.See the [Getting Started guide for AWS](https://docs.iambic.org/getting_started/aws), the AWS IAM Role section of our [Example Templates repository](https://github.com/noqdev/iambic-templates-examples/blob/main/resources/aws/iam/role/all_accounts/account_name_iambic_test_role.yaml), and our [blog post on multi-account roles](https://www.noq.dev/blog/aws-permission-bouncers-letting-loose-in-dev-keeping-it-tight-in-prod) for more information.```yamltemplate_type: NOQ::AWS::IAM::Roleidentifier: '{{var.account_name}}_cloudwatch'included_accounts:    - dev    - staging    - prodproperties:  description:    - description: Cloudwatch role for {{var.account_name}}  assume_role_policy_document:    statement:      - action:          - sts:AssumeRole          - sts:TagSession        effect: Allow        principal:          aws: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ExampleRole    version: '2012-10-17'  inline_policies:    policy_name: cloudwatch_logs    statement:      - effect: allow        action:            - logs:DescribeLogGroups            - logs:DescribeLogStreams            - logs:GetLogEvents            - logs:GetLogRecord            - logs:GetQueryResults            - logs:TestMetricFilter            - logs:FilterLogEvents            - logs:StartQuery            - logs:StopQuery        resource: &quot;*&quot;  managed_policies:    - policy_arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess  role_name: '{{var.account_name}}_cloudwatch'  tags:    - key: owner      value: devops```### AWS Dynamic PermissionsCreate a BackendDeveloperRole with varying permissions based on the AWS account. See the [Getting Started guide for AWS](https://docs.iambic.org/getting_started/aws) for more information.```yamltemplate_type: NOQ::AWS::IAM::Roleidentifier: '{{var.account_name}}_backend_developer'included_accounts:  - '*'excluded_accounts:  - complianceproperties:  description:    - description: Backend developer role for {{var.account_name}}  assume_role_policy_document:    statement:      - action:          - sts:AssumeRole          - sts:TagSession        effect: Allow        principal:          aws: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ExampleRole    version: '2012-10-17'  inline_policies:    - policy_name: s3_policy      statement:        - # Policy applies to role on all accounts except `customer_data`.          excluded_accounts:            - customer_data          effect: allow          action:              - s3:GetObject              - s3:ListObject          resource:              - &quot;*&quot;          condition:            StringNotEquals:                s3:ResourceTag/sensitive: 'true'        - # Allow write access to non-sensitive resources on the dev account          included_accounts:            - dev          effect: allow          action:              - s3:PutObject          resource:              - &quot;*&quot;          condition:                StringNotEquals:                    s3:ResourceTag/sensitive: 'true'  role_name: '{{var.account_name}}_backend_developer'  tags:    - key: owner      value: devops```### AWS Identity Center (SSO) Permission SetsCreate an AWS Identity Center (SSO) permission set with varying permissions based on the AWS account. See the [Getting Started guide for AWS](https://docs.iambic.org/getting_started/aws), the AWS IC/SSO Permission Set section of our [Example Templates repository](https://github.com/noqdev/iambic-templates-examples/blob/main/resources/aws/identity_center/permission_set/design.yaml), and our blog post on [Tailoring AWS Identity Center (SSO) Permissions Per Account with IAMbic](https://www.noq.dev/blog/tailor-aws-identity-center-sso-permissions-per-account-with-iambic) for more information.```yamltemplate_type: NOQ::AWS::IdentityCenter::PermissionSetaccess_rules:  - expires_at: 2028-05-19T14:17 UTC    groups:      - engineeringidentifier: designproperties:  name: design  customer_managed_policy_references:    - name: base_deny  inline_policy:    statement:      - action:          - ec2:list*        effect: Deny        resource:          - '*'      - action:          - ec2:list*        effect: Deny        expires_at: 2033-05-19T14:17 UTC        resource:          - '*'  managed_policies:    - arn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSHealthFullAccess  permissions_boundary:    customer_managed_policy_reference:      name: base_permission_boundary  session_duration: PT4H  tags:    - key: owner      value: design@example.com```### Okta Application AssignmentsManage Okta application assignments, including expiration dates for specific users. See the [Getting Started guide for Okta](https://docs.iambic.org/getting_started/okta) for more information.```yamltemplate_type: NOQ::Okta::Appidp_name: developmentproperties:  name: Salesforce.com  assignments:    - user: username@example.com    - user: username2@example.com    - user: username3@example.com      expires_at: 2023-09-01T00:00 UTC  status: ACTIVE```### AWS Service Control PoliciesManaging access to AWS services can be a tricky business. That's where Service Control Policies (SCPs) come in. SCPs allow you to define what services and actions are accessible within your AWS accounts. With IAMbic, you can import your existing SCPs, create new ones that restrict access to specific AWS services, and prevent any drift from occurring to ensure that you're protecting sensitive information the way you intend.For instance, let's say you want to limit access to certain AWS regions. You can create an SCP that denies access to all regions except those you specify. This can be particularly useful if you're looking to maintain tighter control over your data residency and compliance.Here's an example of how you can set this up:```yamltemplate_type: NOQ::AWS::Organizations::SCPaccount_id: '123456789012'iambic_managed: enforcedidentifier: RestrictRegionsorg_id: o-123456properties:  policy_document:    statement:      - condition:          StringNotEquals:            aws:RequestedRegion:              - us-east-1              - us-west-2        effect: Deny        not_action:          - a4b:*          - budgets:*          - ce:*          - chime:*          - cloudfront:*          - cur:*          - globalaccelerator:*          - health:*          - iam:*          - importexport:*          - mobileanalytics:*          - organizations:*          - route53:*          - route53domains:*          - shield:*          - support:*          - trustedadvisor:*          - waf:*          - wellarchitected:*        resource:          - '*'  policy_name: RestrictRegions  targets:    roots:      - r-123```In this example, the SCP named `RestrictRegions` denies access to all AWS regions except `us-east-1` and `us-west-2`. It also excludes certain global services from the restriction.For more information on how to get started with AWS and SCPs, check out our [Getting Started guide for AWS](https://docs.iambic.org/getting_started/aws) and the [AWS SCP Section of our Example Templates repository](https://github.com/noqdev/iambic-templates-examples/blob/main/resources/aws/organizations/scp/iambic_test_org_account/restrict_regions.yaml). You can also learn more about tailoring AWS Identity Center (SSO) permissions per account with IAMbic in our [blog post](https://noq-0.webflow.io/blog/scps-protecting-your-aws-environment-and-your-job).### Okta Group AssignmentsEasily manage Okta group assignments with expiration dates for members. See the [Getting Started guide for Okta](https://docs.iambic.org/getting_started/okta) for more information.```yamltemplate_type: NOQ::Okta::Groupidp_name: mainproperties:  name: engineering_interns  description: Engineering Interns  members:    - username: intern1@example.com      expires_at: 2023-09-01 # Interns last day    - username: intern2@example.com      expires_at: 2023-09-01```### Google Group AssignmentsManage Google Workspace group assignments, including temporary access for external users.
