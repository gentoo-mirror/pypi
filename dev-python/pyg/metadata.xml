	<longdescription>WARNING - Important notice==========================This project is now **DEAD**.It was born with the intent to provide a better (IMHO) alternative to Pip.Since now Pip has got a lot of great improvements, this is not needed anymore.So the advice here is to use Pip instead. Pyg has not been maintained for over2 years now. It may well be broken in many places. The code is old and wouldneed a refactoring, but there is not need anymore.Pyg===Pyg is a Python Package Manager that is meant to be an alternative to easy_install.Installation-----------To install Pyg it takes only one simple command::    $ pip install pygor if you must::    $ easy_install pygAnd then you should no more need them!Installing from source----------------------Also, you can download the source and after unpacking the archive::    $ python setup.py install**Note:** You may need root privileges to install.Documentation------------If you need further information you can check the documentation at: http://pyg-installer.co.nrBuilding the documentation~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~You can build the documentation locally. In order to build the html documentation you need to install `Sphinx`_. Simply run::    $ pyg install sphinxAgain, you may need root privileges.Now you can build the docs. If you haven't already downloaded the source download it and open your terminal::    $ cd docs    $ make htmlThe docs are now in ``_build/html/``.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org</longdescription>
