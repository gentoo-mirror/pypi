	<longdescription>Python Interface to the Epics Channel Access protocol of theEpics control system.   PyEpics provides 3 layers of access toChannel Access (CA):1. a light wrapping of the CA C library calls, using ctypes. Thisprovides a procedural CA library in which the user is expectedto manage Channel IDs. It is mostly provided as a foundationupon which higher-level access is built.2. PV() (Process Variable) objects, which represent the basic objectin CA, allowing one to keep a persistent connection to a remoteProcess Variable.3. A simple set of functions caget(), caput() and so on to mimicthe CA command-line tools and give the simplest access to CA.In addition, the library includes convenience classes to defineDevices -- collections of PVs that might represent an Epics Recordor physical device (say, a camera, amplifier, or power supply), andto help write GUIs for CA.</longdescription>
