PRAW aims to be easy to use and internally follows all of`Reddit's API rules &lt;https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API&gt;`_. With PRAW there's noneed to introduce ``sleep`` calls in your code. Give your client an appropriate useragent and you're set... _installation:Installation------------PRAW is supported on Python 3.7+. The recommended way to install PRAW is via `pip&lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip&gt;`_... code-block:: bash    pip install prawTo install the latest development version of PRAW run the following instead:.. code-block:: bash    pip install --upgrade https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/archive/master.zipFor instructions on installing Python and pip see &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python&quot;`Installation Guides &lt;https://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/&gt;`_.Quickstart----------Assuming you already have a credentials for a script-type OAuth application you caninstantiate an instance of PRAW like so:.. code-block:: python    import praw    reddit = praw.Reddit(        client_id=&quot;CLIENT_ID&quot;,        client_secret=&quot;CLIENT_SECRET&quot;,        password=&quot;PASSWORD&quot;,        user_agent=&quot;USERAGENT&quot;,        username=&quot;USERNAME&quot;,    )With the ``reddit`` instance you can then interact with Reddit:.. code-block:: python    # Create a submission to r/test    reddit.subreddit(&quot;test&quot;).submit(&quot;Test Submission&quot;, url=&quot;https://reddit.com&quot;)    # Comment on a known submission    submission = reddit.submission(url=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/comments/5e1az9&quot;)    submission.reply(&quot;Super rad!&quot;)    # Reply to the first comment of a weekly top thread of a moderated community    submission = next(reddit.subreddit(&quot;mod&quot;).top(time_filter=&quot;week&quot;))    submission.comments[0].reply(&quot;An automated reply&quot;)    # Output score for the first 256 items on the frontpage    for submission in reddit.front.hot(limit=256):        print(submission.score)    # Obtain the moderator listing for r/test    for moderator in reddit.subreddit(&quot;test&quot;).moderator():        print(moderator)Please see PRAW's `documentation &lt;https://praw.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_ for more examples ofwhat you can do with PRAW.Discord Bots and Asynchronous Environments------------------------------------------If you plan on using PRAW in an asynchronous environment, (e.g., discord.py, asyncio) itis strongly recommended to use `Async PRAW &lt;https://asyncpraw.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_.
