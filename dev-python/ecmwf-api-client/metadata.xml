	<longdescription># ecmwf-api-client# InstallationInstall via pip with:&gt; $ pip install ecmwf-api-client# Configure## Anonymous access (default, not recommended)Anonymous access is the default type of access, with no configuration needed.However, anonymous access is only available for a limited set of datasets, and comes with a much lower quality of service. For access to all the available datasets, and an improved quality of service, please use registered access (see below).## Registered access (recommended)* Register with ECMWF at https://apps.ecmwf.int/registration/.* Login at https://apps.ecmwf.int/auth/login/.* Retrieve you API access key at https://api.ecmwf.int/v1/key/.   Note that the API access key expires in 1 year. You will receive an email to the registered email address 1 month before the expiration date with the renewal instructions. To check the expiry date of your current key, log into www.ecmwf.int, and go to https://api.ecmwf.int/v1/key/.* Copy and paste the API access key into the file $HOME/.ecmwfapirc (Unix/Linux) or %USERPROFILE%\\.ecmwfapirc (Windows: usually in C:\\Users\\\&lt;USERNAME\&gt;\\.ecmwfapirc).   Your $HOME/.ecmwfapirc (Unix/Linux) or %USERPROFILE%\\.ecmwfapirc (Windows) should look something like this:   ```   {       &quot;url&quot;   : &quot;https://api.ecmwf.int/v1&quot;,       &quot;key&quot;   : &quot;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&quot;,       &quot;email&quot; : &quot;john.smith@example.com&quot;   }   ```* Alternatively, one can use a file of their own liking, and point to it using environment variable `ECMWF_API_RC_FILE`. `ECMWF_API_RC_FILE` should be set to the full path of the given file. This method takes priority of the previous method of using a .ecmwfapirc file.* As yet another option, one can set the API access key values directly in the environment using variables `ECMWF_API_KEY` (key), `ECMWF_API_URL` (url), `ECMWF_API_EMAIL` (email). This method takes priority over the previous method of using environment variable `ECMWF_API_RC_FILE`.   # ExampleYou can test this small python script to retrieve TIGGE (https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/tigge) data. Note that access to TIGGE data requires registered access, and is subject to accepting a licence at https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/tigge/licence/.```#!/usr/bin/env pythonfrom ecmwfapi import ECMWFDataServer# To run this example, you need an API key# available from https://api.ecmwf.int/v1/key/server = ECMWFDataServer()server.retrieve({    'origin'    : &quot;ecmf&quot;,    'levtype'   : &quot;sfc&quot;,    'number'    : &quot;1&quot;,    'expver'    : &quot;prod&quot;,    'dataset'   : &quot;tigge&quot;,    'step'      : &quot;0/6/12/18&quot;,    'area'      : &quot;70/-130/30/-60&quot;,    'grid'      : &quot;2/2&quot;,    'param'     : &quot;167&quot;,    'time'      : &quot;00/12&quot;,    'date'      : &quot;2014-11-01&quot;,    'type'      : &quot;pf&quot;,    'class'     : &quot;ti&quot;,    'target'    : &quot;tigge_2014-11-01_0012.grib&quot;})```# LoggingLogging messages by default are emitted to `stdout` using Python's `print` statement.To change that behaviour, one can define their own logging function and use it like so:```import loggingfrom ecmwfapi import ECMWFDataServerlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)def my_logging_function(msg):    logging.info(msg)server = ECMWFDataServer(log=my_logging_function)```# LicenseCopyright 2019 European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the “License”); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
