Top row: Cell maps showing all cells (left), cellline 1 (middle), and cellline 2 (right). Celline 1 was the fastest growing cell line at high energy levels, celline 2 at low energy levels. Middle and bottom rows: Development of total cell count and molecule concentrations over time._### InstallationFor CPU alone you can just do:```bashpip install magicsoup```This simulation relies on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).To increase performance you can move calculations to a GPU.In this case you should setup PyTorch first before installing MagicSoup.To setup pytorch correctly for your GPU see [Get Started (pytorch.org)](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).### ExampleThe basic building blocks of what a cell can do are defined by the world's chemistry.There are molecules and reactions that can convert these molecules.Cells can develop proteins with domains that can transport these molecules,catalyze the reactions, and be regulated by molecules.Any reaction or transport happens only if energetically favourable.Below, I am defining the reaction $CO2 + NADPH \rightleftharpoons formiat + NADP$.Each molecule species is defined with a energy.```pythonimport torchimport magicsoup as msNADPH = ms.Molecule(&quot;NADPH&quot;, 200 * 1e3)NADP = ms.Molecule(&quot;NADP&quot;, 100 * 1e3)formiat = ms.Molecule(&quot;formiat&quot;, 20 * 1e3)co2 = ms.Molecule(&quot;CO2&quot;, 10 * 1e3)molecules = [NADPH, NADP, formiat, co2]reactions = [([co2, NADPH], [formiat, NADP])]chemistry = ms.Chemistry(reactions=reactions, molecules=molecules)world = ms.World(chemistry=chemistry)```By coupling multiple domains within the same protein, energetically unfavourable actionscan be powered with the energy of energetically favourable ones.These domains, their specifications, and how they are coupled in proteins, is all encoded in the cell's genome.Here, I am generating 100 cells with random genomes of 500 basepairs each and place themin random places on the 2D world map.```pythongenomes = [ms.random_genome(s=500) for _ in range(100)]world.spawn_cells(genomes=genomes)```Cells discover new proteins by chance through mutations.In the function below all cells experience 1E-3 random point mutations per nucleotide.10% of them will be indels.```pythondef mutate_cells(world: ms.World):    mutated = ms.point_mutations(seqs=world.cell_genomes)    world.update_cells(genome_idx_pairs=mutated)```Evolutionary pressure can be applied by selectively killing or replicating cells.Here, cells have an increased chance of dying when formiat gets too lowand an increased chance of replicating when formiat gets high.```pythondef sample(p: torch.Tensor) -&gt; list[int]:    idxs = torch.argwhere(torch.bernoulli(p))    return idxs.flatten().tolist()def kill_cells(world: ms.World):    x = world.cell_molecules[:, 2]    idxs = sample(.01 / (.01 + x))    world.kill_cells(cell_idxs=idxs)def replicate_cells(world: ms.World):    x = world.cell_molecules[:, 2]    idxs = sample(x ** 3 / (x ** 3 + 20.0 ** 3))    world.divide_cells(cell_idxs=idxs)```Finally, the simulation itself is run in a python loop by repetitively calling the different steps.With `world.enzymatic_activity()` chemical reactions and molecule transportin cells advance by one time step.`world.diffuse_molecules()` lets molecules on the world map diffuse and permeate through cell membranes(if they can) by one time step.```pythonfor _ in range(1000):    world.enzymatic_activity()    kill_cells(world=world)    replicate_cells(world=world)    mutate_cells(world=world)    world.diffuse_molecules()    world.increment_cell_lifetimes()```See the [Docs](https://magic-soup.readthedocs.io/) for more examples and a description of all the mechanics of this simulation</longdescription>
