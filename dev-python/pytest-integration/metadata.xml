	<longdescription>pytest-integration==================Overview--------Plugin for [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/) to mark tests asintegration or slow integration.Integration tests are run after normal tests (unit tests) andslow integration tests are run after (quick) integration tests.If a unit test fails, (quick) integration and slow integration tests are not run.If a (quick) integration tests fails, slow integration tests are not run.If you have also installed [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/),then code coverage is disabled for all integration tests, since unit testsare supposed to cover all the code.Added pytest markers--------------------------- `@pytest.mark.integration_test` Marks this test as a (quick) integration test- `@pytest.mark.slow_integration_test` Marks this test as a slow integration testAdded pytest command line options--------------------------- `--with-integration` Run (quick) integration tests (default)- `--with-slow-integration` Run slow integration tests (default)- `--integration-cover` Let integration tests contribute to coverage`with` options also have a `without` variant.Example-------See the example directory. Examples of how to run are in the Makefile.Compatibility-------------- When running under xdist, each node will pick tests based on an index. That  means that nodes that receive only unit tests that pass, will continue to run  (slow) integration tests, even if another node receives a unit test that  fails.</longdescription>
