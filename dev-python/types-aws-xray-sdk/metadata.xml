	<longdescription>## Typing stubs for aws-xray-sdkThis is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)type stub package for the [`aws-xray-sdk`](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python) package.It can be used by type-checking tools like[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses`aws-xray-sdk`.This version of `types-aws-xray-sdk` aims to provide accurate annotationsfor `aws-xray-sdk==2.12.*`.The source for this package can be found athttps://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/aws-xray-sdk. All fixes fortypes and metadata should be contributed there.This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.This package was generated from typeshed commit `cc38a755878f31932a245152963ea52ef864a3cf` and was testedwith mypy 1.5.1, pyright 1.1.330, andpytype 2023.8.31.</longdescription>
