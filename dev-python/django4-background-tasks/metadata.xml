This project was adopted and adapted from lilspikey_ `django-background-task`... _Ruby's DelayedJob: https://github.com/tobi/delayed_job.. _lilspikey: https://github.com/lilspikey/To avoid conflicts on PyPI we renamed it to django-background-tasks (plural). For an easy upgrade from django-background-task to django-background-tasks, the internal module structure were left untouched.In Django Background Task, all tasks are implemented as functions (or any other callable).There are two parts to using background tasks:- creating the task functions and registering them with the scheduler- setup a cron task (or long running process) to execute the tasksDocs====See `Read the docs`_... _Read the docs: http://django4-background-tasks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</longdescription>
