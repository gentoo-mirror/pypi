Its strength lies in the fact that it can accurately predictretention times for modified peptides, even if hasn't seen said modificationduring training.DeepLC can be used through the[web application](https://iomics.ugent.be/deeplc/),locally with a graphical user interface (GUI), or as a Python package. In thelatter case, DeepLC can be used from the command line, or as a Python module.## CitationIf you use DeepLC for your research, please use the following citation:&gt;**DeepLC can predict retention times for peptides that carry as-yet unseen modifications**  &gt;Robbin Bouwmeester, Ralf Gabriels, Niels Hulstaert, Lennart Martens &amp; Sven Degroeve  &gt; Nature Methods 18, 1363â€“1369 (2021) [doi: 10.1038/s41592-021-01301-5](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01301-5)## Usage### Web application[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://iomics.ugent.be/deeplc/)Just go to [iomics.ugent.be/deeplc](https://iomics.ugent.be/deeplc/) and get started!### Graphical user interface#### In an existing Python environment (cross-platform)1. In your terminal with Python (&gt;=3.7) installed, run `pip install deeplc[gui]`2. Start the GUI with the command `deeplc-gui` or `python -m deeplc.gui`#### Standalone installer (Windows)[![Download GUI](https://flat.badgen.net/badge/download/GUI/blue)](https://github.com/compomics/DeepLC/releases/latest/)1. Download the DeepLC installer (`DeepLC-...-Windows-64bit.exe`) from the[latest release](https://github.com/compomics/DeepLC/releases/latest/)2. Execute the installer3. If Windows Smartscreen shows a popup window with &quot;Windows protected your PC&quot;,click on &quot;More info&quot; and then on &quot;Run anyway&quot;. You will have to trust us thatDeepLC does not contain any viruses, or you can check the source code ðŸ˜‰4. Go through the installation steps5.

However, if themodification is **very** different from the peptides the model has seen duringtraining the accuracy might not be satisfactory for you. For example, if the modelhas never seen a phosphor atom before, the accuracy of the prediction is going tobe low.**__Q: Installation fails. Why?__**Please make sure to install DeepLC in a path that does not contain spaces. Runthe latest LTS version of Ubuntu or Windows 10. Make sure you have enough diskspace available, surprisingly TensorFlow needs quite a bit of disk space. Ifyou are still not able to install DeepLC, please feel free to contact us:Robbin.Bouwmeester@ugent.be and Ralf.Gabriels@ugent.be**__Q: I have a special usecase that is not supported. Can you help?__**Ofcourse, please feel free to contact us:Robbin.Bouwmeester@ugent.be and Ralf.Gabriels@ugent.be**__Q: DeepLC runs out of memory. What can I do?__**You can try to reduce the batch size. DeepLC should be able to run if the batch size is lowenough, even on machines with only 4 GB of RAM.**__Q: I have a graphics card, but DeepLC is not using the GPU. Why?__**For now DeepLC defaults to the CPU instead of the GPU. Clearly, because you wantto use the GPU, you are a power user :-). If you want to make the most of that expensiveGPU, you need to change or remove the following line (at the top) in __deeplc.py__:```# Set to force CPU calculationsos.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '-1'```Also change the same line in the function __reset_keras()__:```# Set to force CPU calculationsos.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '-1'```Either remove the line or change to (where the number indicates the number of GPUs):```# Set to force CPU calculationsos.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '1'```**__Q: What modification name should I use?__**The names from unimod are used. The PSI-MS name is used by default, but the Interim nameis used as a fall-back if the PSI-MS name is not available. Please also see __unimod_to_formula.csv__in the folder __unimod/__ for the naming of specific modifications.**__Q: I have a modification that is not in unimod. How can I add the modification?__**In the folder __unimod/__ there is the file __unimod_to_formula.csv__ that can be used toadd modifications. In the CSV file add a name (**that is unique and not present yet**) andthe change in atomic composition. For example:```Met-&gt;Hse,O,H(-2) C(-1) S(-1)```Make sure to use negative signs for the atoms subtracted.**__Q: Help, all my predictions are between [0,10]. Why?__**It is likely you did not use calibration. No problem, but the retention times for trainingpurposes were normalized between [0,10]. This means that you probably need to adjust theretention time yourselve after analysis or use a calibration set as the input.**__Q: What does the option `dict_divider` do?__**This parameter defines the precision to use for fast-lookup of retention timesfor calibration. A value of 10 means a precision of 0.1 (and 100 a precision of0.01) between the calibration anchor points. This parameter does not influencethe precision of the calibration, but setting it too high might mean that thereis bad selection of the models between anchor points. A safe value is usuallyhigher than 10.**__Q: What does the option `split_cal` do?__**The option `split_cal`, or split calibration, sets number of divisions of thechromatogram for piecewise linear calibration. If the value is set to 10 thechromatogram is split up into 10 equidistant parts. For each part the medianvalue of the calibration peptides is selected. These are the anchor points.Between each anchor point a linear fit is made. This option has no effect whenthe pyGAM generalized additive models are used for calibration.**__Q: How does the ensemble part of DeepLC work?__**Models within the same directory are grouped if they overlap in their name. The overlaphas to be in their full name, except for the last part of the name after a &quot;_&quot;-character.The following models will be grouped:```full_hc_dia_fixed_mods_a.hdf5full_hc_dia_fixed_mods_b.hdf5```None of the following models will not be grouped:```full_hc_dia_fixed_mods2_a.hdf5full_hc_dia_fixed_mods_b.hdf5full_hc_dia_fixed_mods_2_b.hdf5```**__Q: I would like to take the ensemble average of multiple models, even if they are trained on different datasets. How can I do this?__**Feel free to experiment! Models within the same directory are grouped if they overlap intheir name. The overlap has to be in their full name, except for the last part of thename after a &quot;_&quot;-character.The following models will be grouped:```model_dataset1.hdf5model_dataset2.hdf5```So you just need to rename your models.</longdescription>
