The python implementation ofWPILib is intended to be very close to the implementations in the other languages,which is where packages like this come in.* Most anything will be accepted, but ideally full frameworks will be separate  packages and don't belong here* Ideally, contributions will have unit tests* Ideally, contributions will not have external python dependencies other than  WPILib -- though, this may change.* Contributions will work (or at least, not break) on all supported RobotPy  platforms (Windows/Linux/OSX, RoboRio)* All pull requests will be tested using Travis-CIInstallation------------This library is automatically installed when you install pyfrc or RobotPyLicense-------BSD License, similar to WPILib.Authors-------- Dustin Spicuzza (dustin@virtualroadside.com)- Tim Winters (twinters@wpi.edu)- David Vo (@auscompgeek)- Insert your name here!</longdescription>
