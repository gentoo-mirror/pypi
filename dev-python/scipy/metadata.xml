It includes modules for statistics, optimization,integration, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, signal and image processing,ODE solvers, and more.- **Website:** https://scipy.org- **Documentation:** https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/- **Development version of the documentation:** https://scipy.github.io/devdocs- **Mailing list:** https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/scipy-dev.python.org/- **Source code:** https://github.com/scipy/scipy- **Contributing:** https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/index.html- **Bug reports:** https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues- **Code of Conduct:** https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/dev/conduct/code_of_conduct.html- **Report a security vulnerability:** https://tidelift.com/docs/security- **Citing in your work:** https://www.scipy.org/citing-scipy/SciPy is built to work withNumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines,such as routines for numerical integration and optimization. Together, theyrun on all popular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free ofcharge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be dependedupon by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers. If you need tomanipulate numbers on a computer and display or publish the results, giveSciPy a try!For the installation instructions, see `our installguide &lt;https://scipy.org/install/&gt;`__.Call for Contributions----------------------We appreciate and welcome contributions. Small improvements or fixes are always appreciated; issues labeled as &quot;goodfirst issue&quot; may be a good starting point. Have a look at `our contributingguide &lt;https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/index.html&gt;`__.Writing code isn’t the only way to contribute to SciPy. You can also:- review pull requests- triage issues- develop tutorials, presentations, and other educational materials- maintain and improve `our website &lt;https://github.com/scipy/scipy.org&gt;`__- develop graphic design for our brand assets and promotional materials- help with outreach and onboard new contributors- write grant proposals and help with other fundraising effortsIf you’re unsure where to start or how your skills fit in, reach out! You canask on the mailing list or here, on GitHub, by leaving acomment on a relevant issue that is already open.If you are new to contributing to open source, `thisguide &lt;https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/&gt;`__ helps explain why, what,and how to get involved.</longdescription>
