	<longdescription># Gorilla CLIGorilla CLI revolutionizes your command-line interactions with a user-centric tool that understands natural language commands. Simply state your objective, and Gorilla CLI will generate potential commands for execution. No more need to recall intricate command-line arguments!Developed by UC Berkeley as a research prototype, Gorilla-CLI prioritizes user control and confidentiality: - Commands are executed solely with your explicit approval. - While we utilize queries and error logs (stderr) for model enhancement, we NEVER collect output data (stdout).## Getting StartedYou can readily install Gorilla CLI via pip. ```bashpip install gorilla-cli```## UsageActivate Gorilla CLI with a straightforward `gorilla` followed by your command in plain English.For instance, to list all files in the current directory, type:```bash$ gorilla I want to list all files in the current directory```or if you prefer, you can use quotes to avoid issues with string parsing:```bash$ gorilla &quot;I want to list all files in the current directory&quot; ```Gorilla CLI will then generate potential commands. Simply use the arrow keys to navigate through the options, then press enter to execute the chosen command. ```ü¶ç  Welcome to Gorilla. Use arrows to select ¬ª ls   ls -l   ls -al```## How It WorksGorilla-CLI fuses the capabilities of various Language Learning Models (LLMs) like [Gorilla LLM](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/), OpenAI's GPT-4, Claude v1, and others to present a user-friendly command-line interface. For each user query, we gather responses from all contributing LLMs, filter, sort, and present you with the most relevant options. ## ContributionsWe welcome your enhancements to Gorilla CLI! If you have improvements, feel free to submit a pull request on our GitHub page. ## LicenseGorilla CLI operates under the Apache 2.0 license. More details can be found in the LICENSE file. We'd also like to extend our appreciation to [questionary](https://github.com/tmbo/questionary) for their fantastic UI!</longdescription>
