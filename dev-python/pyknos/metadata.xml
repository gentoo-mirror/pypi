It either wraps orimplements diverse conditional density estimators.### Density estimation with normalizing flowsThis package provides pass-through access to all thefunctionalities of [nflows](https://github.com/bayesiains/nflows).## SetupClone the repo and install all the dependencies using the`environment.yml` file to create a conda environment: `conda envcreate -f environment.yml`. If you already have a `pyknos` environmentand want to refresh dependencies, just run `conda env update -fenvironment.yml --prune`.Alternatively, you can install via `setup.py` using `pip install -e&quot;.[dev]&quot;` (the dev flag installs development and testingdependencies).## ExamplesExamples are collected in notebooks in `examples/`.## Binary files and Jupyter notebooks### UsingWe use git lfs to store large binary files. Those files are notdownloaded by cloning the repository, but you have to pull themseparately. To do so follow installation instructions here[https://git-lfs.github.com/](https://git-lfs.github.com/). Inparticular, in a freshly cloned repository on a new machine, you willneed to run both `git-lfs install` and `git-lfs pull`.### ContributingWe use a filename filter to identify large binary files. Once youinstalled and pulled git lfs you can add a file to git lfs byappending `_gitlfs` to the basename, e.g., `oldbase_gitlfs.npy`. Thenadd the file to the index, commit, and it will be tracked by git lfs.Additionally, to avoid large diffs due to Jupyter notebook outputs weare using `nbstripout` to remove output from notebooks before everycommit. The `nbstripout` package is downloaded automatically duringinstallation of `pyknos`. However, **please make sure to set up thefilter yourself**, e.g., through `nbstriout --install` or withdifferent options as described[here](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout).## Namepyknós (πυκνός) is the transliterated Greek root for density(pyknótita) and also means *sagacious*.## Copyright noticeThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modifyit under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or(at your option) any later version.This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty ofMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
