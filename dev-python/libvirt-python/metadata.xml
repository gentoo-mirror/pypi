	<longdescription>Libvirt Python Binding README=============================This package provides a module that permits applicationswritten in the Python 3.x programming language to call the interfacesupplied by the libvirt library, to manage the virtualizationcapabilities of recent versions of Linux (and other OSes).As such, the module exposes Python bindings to to the libvirt.so,libvirt-qemu.so and libvirt-lxc.so library APIs.It is written to build against any version of libvirt thatis 0.9.11 or newer.This code is distributed under the terms of the LGPL version2 or later.Requirements------------To build the libvirt python binary requires the GCC and pkg-configtools, and development headers for the libvirt and python libraries.Building and installing-----------------------The module can be built by following the normal python modulebuild process  $ python3 -m buildfor testing and distributing purposes or it can be installed directly via pipas  $ python3 -m pip install .without explicit building.In order to test the package, you'll need either tox or at least pytest,depending on whether you want to test an already installed package in whichcase the latter is sufficient or if you wish to test in a virtualenvironment you'd need tox. Depending on your preferred setup, you can run thetests either as  $ python3 -m pytestor as  $ toxA makefile shim is also provided for your convenience, so that you don't haveto care about the exact operations mentioned above and instead you simply do  $ make &amp;&amp; make checkAs of libvirt 1.2.6, it is possible to develop against an uninstalledlibvirt.git checkout, by setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATHenvironment variables to point into that libvirt tree; you can evenautomate this by using libvirt's run script:  /path/to/libvirt/run python3 -m buildPatches for this code should be submitted as merge requests to theproject page on gitlab. See CONTRIBUTING.rst for more information.</longdescription>
