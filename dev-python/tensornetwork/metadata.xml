This can be useful for debugging, as all error messages will print the name of the broken edge/node.```pythonnode = tn.Node(np.eye(2), name=&quot;Identity Matrix&quot;)print(&quot;Name of node: {}&quot;.format(node.name))edge = tn.connect(node[0], node[1], name=&quot;Trace Edge&quot;)print(&quot;Name of the edge: {}&quot;.format(edge.name))# Adding name to a contraction will add the name to the new edge created.final_result = tn.contract(edge, name=&quot;Trace Of Identity&quot;)print(&quot;Name of new node after contraction: {}&quot;.format(final_result.name))```## Named axes.To make remembering what an axis does easier, you can optionally name a node's axes.```pythona = tn.Node(np.zeros((2, 2)), axis_names=[&quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;beta&quot;])edge = a[&quot;beta&quot;] ^ a[&quot;alpha&quot;]```## Edge reordering.To assert that your result's axes are in the correct order, you can reorder a node at any time during computation.```pythona = tn.Node(np.zeros((1, 2, 3)))e1 = a[0]e2 = a[1]e3 = a[2]a.reorder_edges([e3, e1, e2])# If you already know the axis values, you can equivalently do# a.reorder_axes([2, 0, 1])print(a.tensor.shape) # Should print (3, 1, 2)```## NCON interface.For a more compact specification of a tensor network and its contraction, there is `ncon()`. For example:```pythonfrom tensornetwork import ncona = np.ones((2, 2))b = np.ones((2, 2))c = ncon([a, b], [(-1, 1), (1, -2)])print(c)```## Different backend support.Currently, we support JAX, TensorFlow, PyTorch and NumPy as TensorNetwork backends.We also support tensors with Abelian symmetries via a `symmetric` backend, see the [referencedocumentation](https://tensornetwork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/block_sparse_tutorial.html) for more details.To change the default global backend, you can do:```pythontn.set_default_backend(&quot;jax&quot;) # tensorflow, pytorch, numpy, symmetric```Or, if you only want to change the backend for a single `Node`, you can do:```pythontn.Node(tensor, backend=&quot;jax&quot;)```If you want to run your contractions on a GPU, we highly recommend using JAX, as it has the closet API to NumPy.## DisclaimerThis library is in *alpha* and will be going through a lot of breaking changes. While releases will be stable enough for research, we do not recommend using this in any production environment yet.TensorNetwork is not an official Google product.
