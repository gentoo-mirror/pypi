	<longdescription># CSR Matrices for Python[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/lenskit/csr/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=6UQ4O8FCKK)](https://codecov.io/gh/lenskit/csr)This package provides an implementation of sparse matrices in compressed sparserow format for Python. Routines are implemented with Numba, and both the CSRdata structure and most related matrix and vector operations can be used fromNumba's nopython mode.Right now the feature set is very limited --- don't expect this to be a drop-inreplacement for SciPy's sparse matrices.  Some features we expect to develop aspeople take an interest in the package and contribute updates, but we also hopeto keep a relatively tight scope.  This package aims to provide efficient supportfor compressed sparse row matrices, with some routines that can also treat themas CSC matrices.</longdescription>
