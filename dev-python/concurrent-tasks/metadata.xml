It will have its own event loop.Under the hook, `ThreadSafeTaskPool` is used.Parameters:- `name` will be used as the thread's name.- `size` and `timeout` see `ThreadSafeTaskPool`.- `context_manager` can be optional context managers that will be entered when the loop has startedand exited before the loop is stopped.&gt; üí° All tasks will be completed when the pool is stopped.&gt; üí° Blocking and async version are the same, prefer the async version if client code is async.### Loop initialization&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è Asyncio primitives need to be instantiated with the proper event loop.To achieve that, use a context manager wrapping instantiation of objects:```pythonfrom functools import partialfrom concurrent_tasks import ThreadedPoolContextManagerWrapper, AsyncThreadedTaskPoolpool = AsyncThreadedTaskPool(context_manager=ThreadedPoolContextManagerWrapper(partial(MyObj, ...)))```### BlockingThis can be used to run async functions in a dedicated event loop, while keeping it running to handle background tasksExample usage:```pythonfrom concurrent_tasks import BlockingThreadedTaskPoolasync def func():    ...with BlockingThreadedTaskPool() as pool:    # Create and run the task.    result = pool.run(func())    # Create a task, the `concurrent.Future` will hold information about completion.    future = pool.create_task(func())```### AsyncThreads can be useful in cooperation with asyncio to let the OS guarantee fair resource distribution between threads.This is especially useful in case you cannot know if called code will properly cooperate with the event loop.Example usage:```pythonfrom concurrent_tasks import AsyncThreadedTaskPoolasync def func():    ...async with AsyncThreadedTaskPool() as pool:    # Create and run the task.    result = await pool.run(func())    # Create a task, the asyncio.Future will hold information about completion.    future = pool.create_task(func())```## Restartable taskTask that can be started and cancelled multiple times until it can finally be completed.This is useful to handle pauses and retries when handling with a connection.&gt; üí° Use `functools.partial` to pass parameters to the function.Example usage:```pythonfrom functools import partialfrom concurrent_tasks import RestartableTaskasync def send(data): ...task: RestartableTask[int] = RestartableTask(partial(send, b&quot;\x00&quot;), timeout=1)task.start()assert await task == 1# Running in other tasks:# On connection lost:task.cancel()# On connection resumed:task.start()# On response received:task.set_result(1)```</longdescription>
