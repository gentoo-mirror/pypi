The student can click through two states of the XBlock,shown below:| |mark|| |undo|.. |mark| image:: completionxblock_mark.png.. |undo| image:: completionxblock_undo.pngThis can be useful for activities that are self directed or where completion is ambiguous.Getting Started===============You can see the DoneXBlock in action in the XBlock Workbench.  Running the Workbench requires having docker running... code:: bash  git clone git@github.com:openedx/DoneXBlock  virtualenv venv/DoneXBlock/  source venv/DoneXBlock/activate  make upgrade  make install  make dev.runYou can interact with the DoneXBlock in the Workbench by navigating to http://localhost:8000For details regarding how to deploy this or any other XBlock in the lms instance, see the `installing-the-xblock`_ documentation... _installing-the-xblock: https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/xblock-tutorial/en/latest/edx_platform/devstack.html#installing-the-xblockGetting Help============If you're having trouble, we have discussion forums athttps://discuss.openedx.org where you can connect with others in thecommunity.Our real-time conversations are on Slack. You can request a `Slackinvitation`_, then join our `community Slack workspace`_.For anything non-trivial, the best path is to open an issue in thisrepository with as many details about the issue you are facing as youcan provide.https://github.com/openedx/DoneXBlock/issuesFor more information about these options, see the `Getting Help`_ page... _Slack invitation: https://openedx.org/slack.. _community Slack workspace: https://openedx.slack.com/.. _Getting Help: https://openedx.org/getting-helpHow to Contribute=================Details about how to become a contributor to the Open edX project maybe found in the wiki at `How to contribute`_.. _How to contribute: https://openedx.org/r/how-to-contributeThe Open edX Code of Conduct----------------------------All community members should familarize themselves with the `Open edX Code of Conduct`_... _Open edX Code of Conduct: https://openedx.org/code-of-conduct/People======The assigned maintainers for this component and other project detailsmay be found in `Backstage`_ or groked from inspecting catalog-info.yaml... _Backstage: https://open-edx-backstage.herokuapp.com/catalog/default/component/DoneXBlockReporting Security Issues=========================Please do not report security issues in public. Please email security@edx.org.History=======FutureLearn uses this kind of thing to great effect. Students can readtext, watch videos, etc., and indicate when their done. This isconvenient both for progress indication to the student (know whatthey've done, and for honor code grading (indicating to us that theybelieve they've finished an activity).I copied some of the UX patterns from FutureLearn so that users ofboth platforms would have consistency of user experience betweenMOOCs. I didn't copy them exactly since I wanted to be unambiguously in the clear with IP issues around look-and-feel, and this was on a shortanough timeline that I did not have a chance to reach out toFutureLearn for permission. As a footnote, this kind of collaborationbetween MOOC providers is probably worth pursuing -- it'd be to thebenefit of learners on all platforms, and ultimately, the industry asa whole if we had consistency of experience between platforms whereconvenient.</longdescription>
