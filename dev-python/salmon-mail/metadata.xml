Salmon is designed to sitbehind a traditional mail server in the same way a web application sits behindApache or Nginx. It has all the features of a web application stack (templates,routing, handlers, state machine) and plays well with other libraries, such asDjango and SQLAlchemy.Salmon has been released uner the GNU GPLv3, as published by the FSF.Features========Salmon supports running in many contexts for processing mail using the besttechnology currently available. Since Salmon is aiming to be a modern mailserver and Mail processing framework, it has some features you don't find inany other Mail server.- Written in portable Python that should run on almost any Unix server.- Handles mail in almost any encoding and format, including attachments, and  canonicalizes them for easier processing.- Sends nearly pristine clean mail that is easier to process by other  receiving servers.- Properly decodes internationalized mail into Python unicode, and translates  Python unicode back into nice clean ascii and/or UTF-8 mail.- Supports working with Maildir queues to defer work and distribute it to  multiple machines.- Can run as an non-root user on privileged ports to reduce the risk of  intrusion.- Salmon can also run in a completely separate virtualenv for easy deployment.- A flexible and easy to use routing system lets you write stateful or state\  *less* handlers of your email.- Ability to use Jinja2 or Mako templates to craft emails including the  headers.- Easily configurable to use alternative sending and receiving systems,  database libraries, or any other systems you need to talk to.- Yet, you don't *have* to configure everything to get stated. A simple  ``salmon gen`` command lets you get an application up and running quick.- Finally, many helpful commands for general mail server debugging and  cleaning.Installing==========``pip install salmon-mail``Project Information===================Project documentation can be found`here &lt;http://salmon-mail.readthedocs.org/&gt;`__Fork----Salmon is a fork of Lamson. In the summer of 2012 (2012-07-13 to be exact),Lamson was relicensed under a BSD variant that was revokable.  The two clausesthat were of most concern::    4. Contributors agree that any contributions are owned by the copyright holder    and that contributors have absolutely no rights to their contributions.    5. The copyright holder reserves the right to revoke this license on anyone who    uses this copyrighted work at any time for any reason.I read that to mean that I could make a contribution but then have said workdenied to me because the orginal author didn't like the colour of my socks. SoI went and found the latest version that was available under the GNU GPLversion 3.Salmon is an anagram of Lamson, if you hadn't worked it out already.Source------You can find the source on GitHub:https://github.com/moggers87/salmonStatus------Salmon has just had some major changes to modernise the code-base. The mainAPIs should be compatible with releases prior to 3.0.0, but there's noguarantee that older applications won't need changes.Python versions supported are: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.See the CHANGELOG for more details on what's changed since version 2.License-------Salmon is released under the GNU GPLv3 license, which can be found `here&lt;https://github.com/moggers87/salmon/blob/master/LICENSE&gt;`__Contributing------------Pull requests and issues are most welcome. Please read our `code of conduct&lt;https://github.com/moggers87/salmon/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md&gt;`__ beforecontributing!I will not accept code that has been submitted for inclusion in the originalproject due to the terms of its new licence.Code Of Conduct---------------The Salmon project has adopted the Contributor Covenant Code version 1.4. Bycontributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.The full text of the code of conduct can be found `here&lt;https://github.com/moggers87/salmon/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md&gt;`__Testing=======The Salmon project needs unit tests, code reviews, coverage information, sourceanalysis, and security reviews to maintain quality. If you find a bug, pleasetake the time to write a test case that fails or provide a piece of mail thatcauses the failure.If you contribute new code then your code should have as much coverage aspossible, with a minimal amount of mocking.Tests can be run via::    $ python setup.py testAlternatively, if you have multiple versions of Python installed locally::    $ pip install tox    $ tox -e py27,py36Refer to the `tox documentation &lt;https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`__ formore information.Development===========Salmon is written entirely in Python and runs on Python 2.7 with experimentalsupport for Python 3. It should hopefully run on any platform that supportsPython and has Unix semantics.If you find yourself lost in source code, just yell.PEP-8 should be followed where possible, but feel free to ignore the 80character limit it imposes (120 is a good marker IMO)... inclusion-marker-do-not-remove-endFunding=======If you have found Salmon to be useful and would like to see its continueddevelopment, please consider `buying me a coffee&lt;https://ko-fi.com/moggers87&gt;`__... |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/moggers87/salmon.svg?branch=master   :alt: Build Status   :scale: 100%   :target: https://travis-ci.org/moggers87/salmon.. |Coverage| image:: https://codecov.io/github/moggers87/salmon/coverage.svg?branch=master   :target: https://codecov.io/github/moggers87/salmon   :alt: Coverage Status   :scale: 100%.. |docs| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/salmon-mail/badge/?version=latest   :alt: Documentation Status   :scale: 100%   :target: https://salmon-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest</longdescription>
