	<longdescription># dj-inmemorystorage[![image](https://travis-ci.org/waveaccounting/dj-inmemorystorage.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/waveaccounting/dj-inmemorystorage)[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/dj-inmemorystorage.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dj-inmemorystorage)An in-memory data storage backend for Django.Compatible with Django's [storageAPI](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/files/storage/).# Supported Versions  - Python 2.7 with Django 1.11  - Python 3.5/3.6/3.7 with Django 1.11+  - Python 3.8 with Django 2.2+In general, we follow [Python's supportedversions](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches) and[Django's supportedversions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/faq/install/#what-python-version-can-i-use-with-django).Any major change in version support will be released as a new majorversion.# UsageIn your test settings file, add``` pythonDEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'inmemorystorage.InMemoryStorage'```By default, the `InMemoryStorage` backend is non-persistant, meaningthat writes to it from one section of your code will not be present whenreading from another section of your code, unless both are sharing thesame instance of the storage backend.If you need your storage to persist, you can add the following to yoursettings.``` pythonINMEMORYSTORAGE_PERSIST = True```# DifferencesThis library is based on[django-inmemorystorage](https://github.com/codysoyland/django-inmemorystorage)by Cody Soyland, with[modifications](https://github.com/SeanHayes/django-inmemorystorage)made by Se√°n Hayes with support for the `url` method, with [additionalsupport](https://github.com/Vostopia/django-inmemorystorage) from ToreBirkeland for writing to the file.Wave's modifications include packaging, and test modifications such that`python setup.py test` works. This version also bumps the version to`1.0.0` and renames it to dj-inmemorystorage such that it doesn'tconflict on PyPI.The biggest difference is that this package works with Django 1.4 now(previously only 1.5+). It also supports Python 2.6/2.7 with Django1.4+, Python 3.2/3.3/3.4 with Django 1.5+ and Python 3.5/3.6 with Django1.7+.# Contributing1.  Ensure that you open a pull request2.
