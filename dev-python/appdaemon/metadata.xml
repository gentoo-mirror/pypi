	<longdescription># DescriptionAppDaemon is a loosely coupled, multi-threaded, sandboxed pythonexecution environment for writing automation apps for various types of Home Automation Software including [HomeAssistant](https://home-assistant.io/) and MQTT. It has a pluggable architecture allowing it to be integrated withpractically any event driven application.It also provides a configurable dashboard (HADashboard)suitable for wall mounted tablets.## Getting startedFor full instructions on installation and usage check out the [AppDaemon Project Documentation](http://appdaemon.readthedocs.io).## Release Cycle FrequencyAppDaemon has reached a very stable point, works reliably and is fairly feature rich at this pointin its development. For that reason, releases have been slow in recent months. This does not mean that AppDaemon has been abandoned - it is used every day by the core developers and has an active discord server [here](https://discord.gg/qN7c7JcFjk) - please join us for tipsand tricks, AppDaemon discussions and general home automation.## ContributingThis is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to use the code or contribute to it. Thank you for being involved!Have a look at the [official documentation](https://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/DEV.html) for more information.</longdescription>
