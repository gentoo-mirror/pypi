	<longdescription>============================================================Phasepack: a toolkit for phase-based image feature detection============================================================This toolkit consists of a set of functions which use information containedwithin the phase of a Fourier-transformed image to detect localised featuressuch as edges, blobs and corners. These methods have the key advantage that theproperties they measure are invariant with respect to image brightness andcontrast.:phasecong:Phase congruency using oriented filters:phasecongmono:Fast phase congruency using monogenic filters:phasesym:Phase symmetry using oriented filters:phasesymmono:Fast phase symmetry using monogenic filtersFor more information on a particular function, see the associated docstring andthe references therein.Installation-------------::$ python setup.py installFast(er) Fourier Transforms---------------------------All of the functions in this module make use of the Fast Fourier Transform(FFT), and their speed significantly depends on the module used to provide FFTfunctions. If it is available, the `pyFFTW&lt;http://hgomersall.github.io/pyFFTW/&gt;`_ module will be used. This providesPython bindings to the FFTW C library, and is substantially faster than``fftpack``, the default for scipy.To install pyFFTW:::$ pip install pyfftwAuthorship----------These functions were originally written for MATLAB by Peter Kovesi, andwere ported to Python by Alistair Muldal. The original MATLAB code, as well asfurther explanatory information and references are available from `PeterKovesi's website&lt;http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~pk/Research/MatlabFns/index.html#phasecong&gt;`_.MIT License-----------Permission is hereby  granted, free of charge, to any  person obtaining a copyof this software and associated  documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to dealin the Software without restriction, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.
