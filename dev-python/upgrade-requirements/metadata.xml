	<longdescription>upgrade-requirements.py=======================[![Current version on PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/upgrade-requirements.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/upgrade-requirements/)Upgrade all your outdated `requirements.txt` in a single command.Motivation----------Even though `pip list --outdated` exists, sometimes you just want torun `pip install --upgrade` to upgrade a package, then persist it toyour `requirements.txt` in one big sweep.Installation------------```bash$ pip install upgrade-requirements```Usage-----```bash$ upgrade-requirements```(Or use the shortcut command `upreq`.)Now's a good time to grab a â˜• while it runs.After it finishes, run your tests to make sure an individual upgrade didn'tbreak anything. Then move on to bigger things ðŸš€#### Found a problem with an upgraded version?No worries!1. Revert individual entries in `requirements.txt` with the help of git2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to downgrade to working versions3. Commit the upgraded-and-tweaked `requirements.txt` like normal and carry on ðŸŽ‰#### More usages```bash$ upgrade-requirements -h``````usage: upgrade-requirements [-h] [-r REQUIREMENTS]optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -r REQUIREMENTS, --requirements REQUIREMENTS                        specify the location of the requirements.txt file```Room for improvement--------------------- This only work with pinned (`==`) packages at the moment. The intention is to  get it to work more generally. This can be broken down into three sub-tasks:  - Get it to ignore non-pinned requirements instead of fail  - Get it to work with other specifiers, e.g. `&gt;=` (how would this work?)  - Handle all types of requirement entriesFeel free to open an issue or PR with ideas.</longdescription>
