Module for instrument communication via SCPI, implemented using pyvisa and pyserial (depending on the device)## Features- Communicate with devices over GPIB, RS232, or USB via SCPI protocol- Several common instruments (Agilent 33210A, Keithley 2400 sourcemeter) already have dedicated classes- Create new instruments with the SCPIDevice class## Getting Started### InstallationThis package can be installed directly with pip from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/scippy/): ```pip install scippy```### Agilent ExampleThe following example sets the frequency, amplitude, and output state of an Agilent 33210A instrument, and verifies that the parameters match the ones you set.```from scippy import Agilentagilent = Agilent()agilent.frequency = 2500agilent.amplitude = 0.5agilent.output_on = Trueagilent.verify()```### Keithley ExampleThe following sets up a Keithley 2400 source meter, sets the voltage compliance, and sets a current```from scippy import Keithley, uregkeithley = Keithley()keithley.current = 0.05 # Units assumed to be in Ampskeithley.voltage_compliance = 25 * ureg.mV # Set compliance to 25mVvoltage, current = keithley.measure() # Sets the output on, measures the current and voltageprint(voltage)print(current)```### Common Issues (Keithley)Some instruments, unfortunately, have much less reliable communication interfaces than others. In particular, the Keithley is extremely sensitive to not being closed.</longdescription>
