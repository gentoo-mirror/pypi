Forexample to update the increment the patch version use```bashbumpversion patch```## To run tests```pytest```## Supported Python versionsnwa-stdlib must support the same python versions as [orchestrator-core](https://github.com/workfloworchestrator/orchestrator-core).Exceptions to this rule are:* **A new python version is released:** nwa-stdlib should support the new version before orchestrator-core does* **Support for an old python version is dropped:** nwa-stdlib should drop the python version after orchestrator-core does</longdescription>
