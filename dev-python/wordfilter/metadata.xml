	<longdescription># wordfilterA small module meant for use in text generators. It lets you filter strings for bad words.## Getting StartedInstall the module with: `npm install wordfilter````javascriptvar wordfilter = require('wordfilter');wordfilter.blacklisted('does this string have a bad word in it?'); // &quot;false&quot;// clear the list entirelywordfilter.clearList();// add new wordswordfilter.addWords(['zebra','elephant']);wordfilter.blacklisted('this string has zebra in it'); // &quot;true&quot;// remove a wordwordfilter.removeWord('zebra');wordfilter.blacklisted('this string has zebra in it'); // &quot;false&quot;```Or with Python:Install the module with: `pip install wordfilter````pythonfrom wordfilter import Wordfilterwordfilter = Wordfilter()wordfilter.blacklisted('does this string have a bad word in it?')  # False# clear the list entirelywordfilter.clearList()# add new wordswordfilter.addWords(['zebra','elephant'])wordfilter.blacklisted('this string has zebra in it')  # True```## DocumentationThis is a word filter adapted from code that I use in a lot of my twitter bots. It is based on [a list of words that I've hand-picked](https://github.com/dariusk/wordfilter/blob/master/lib/badwords.json) for exclusion from my bots: essentially, it's a list of things that I would not say myself. Generally speaking, they are &quot;words of oppression&quot;, aka racist/sexist/ableist things that I would not say.The list is not all-inclusive, and I'm always adding words to it. If you'd like to file an issue or a pull request to add more words, please do so, but understand that this is primarily for use in my own projects, and I may not agree to add certain words. (For example, I have no problem with scatological words, so &quot;shit&quot; and &quot;fuck&quot; will never be on this list.)Words are case insensitive.Also note that due to the complexities of the English language, I am considering anything containing the substring of a bad word to be blacklisted. For example, even though &quot;homogenous&quot; is not a bad word, it contains the substring &quot;homo&quot; and it gets filtered. The reason for this is that new slang pops up all the time using compound words and I can't possibly keep up with it. I'm willing to lose a few words like &quot;homogenous&quot; and &quot;Pakistan&quot; in order to avoid false negatives.## ContributingIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
