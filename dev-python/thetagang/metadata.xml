The Wheelis a strategy that [surfaced onReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/),but has been used by many in the past. This bot implements a slightlymodified version of The Wheel, with my own personal tweaks.I've been streaming most of the work on this project [on Twitch, so follow meover there](https://www.twitch.tv/letsmakestuff).## How it worksStart by reading [the Redditpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/)to get some background.The strategy, as implemented here, does a few things differently from the onedescribed in the post above. For one, it's intended to be used to augment atypical index-fund based portfolio with specific asset allocations. Forexample, you might want to use a 60/40 portfolio with SPY (S&amp;P500 fund) andTLT (20 year treasury fund). This strategy reduces risk, but may also limitgains from big market swings. By reducing risk, one can increase leverage.The main difference between ThetaGang and simply buying and holding indexfunds is that this script will attempt to harvest volatility by sellingoptions, rather than buying shares directly. This works because impliedvolatility is typically higher than realized volatility on average. Insteadof buying shares, you write puts. This has pros and cons, which are outsidethe scope of this README.You could use this tool on individual stocks, but I personally don'trecommend it because I am not smart enough to understand which stocks to buy.That's why I just buy index funds.ThetaGang will try to acquire your desired allocation of each stock or ETFaccording to the weights you specify in the config. To acquire the positions,the script will write puts when conditions are met (config parameters, adequatebuying power, acceptable contracts are available, enough shares needed, etc).ThetaGang will continue to roll any open option positions indefinitely, with theonly exception being ITM puts (although this is configurable). Once puts are inthe money, they will be ignored until they expire and are exercised (after whichyou will own the underlying). When rolling puts, the strike of the new contractsare capped at the old strike plus the premium received (to prevent your accountfrom blowing due to over-ratcheting up the buying power usage).If puts are exercised due to being ITM at expiration, you will own thestock, and ThetaGang switches from writing puts to writing calls at a strikeat least as high as the average cost of the stock held.Please note: this strategy is based on the assumption that implied volatilityis, on average, always higher than realized volatility. In cases where thisis not true, this strategy will cause you to lose money.In the case of deep ITM calls, the bot will prefer to roll the calls to nextstrike or expiration rather than allowing the underlying to get called away. If youdon't have adequate buying power available in your account, it's possiblethat the options may get exercised instead of rolling forward and the processstarts back at the beginning. Please keep in mind this may have taximplications, but that is outside the scope of this README.In normal usage, you would run the script as a cronjob on a daily, weekly, ormonthly basis according to your preferences. Running more frequently thandaily is not recommended, but the choice is yours.![Paper account sample output](sample.png)### VIX call hedgingThetaGang can optionally hedge your account by purchasing VIX calls for thenext month based on specified parameters. The strategy is based on the [CboeVIX Tail Hedge Index](https://www.cboe.com/us/indices/dashboard/vxth/), whichyou can read about on the internet. You can enable this feature in `thetagang.toml` with:```toml[vix_call_hedge]enabled = true```Default values are provided, based on the VXTH index, but you may configurethem to your taste (refer to[`thetagang.toml`](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang/blob/6eab3823120c10c0563e02c5d7f30dfcc0e333fc/thetagang.toml#L294-L331)for details).Buying VIX calls is not free, and it _will_ create some drag on your portfolio,but in times of extreme volatility–such as the COVID-related 2020 marketpanic–VIX calls can provide outsized returns.### Cash managementAt the time of writing, interest rates have reached yields that make bonds lookattractive. To squeeze a little more juice, thetagang can do some simple cashmanagement by purchasing a fund when you have extra cash. Although you do earna yield on your cash balance, it's not the juiciest yield you can get, so alittle optimization might help you earn 1 or 2 extra pennies to take the edgeoff your rent payments.There are quite a few ETFs that might be a decent place to stash your cash, andyou should do some internet searches to find the most appropriate one for youand your feelings. Here are some internet web searches that you can test out toget some information on cash funds (ETFs):- [&quot;cash etf reddit&quot;](https://www.google.com/search?q=cash+etf+reddit)- [&quot;sgov reddit&quot;](https://www.google.com/search?q=sgov+reddit)- [&quot;shv reddit&quot;](https://www.google.com/search?q=shv+reddit)- [&quot;short term government bond etf reddit&quot;](https://www.google.com/search?q=short+term+government+bond+etf+reddit)You can enable cash management with:```toml[cash_management]enabled = true```Refer to [`thetagang.toml`](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang/blob/4fc34653786ec17fe6ce6ec2406b2d861277f934/thetagang.toml#L330-L377) for all the options.## Project statusThis project is, in its current state, considered to be complete. I'm opento contributions, but I am unlikely to accept PRs or feature requests thatinvolve significant changes to the underlying algorithm.If you find something that you think is a bug, or some other issue, please[create a new issue](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang/issues/new).## &quot;Show me your gains bro&quot; – i.e., what are the returns?As discussed elsewhere in this README, you must conduct your own research, andI suggest starting with resources such as CBOE's BXM and BXDM indices andcomparing those to SPX. I've had a lot of people complain because &quot;thatstrategy isn't better than buy and hold BRUH&quot;–let me assure you, that is not mygoal with this.There are conflicting opinions about whether selling options is good or bad,more or less risky, yadda yadda, but generally, the risk profile for coveredcalls and naked puts is no worse than the worst case for simply holding anETF or stock. I'd argue that selling a naked put is better thanbuying SPY with a limit order, because at least if SPY goes to zero you keepthe premium from selling the option. The main downside is that returns arecapped on the upside. Depending on your goals, this may not matter. If you'relike me, then you'd rather have consistent returns and give up a little bitof potential upside.Generally speaking, the point of selling options is not to exceed the returnsof the underlying, but rather to reduce risk. Reducing risk is an importantfeature because it, in turn, allows one to increase risk in other ways(i.e., allocate a higher percentage to stocks or buy riskier assets).Whether you use this or not is up to you. I have not one single fuck to give,whether you use it or not. I am not here to convince you to use it, I merelywant to share knowledge and perhaps help create a little bit of wealthredistribution.💫## RequirementsThe bot is based on the [ib_insync](https://github.com/erdewit/ib_insync)library, and uses [IBC](https://github.com/IbcAlpha/IBC) for managing the APIgateway.To use the bot, you'll need an Interactive Brokers account with a workinginstallation of IBC. If you want to modify the bot, you'll need aninstallation of Python 3.8 or newer with the[`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) package manager.One more thing: to run this on a live account, you'll require enough capitalto purchase at least 100 shares of the stocks or ETFs you choose. Forexample, if SPY is trading at $300/share you'd need $30,000 available. Youcan search for lower priced alternatives, but these tend to have low volumeon options which may not be appropriate for this strategy. You shouldgenerally avoid low volume ETFs/stocks. If you don't have that kind ofcapital, you'll need to keep renting out your time to the capitalists untilyou can become a capitalist yourself. That's the way the pyramid scheme wecall capitalism works.## Installation_Before running ThetaGang, you should set up an IBKR paper account to test thecode._```consolepip install thetagang```It's recommended you familiarize yourself with[IBC](https://github.com/IbcAlpha/IBC) so you know how it works. You'll needto know how to configure the various knows and settings, and make sure thingslike API ports are configured correctly. If you don't want to mess around toomuch, consider [running ThetaGang with Docker](#running-with-docker).## Usage```consolethetagang -h```## Up and running with DockerMy preferred way for running ThetaGang is to use a cronjob to execute Dockercommands. I've built a Docker image as part of this project, which you canuse with your installation. There's a [prebuilt Docker imagehere](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/brndnmtthws/thetagang).To run ThetaGang within Docker, you'll need to pass `config.ini` for [IBCconfiguration](https://github.com/IbcAlpha/IBC/blob/master/userguide.md) and[`thetagang.toml`](/thetagang.toml) for ThetaGang. There's a sample[`ibc-config.ini`](/ibc-config.ini) included in this repo for your convenience.The easiest way to get the config files into the container is by mounting avolume.To get started, grab a copy of `thetagang.toml` and `config.ini`:```consolemkdir ~/thetagangcd ~/thetagangcurl -Lq https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang/main/thetagang.toml -o ./thetagang.tomlcurl -Lq https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang/main/ibc-config.ini -o ./config.ini```Edit `~/thetagang/thetagang.toml` to suit your needs. Pay particularattention to the symbols and weights. At a minimum, you must change theusername, password, and account number. You may also want to change thetrading move from paper to live when needed.Now, to run ThetaGang with Docker:```consoledocker run --rm -i --net host \    -v ~/thetagang:/etc/thetagang \    brndnmtthws/thetagang:main \    --config /etc/thetagang/thetagang.toml```Lastly, to run ThetaGang as a daily cronjob Monday to Friday at 9am, addsomething like this to your crontab (on systems with a cron installation, use`crontab -e` to edit your crontab):```crontab0 9 * * 1-5 docker run --rm -i -v ~/thetagang:/etc/thetagang brndnmtthws/thetagang:main --config /etc/thetagang/thetagang.toml```## Determining which ETFs or stocks to run ThetaGang withI leave this as an exercise to the reader, however I will provide a fewrecommendations and resources:### Recommendations- Stick with high volume ETFs or stocks- Careful with margin usage, you'll want to calculate the worst case scenario  and provide plenty of cushion for yourself based on your portfolio### Resources- For discussions about selling options, check out  [r/thetagang](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/)- For backtesting portfolios, you can use [this  tool](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio) and [this  tool](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/optimize-portfolio) to get an idea  of drawdown and typical volatility## DevelopmentCheck out the code to your local machine and install the Python dependencies:```consolepoetry installpoetry run autohooks activatepoetry run thetagang -h```You are now ready to make a splash! 🐳## FAQ| Error | Cause | Resolution ||---|---|---|| Requested market data is not subscribed. | Requisite market data subscriptions have not been set up on IBKR. | [Configure](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/am3/am/settings/marketdatasubscriptions.htm) your market data subscriptions.
