	<longdescription>Medlemssys==========Medlemssys is a membership register.  Primarily written for norwegian youthorganizations, but can and is used by other kinds of organizations.It doesn't do anything very advanced, but provides a way to list the members,export to CSV, can read OCR-files, send emails and some more.Installation------------Doing a simple install, you can install &quot;medlemssys&quot; for a test version, or&quot;medlemssys[production]&quot; to get a few required extras for a real setup::    pip install medlemssys[production]You'll use the `medlemssys` command for all commands.  It's a small wrapperaround the django-admin command.  The first thing you'll want to do is tocreate a settings file::    medlemssys initThis will give you a `medlemssys_conf.py` file.  Have a look at it, and changewhat you need.  You should load in the data to the database and create yourselfa user::    medlemssys migrate    medlemssys createsuperuserIf you chose the production setup, you can run gunicorn using a handy wrapper::    medlemssys gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000You can of course also try the django development server to just test yourregister::    medlemssys runserver 0.0.0.0:8000</longdescription>
