	<longdescription># Shell Craft[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/openai-shell-craft?color=green&amp;label=PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/openai-shell-craft/)Generating shell commands and code using natural language models (OpenAI ChatGPT).## Install using Pip```shpip install openai-shell-craft```## Build from Docker and Run```shdocker build . --tag shell_craft --target shell_craftdocker run shell_craft --help```## Command Line InterfaceAll command line usage follows the following format:```bashshell-craft &lt;request&gt;```### Quick Start```shshell-craft &quot;tell me how long the system has been up for&quot;```Returns:```bashuptime -p```## Prompt TypesShell Craft supports many different `--prompt` options. We have organized them into categories here only to aid in reference usage.| Category      | Name                                                                  | Argument Value    ||---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|| Language      | [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)                            | `bash`            || Language      | [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)           | `powershell`      || Language      | [Python](https://www.python.org/)                                     | `python`          || Language      | [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))           | `c`               || Language      | [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)                | `c_sharp`         || Language      | [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) | `javascript`      || Language      | [Java](https://dev.java/)                                             | `java`            || Language      | [Go](https://go.dev/)                                                 | `go`              || Template      | Bug Report                                                            | `bug_report`      || Template      | Feature Request                                                       | `feature_request` |When `--prompt` is not specified, Shell Craft will use `bash` unless PowerShell is used to call Shell Craft, then it uses `powershell`.### Help PromptFor additional help you can run:```bashshell-craft --help```### Bash ExampleExecuting:```bashshell-craft --prompt bash &quot;find all swp files and delete them if theyre not in use&quot;```Returns a Bash command:```bashfind . -name '*.swp' -type f ! -exec fuser -s {} \; -delete```### Powershell ExampleExecuting:```ps1shell-craft --prompt powershell &quot;remove all files older than 30 days&quot;```Returns a PowerShell command:```ps1Get-ChildItem -Path &quot;C:\your\path&quot; -Recurse | Where-Object { $_.LastWriteTime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-30)} | Remove-Item -Force```### Refactoring existing code```bashcat my_code.py | python -m shell_craft --prompt python --refactor```### Documenting existing code```bashcat my_code.py | python -m shell_craft --prompt python --document```### Generating tests for existing code```bashcat my_code.py | python -m shell_craft --prompt python --test```### Feature Request ExampleExecuting:```shshell_craft --prompt feature_request &quot;add an icon that shows the total test coverage&quot;```Returns Markdown:```markdown---name: Add Total Test Coverage Iconabout: Add an icon that shows the total test coveragelabels: Enhancement---**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**There is currently no easy way to visualize the total test coverage for a project.**Describe the solution you'd like**I would like to have an icon on the project dashboard that, when clicked, displays the total test coverage for the project. This will allow developers to easily monitor and improve the overall test coverage for the project.**Describe alternatives you've considered**As an alternative, I have considered adding the total test coverage to the project README file. However, this solution would not be as easily accessible as an icon on the project dashboard.```## Language ModelsSupport for different [OpenAI models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).Currently recommended `--model` options:1. `gpt-3.5-turbo` (default)2. `gpt-4`3. `gpt-4-32k`4. `code-davinci-002`5. `text-davinci-003`If `--model` is not specified, it will use `gpt-3.5-turbo` by default.## Python APIThe following example shows how to use Shell Craft inside of your own Python code. The example loads your api key from an environment variable, uses the Bash prompt, and gets input from the user.```pythonimport osfrom shell_craft import Servicefrom shell_craft.prompts import BASH_PROMPTService(    api_key = os.environ.get(&quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;),    prompt = BASH_PROMPT,).query(    message = input(&quot;Enter your request: &quot;))```## API KeyShell Craft uses the OpenAI API to generate the shell commands, requiring an API key to give it access to an account with OpenAI._Warning! **API keys are sensitive information** and should be kept confidential. Don't share your API key with anyone who shouldn't have access to it. Failure to do so may result in charges on your OpenAI account. Shell Craft never transmits this key to any service other than the official OpenAI API. **Your API key** is **your responsibility**._To obtain an API key from the OpenAI platform, follow these steps:1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys in your web browser.2. Log in to your OpenAI account or create a new account if you don't have one.3. Click the &quot;Create new secret key&quot; button.4. Copy the key that is generated for you.Once you have your API key, you **must** pass it to Shell Craft via **one** of the following methods.### Option 1 (Recommended) - Configuration file:shell-craft looks for a configuration file in the following places, in order:  - the current directory, named config.json  - the file named by $SHELLCRAFT_CONFIG  - $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/shell-craft/config.json  - $HOME/.config/shell-craft/config.jsonThe contents are simple json:```{    &quot;openai_api_key&quot;: &quot;&lt;your secret key&gt;&quot;}```Now, Shell Craft will know your API key in order to run future prompts without having to specify it or ensure it exists in the environmental variables.### Option 2 - Command Line Argument:```bashshell-craft &quot;list all files in directory&quot; --api-key API_KEY```Where `API_KEY` is your OpenAI API key.### Option 3 - Environment Variable:```bashexport OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;your secret key&gt;shell-craft &quot;list all files in directory&quot;```Where `&lt;your secret key&gt;` is your OpenAI API key.## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.## AcknowledgmentsAcknowledgments contain a few of the people who have helped the project along the way.* [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for their language models and API.* [Joel Fourhman](https://github.com/joelfourhman) for the initial idea, the challenge, and the project name.* [Chase Montgomery](https://github.com/BLuFeNiX) for testing, feedback, and estimated time savings vs manual implementation.* [Bryan Gonzalez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-gonzalez-2b86ba67/) for powershell feedback and merge reviews.* [Aaron Croissette](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acrois/) for business use case feedback, documentation, and a lovely PyPi icon on the readme.</longdescription>
