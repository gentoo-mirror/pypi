	<longdescription># Upgrading from 2.x?The 3.0 update contains breaking changes: `poetry`, `mypy` and `black` are no longer distributed with `coveo-stew`.Please refer to the [upgrade guide](./README_UPGRADE.md#upgrading-from-2x-to-3x) for more information and resolution steps. # coveo-stewcoveo-stew delivers a complete Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) solutionusing [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) as its backend.## CI tools- Config-free pytest, mypy and black runners- Add your own linters and tools- JUnit report generation- GitHub Action that runs all your CI toolsSimilar to: tox## CD tools- GitHub Action for Continuous Delivery (CD) (publish to pypi)- Automated &quot;patch&quot; version bumps (requires a `pypi` server)- Can download locked dependencies into a folder, for offline distributionSimilar to: poetry, flit, pbr, setuptools## Multiple projects- Support for several isolated poetry projects in one GitHub repository- Support for local path references- A &quot;one ring to rule them all&quot; virtual environment that includes all subprojects within the repository- Batch operations- Note: Single projects are also supported! ðŸ˜…Similar to: nothing! it's unique! ðŸ˜Ž # Prerequisites*Changed in 3.0*: `poetry` is no longer provided out-of-the-box.You need [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed on your system, and it must be available through the `PATH`.The `3.0` version of `coveo-stew` is designed to work with poetry `1.1.13`, `1.1.14` and `1.1.15`. While it is compatible with older versions, old poetry issues such as [this](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/3189) and [this](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/3254) will cause `stew` to misbehave.If you need to work with an older version of poetry, consider using `coveo-stew &lt; 3.0` which had workarounds implemented around these issues.# InstallationJust like poetry, `stew` is a CLI tool that you install in your system.It is recommended to install using [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx) in order to isolate this into a nice little space:```pip install pipx --userpipx install coveo-stew```If you don't use pipx, make sure to isolate the installation into a virtual environment.# GitHub ActionThis action checkouts the code, installs python, poetry and stew, and proceeds to run &quot;stew ci&quot; on a python project.## Usage```ymljobs:  stew-ci:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:      - uses: coveo/stew@main        with:          python-version: &quot;3.10&quot;          project-name: your-project-name```See additional options and documentation in [the action file.](action.yml)## GitHub Action Step ReportWhen running in a GitHub context, a step summary will automatically be generated.This summary can be seen in the `Summary` tab of a workflow run view in GitHub.You can disable this feature by launching `stew ci` with `--no-github-step-report`.# Repository StructurePlease read these guides in order to learn how to organize your repository for maximum compatibility:- [For a single library](README_SINGLE_LIBRARY.md)- [For multiple libraries](README_MULTIPLE_LIBRARIES.md)# Commands## General command usageUnless a project name is specified, most commands will operate on all projects in a git repository based on the current working folder:- `stew &lt;command&gt;`    - Perform a command on all projects- `stew &lt;command&gt; --help`    - Obtain help about a particular command- `stew &lt;command&gt; &lt;project-name&gt;`    - Perform the command on all projects with `&lt;project-name&gt;` in their name (partial match)- `stew &lt;command&gt; &lt;project-name&gt; --exact-match`    - Disable partial project name matchingThe main commands are explained below.## `stew ci`The main show; it runs all CI tools on one or multiple projects.Errors will show in the console, and junit xml reports will be generated inside the `.ci` folder.Without configuration, this command will run the following checks:- mypy (using opinionated, strict rules)  - Note: `mypy` is not provided with `coveo-stew`. See [builtin-runners](#builtin-runners) for info.- poetry check- stew check-outdatedOptions:- `--fix` will reformat the code if `black` fails. Additional fix routines may be added in the future.- `--check &lt;runner&gt;` will launch only that runner. This option can be repeated.- `--skip &lt;runner&gt;` will skip that runner. Takes precedence over `--check`. This option can be repeated.- `--quick` skips running `poetry install --remove-untracked` before running the checks.- `--no-github-step-report` can be used to disable Step Report generation when running in a GitHub context.The configuration for this feature is explained in more details in the [runners](#runners-stew-ci) section.## `stew build`Store the project and its **locked dependencies** to disk, so it can be installed without contacting a `pypi` server.Optimally used to create truly repeatable builds and workflows (e.g.: containerized images, cloud storage, etc).The folder can later be installed offline with `pip install --no-index --find-links &lt;folder&gt; &lt;project-name&gt;`.Options:- `--directory` specifies where the wheels should be downloaded.- `--python` may be used to target a different python. It's important to use the same python version, architecture and OS than the target system.**Make sure your target `&lt;folder&gt;` is clean**: Keep in mind that `pip` will still use the `pyproject.toml` constraints when installing, not `poetry.lock`. The locked version system works when the locked version is the only thing that `pip` can find in the `&lt;folder&gt;`.## `stew check-outdated` and `stew fix-outdated` Checks for out-of-date files or automatically update them.Summary of actions:- `poetry lock` if `pyproject.toml` changed but not the `poetry.lock`- `stew pull-dev-requirements` if a pydev project's dev-requirements are out of sync## `stew pull-dev-requirements`Only useful on `pydev` projects (see about [multiple-libraries](README_MULTIPLE_LIBRARIES.md)).It pulls the dev requirements from the local projects in order to aggregate them into the dev requirements of the root project.Note: This command uses the `dev` group to identify test dependencies.This can be defined as `tool.poetry.dev-dependencies` (poetry 1.1.15) or `tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies`.The group name cannot be customized, feel free to contribute the feature if that's useful to you.## `stew bump`Calls `poetry lock` on all projects.## `stew refresh`Calls `poetry install` on all projects.## `stew fresh-eggs`Clears the `.egg-info` folder from your projects. Usually followed by a `poetry install` or a `stew refresh`.Use this if you change a `[tool.poetry.scripts]` section, else the changes will not be honored.## `stew locate &lt;project&gt;`Returns the path to a project:```$ stew locate coveo-stew/home/jonapich/code/stew/coveo-stew```# ConfigurationConfiguration is done through each `pyproject.toml` file; default values are shown:```[tool.stew.ci]mypy = truepytest = falseblack = falsepoetry-check = truecheck-outdated = trueoffline-build = false```You don't have to include the `[tool.stew.ci]` section at all if these defaults suit you!# Runners (stew ci)*Changed in coveo-stew 3.0*: mypy and black are no longer provided out-of-the-box.In order to use a builtin or custom runner, you must have it installed. These locations are supported:- Recommended: The runner is in the project's virtual environment (most likely as a dev dependency in `pyproject.toml`)- Alternative: The runner is installed in your system and available through the PATHWe strongly suggest pinning them to your`pyproject.toml` file in the `[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]` section.This way, mypy won't surprise you with new failures when they release new versions! ðŸ˜ŽNote: You can override and customize most runners by [rewriting them as custom runners.](#custom-runners)## Builtin Runners### mypyA strict mypy configuration is provided. You can provide your own mypy configuration, but you'll have to specify the `set-config` option: ```[tool.stew.ci]# disable stew's strict mypy config (i.e.: let mypy find its config)mypy = { set-config = False } # use a specific config (path relative to `pyproject.toml`'s folder)mypy = { set-config = &quot;mypy.ini&quot; }```See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#using-a-pyproject-toml### pytestPytest is configured to run with `--doctest-modules --tb=short --durations=5` as well as JUnit report generation.Some additional options are available:```[tool.stew.ci]# configure the markers to test (i.e.: `-m`)pytest = { marker-expression = 'not docker_tests' }# disable the doctestspytest = { doctest-modules = False }```### blackBlack supports the `pyproject.toml` file natively:```[tool.black]line-length = 100```Ref: [black documentation](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-via-a-file)### poetry-checkRuns `poetry check` on each project.### check-outdatedRuns `stew check-outdated`.Note: This runner cannot be overridden, but it can be disabled.### offline-buildRuns `stew build` to a temporary folder and ensures that pip is able to reinstall everything from there.Note: This runner cannot be overridden, but it can be disabled.## Custom RunnersYou can add your own runners to `stew ci`. You can also redefine a builtin runner completely.In this example, we create runners for flake8, bandit and isort. We also redefine the pytest runner:```[tool.stew.ci.custom-runners]flake8 = truebandit = { check-args = [&quot;--quiet&quot;, &quot;--recursive&quot;, &quot;.&quot;] }# some may prefer this toml syntax:[tool.stew.ci.custom-runners.isort]check-args = [&quot;--check&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;--profile black&quot;]autofix-args = [&quot;.&quot;, &quot;--profile black&quot;][tool.stew.ci.custom-runners.pytest] check-args = [&quot;--tb=long&quot;, &quot;--junitxml=.ci/pytest-results.xml&quot;]```When a builtin runner such as pytest is redefined as a custom runner, you must provide all the arguments.In this case, not passing `--junitxml` would mean that we lose the report that used to be in the `.ci/` directory. ### OptionsThe following options are supported for custom runners:- name: You can specify the module name if it differs from the name of the tool.  - Important: Runners are called through `python -m &lt;name&gt;`, not through the shell! - check-args: The arguments to invoke the check.- autofix-args: The arguments to invoke the autofix. Provide the empty string &quot;&quot; in order to run without arguments.- check-failed-exit-codes: A list of ints denoting the exit codes to consider &quot;failed&quot; (anything else will be &quot;error&quot;). 0 is always a success. default is `[1]`.- create-generic-report: Whether to create a generic pass/fail JUnit report for this check.- working-directory: The default is &quot;project&quot; which corresponds to the project's `pyproject.toml` file. You can change it to &quot;repository&quot; in order to run from the root.The `args` and `check-args` can be:- A string  - Such as a single argument &quot;--check&quot;  - Such as a path &quot;.&quot;  - Such as an option &quot;--profile black&quot;  - But NOT as a combo of the above: &quot;--check . --profile black&quot; will most likely not work.- A list of string:  - Any combination of the &quot;string&quot; rules explained above.# FAQ, Tips and Tricks## constraints vs locks - where do they apply?When you call `poetry install`, you end up installing packages based on the `poetry.lock` file.The resulting packages will always be the same, no matter what.This is the dev scenario.When you call `pip install`, you are installing packages based on the constraints placed in a `pyproject.toml` or a `setup.py` file.Unless the constraints are hard pinned versions, the resulting packages are not guaranteed and will depend on the point in time when the installation is performed, among other factors.This is the shared library scenario.When you use poetry, you cover the two scenarios above.The third scenario is the private business use case: you want to freeze your dependencies in time so that everything from the developer to the CI servers to the production system is identical.Essentially, you want `poetry install` without the dev requirements.This functionality is provided out of the box by `stew build`, which creates a pip-installable package from the lock file that you can then stash in a private storage of your choice or pass around your deployments.## How to provision a business production system / how to freeze your project for &quot;offline&quot; distributionYou can keep `poetry` and `stew` off your production environment by creating a frozen archive of your application or library from your CI servers (docker used as example):- Use the `stew build` tool which:    - performs a `poetry build` on your project    - calls `pip download` based on the content of the lock file    - Moves the artifacts to the `.wheels` folder of your repo- Recommended: Use the `--python` switch when calling `stew build` to specify which python executable to use! Make sure to use a python interpreter that matches the os/arch/bits of the system you want to provision.The content in `.wheels` can then be zipped and moved around. A typical scenario is to push it into a Docker Container:- Include the `.wheels` folder into your Docker build context- In your Dockerfile:    - ADD the `.wheels` folder    - Manage the `pip` version! Either update it to latest, or pin it to something.    - Prepare a python environment        - Use `python -m venv &lt;location&gt;` to create a virtual environment natively.        - Note the executable location... typically (`location/bin/python` or `location/Scripts/python.exe`)    - Install your application into the python environment you just created:        - Use `&lt;venv-python-executable&gt; -m pip install &lt;your-package&gt; --no-index --find-links &lt;wheels-folder-location&gt;`    - You may delete the `.wheels` folder if you want. Consider keeping a copy of the lock file within the docker image, for reference.To make sure you use the python interpreter that matches the os/arch/bits of the system you want to provision, you can run `stew build` directly when building the container image.In order to do so without packaging `stew` in production, you can use [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/).## How to hook your IDE with the virtual environmentIf your IDE supports poetry, it should detect and use the `pyproject.toml` file.To set it up manually:1. Call `poetry install` from the location of the `pyproject.toml` file1. Obtain the location of the virtual environment (i.e.: `poetry env list --full-path`)1. Configure your IDE to use the python interpreter from that locationYour IDE should proceed to analyze the environment and will pick up all imports automatically, regardless of your PYTHONPATH or your working directory.Since the local source is editable, any change to the source code will be reflected on the next interpreter run.If you use the multiple-projects approach, you should hook your IDE to the `pydev` environment. See [this documentation](./README_MULTIPLE_LIBRARIES.md) for more information.## Using the virtual environment without activating itUsing the correct interpreter is all you need to do. There is no activation script or environment variables to set up: the interpreter executable inside the virtual environment folder is a fully bootstrapped and isolated environment.- A python dockerfile may call `&lt;venv-python-exec&gt;` directly in the dockerfile's CMD- A service that spawns other processes should receive the path to the `&lt;venv-python-exec&gt;`[Use the `-m` switch](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-m) in order to launch your app!</longdescription>
