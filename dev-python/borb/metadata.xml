About borb`borb` is a pure python library to read, write and manipulate PDF documents. It represents a PDF document as a JSON-like datastructure of nested lists, dictionaries and primitives (numbers, string, booleans, etc)This is currently a one-man project, so the focus will always be to support those use-cases that are more common in favor of those that are rare.## 1. About the ExamplesThe examples can be found in a separate repository.This ensures the `borb` repository stays relatively small, whilst still providing a thorough knowledgebase of code-samples, screenshots and explanatory text.[Check out the examples repository here!](https://github.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples)They include; - Reading a PDF and extracting meta-information- Changing meta-information  - Extracting text from a PDF- Extracting images from a PDF- Changing images in a PDF- Adding annotations (notes, links, etc) to a PDF- Adding text to a PDF- Adding tables to a PDF- Adding lists to a PDF- Using a PageLayout manager and much more ### 1.0 Installing `borb``borb` can be installed using `pip`    pip install borbIf you have installed `borb` before, and you want to ensure `pip` downloads the latest version (rather than using its internal cache) you can use the following commands:    pip uninstall borb    pip install --no-cache borb### 1.1 Hello WorldTo give you an immediate idea of the way `borb` works, this is the classic `Hello World` example, in `borb`:```pythonfrom pathlib import Pathfrom borb.pdf import Documentfrom borb.pdf import Pagefrom borb.pdf import SingleColumnLayoutfrom borb.pdf import Paragraphfrom borb.pdf import PDF# create an empty Documentpdf = Document()# add an empty Pagepage = Page()pdf.add_page(page)# use a PageLayout (SingleColumnLayout in this case)layout = SingleColumnLayout(page)# add a Paragraph objectlayout.add(Paragraph(&quot;Hello World!&quot;))    # store the PDFwith open(Path(&quot;output.pdf&quot;), &quot;wb&quot;) as pdf_file_handle:    PDF.dumps(pdf_file_handle, pdf)```## 2. License`borb` is dual licensed as AGPL/Commercial software.AGPL is a free / open source software license.This doesn't mean the software is [gratis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre)!Buying a license is mandatory as soon as you develop commercial activities distributing the borb software inside your product or deploying it on a network without disclosing the source code of your own applications under the AGPL license. These activities include:- Offering paid services to customers as an ASP- Serving PDFs on the fly in the cloud or in a web application- Shipping `borb` with a closed source product[Contact sales](https://borbpdf.com/) for more information.## 3.
