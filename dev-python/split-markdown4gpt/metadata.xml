	<longdescription># split_markdown4gpt`split_markdown4gpt` is a Python tool designed to split large Markdown files into smaller sections based on a specified token limit. This is particularly useful for processing large Markdown files with GPT models, as it allows the models to handle the data in manageable chunks._**Version 1.0.9** (2023-06-19)_## InstallationYou can install `split_markdown4gpt` via pip:```bashpip install split_markdown4gpt```## CLI UsageAfter installation, you can use the `mdsplit4gpt` command to split a Markdown file. Here's the basic syntax:```bashmdsplit4gpt path_to_your_file.md --model gpt-3.5-turbo --limit 4096 --separator &quot;=== SPLIT ===&quot;```This command will split the Markdown file at `path_to_your_file.md` into sections, each containing no more than 4096 tokens (as counted by the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model). The sections will be separated by `=== SPLIT ===`.All CLI options:```NAME    mdsplit4gpt - Splits a Markdown file into sections according to GPT token size limits.SYNOPSIS    mdsplit4gpt MD_PATH &lt;flags&gt;DESCRIPTION    This tool loads a Markdown file, and splits its content into sections    that are within the specified token size limit using the desired GPT tokenizing model. The resulting    sections are then concatenated using the specified separator and returned as a single string.POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS    MD_PATH        Type: Union        The path of the source Markdown file to be split.FLAGS    -m, --model=MODEL        Type: str        Default: 'gpt-3.5-turbo'        The GPT tokenizer model to use for calculating token sizes. Defaults to &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;.    -l, --limit=LIMIT        Type: Optional[int]        Default: None        The maximum number of GPT tokens allowed per section. Defaults to the model's maximum tokens.    -s, --separator=SEPARATOR        Type: str        Default: '=== SPLIT ==='        The string used to separate sections in the output. Defaults to &quot;=== SPLIT ===&quot;.```## Python UsageYou can also use `split_markdown4gpt` in your Python code. Here's a basic example:```pythonfrom split_markdown4gpt import splitsections = split(&quot;path_to_your_file.md&quot;, model=&quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;, limit=4096)for section in sections:    print(section)```This code does the same thing as the CLI command above, but in Python.- **[See the API documentation](https://twardoch.github.io/split-markdown4gpt/API.html)** for more advanced usage## How it Works`split_markdown4gpt` works by tokenizing the input Markdown file using the specified GPT model's tokenizer (default is `gpt-3.5-turbo`). It then splits the file into sections, each containing no more than the specified token limit.The splitting process respects the structure of the Markdown file. It will not split a section (as defined by Markdown headings) across multiple output sections unless the section is longer than the token limit. In that case, itwill split the section at the sentence level.The tool uses several libraries to accomplish this:- `tiktoken` for tokenizing the text according to the GPT model's rules.- `fire` for creating the CLI.- `frontmatter` for parsing the Markdown file's front matter (metadata at the start of the file).- `mistletoe` for parsing the Markdown file into a syntax tree.- `syntok` for splitting the text into sentences.- `regex` and `PyYAML` for various utility functions.### Use Cases`split_markdown4gpt` is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to process large Markdown files with GPT models. For instance:- **Text Generation**: If you're using a GPT model to generate text based on a large Markdown file, you can use `split_markdown4gpt` to split the file into manageable sections. This allows the GPT model to process the file in chunks, preventing token overflow errors.- **Data Preprocessing**: In machine learning projects, you often need to preprocess your data before feeding it into your model. If your data is in the form of large Markdown files, `split_markdown4gpt` can help you split these files into smaller sections based on the token limit of your model.- **Document Analysis**: If you're analyzing large Markdown documents (e.g., extracting keywords, summarizing content), you can use `split_markdown4gpt` to break down the documents into smaller sections. This makes the analysis more manageable and efficient.## Changelog- v1.0.7: Switched the model for each section from namedtuple to dict- v1.0.6: Fixes- v1.0.0: Initial release## ContributingContributions to `split_markdown4gpt` are welcome!
