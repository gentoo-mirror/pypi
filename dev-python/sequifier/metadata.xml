It contains the number of classes found in the data, a map of classes to indices and the oaths to train, validation and test splits of data. Adapt the `dd_config` parameter in `train-on-preprocessed.yaml` and `infer.yaml` in to the path `[PROJECT PATH]/configs/ddconfigs/[FILE NAME]`and set `project_path` to `PROJECT PATH` in both configs7. run```consolesequifier --train --on-preprocessed --config_path=[PROJECT PATH]/configs/train-on-preprocessed.yaml```8. adapt `inference_data_path` in `infer.yaml`9. run```consolesequifier --infer --config_path=[PROJECT PATH]/configs/infer.yaml```10. find your predictions at `[PROJECT PATH]/outputs/predictions/sequifier-default-best_predictions.csv`## More detailed explanations of the three steps#### Preprocessing of data into sequences for trainingThe preprocessing step is designed for scenarios where for long seriesof events, the prediction of the next event from the previous N events  is of interest.In cases of sequences where only the last item is a valid target, the preprocessingstep should not be executed.This step presupposes input data with three columns: &quot;sequenceId&quot;, &quot;itemId&quot; and &quot;timesort&quot;.&quot;sequenceId&quot; and &quot;itemId&quot; identify sequence and item, and the timesort column mustprovide values that enable sequential sorting. Often this will simply be a timestamp.You can find an example of the preprocessing input data at [documentation/example_inputs/preprocessing_input.csv](./documentation/example_inputs/preprocessing_input.csv)The data can then be processed and split into training, validation and testing datasets of allvalid subsequences in the original data with the command:```consolesequifier --preprocess --config_path=[CONFIG PATH]```The config path specifies the path to the preprocessing config and the projectpath the path to the (preferably empty) folder the output files of the differentsteps are written to.The default config can be found on this path:[configs/preprocess.yaml](./configs/preprocess.yaml)#### Configuring and training the sequence classification modelThe training step is executed with the command:```consolesequifier --train --config_path=[CONFIG PATH]```If the data on which the model is trained comes from the preprocessing step, the flag```console--on-preprocessed```should also be added.If the training data does not come from the preprocessing step, both train and validationdata have to take the form of a csv file with the columns &quot;sequenceId&quot;, [SEQ LENGTH], [SEQ LENGTH - 1],...,&quot;1&quot;, &quot;target&quot;.You can find an example of the preprocessing input data at [documentation/example_inputs/training_input.csv](./documentation/example_inputs/training_input.csv)The training step is configured using the config. The two default configs can be found here:[configs/train.yaml](./configs/train.yaml)[configs/train-on-preprocessed.yaml](./configs/train-on-preprocessed.yaml)depending on whether the preprocessing step was executed.#### Inferring on test data using the trained modelInference is done using the command:```consolesequifier --infer --config_path=[CONFIG PATH]```and configured using a config file. The default version can be found here:[configs/infer.yaml](./configs/infer.yaml)</longdescription>
