It consists of:* `Info` - index page with optional information about your tool or project;* `Scenarios` - section for features management, contains subsections    `Features`, `Test runs`, `Versions` and `Tags`:    * `Features`        gives an interface for features records management and provides info        about id, name author, time, editor and publishing status; it is possible        to search, edit or delete items through Script panel.        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave/master/docs/includes/images/label_img.png          :width: 500          :align: center          :alt: Features list    * `Test runs`        gives an interface for test runs management and provides info about.        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave/master/docs/includes/images/test_runs_img.png          :width: 500          :align: center          :alt: Test runs list    * Versions        contains feature versions in corresponding to test runs; versions contains PR-links to        the remote Git repository.        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave/master/docs/includes/images/versions_img.png          :width: 500          :align: center          :alt: Feature published versions list    * Tags        contains tags values, which are used for feature's tagging.        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave/master/docs/includes/images/tags_img.png          :width: 500          :align: center          :alt: Feature published versions list* `Test users` - section for viewing and configuring test users;* `Access` - section for access management, contains `Users` and    `Groups` subsections;* `Emulation` - experimental section for alternative tools implementation    (in development).**Overhave** features could be created and/or edited through special*script panel* in feature edit mode. Feature should have type registered by theapplication, unique name, specified tasks list with the traditional format```PRJ-NUMBER``` and scenario text.**Script panel** has `pytest-bdd`_ steps table on the right side of interface.These steps should be defined in appropriate fixture modules and registeredat the application on start-up to be displayed... figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave/master/docs/includes/images/panel_img.png  :width: 600  :align: center  :alt: Script panel  Example of **Overhave** script panel in feature edit modeAllure report-------------**Overhave** generates `Allure`_ report after tests execution in web-interface.If you execute tests manually through `PyTest`_, these results are could beconverted into the `Allure`_ report also with the `Allure CLI`_ tool.This report contains scenarios descriptions as they are described in features... figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave/master/docs/includes/images/report_img.png  :width: 600  :align: center  :alt: Allure test-case report  Example of generated `Allure`_ report after execution of **Overhave**'s featureDemo-mode (Quickstart)----------------------**Overhave** has special demo-mode (in development), which could be possiblyused for framework demonstration and manual debugging / testing. The frameworkprovides a CLI entrypoints for easy server run in debug mode:.. code-block:: shell    make up  # start PostgreSQL database and Redis    overhave db create-all  # create Overhave database schema    overhave-demo admin  # start Overhave admin on port 8076 in debug mode    overhave-demo consumer -s test  # start Overhave test execution consumer**Note**: you could run admin in special mode, which does not requireconsumers. This mode uses *threadpool* for running testing and publicationtasks asynchronously:.. code-block:: shell    overhave-demo admin --threadpool --language=ruBut this *threadpool* mode is unscalable in *kubernetes* paradigm. So,it's highly recommended to use corresponding consumers exactly.Command-line interface----------------------**Overhave** has a CLI that provides a simple way to start service web-interface,run consumer and execute basic database operations. Examples are below:.. code-block:: shell    overhave db create-all    overhave admin --port 8080    overhave consumer -s publication    overhave api -p 8000 -w 4**Note**: service start-up takes a set of settings, so you can set them throughvirtual environment with prefix ```OVERHAVE_```, for example ```OVERHAVE_DB_URL```.If you want to configure settings in more explicit way through context injection,please see next part of docs.Context injection-----------------Context setting^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Service could be configured via application context injection with preparedinstance of `OverhaveContext` object. This context could be set using```set_context``` function of initialized ```ProxyFactory``` instance.For example, ```my_custom_context``` prepared. So, application start-up couldbe realised with follow code:.. code-block:: python    from overhave import overhave_app, overhave_admin_factory    factory = overhave_admin_factory()    factory.set_context(my_custom_context)    overhave_app(factory).run(host='localhost', port=8080, debug=True)**Note**:* ```overhave_app``` is the prepared `Flask` application with already enabled    Flask Admin and Login Manager plug-ins;* ```overhave_factory``` is a function for LRU cached instance of the **Overhave**    factory ```ProxyFactory```; the instance has an access to application components,    directly used in ```overhave_app```.* ```my_custom_context``` is an example of context configuration, see an    example code in `context_example.rst`_.Redis---------* **RedisSentinel** - redis connection through sentinel. To enable sentinel connection use env OVERHAVE_REDIS_SENTINEL_ENABLED=True* **Redis** - default redis connection without sentinel.Consumers---------**Overhave** has `producer-consumer` architecture, based on Redis streams,and supported 3 consumer's types:* **TEST** - consumer for test execution with it's own factory    ```overhave_test_execution_factory```;* **PUBLICATION** - consumer for features publication with it's own factory    ```overhave_publication_factory```;* **EMULATION** - consumer for specific emulation with it's own factory    ```overhave_emulation_factory```.**Note**: the ```overhave_test_execution_factory``` has ability for context injectionand could be enriched with the custom context as the ```overhave_admin_factory```.Project structure-----------------**Overhave** supports it's own special project structure:.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave/master/docs/includes/images/project_structure.png  :width: 300  :alt: **Overhave** project structureThe right approach is to create a **root directory** (like &quot;demo&quot; inside the currentrepository) that contains **features**, **fixtures** and **steps** directories.The **Features** directory contains different feature types asseparate directories, each of them corresponds to predefined `pytest-bdd`_set of steps.The **Fixtures** directory contains typical `PyTest`_ modules splitted by differentfeature types. These modules are used for `pytest-bdd`_ isolated test runs. It isnecessary because of special mechanism of `pytest-bdd`_ steps collection.The **Steps** directory contains `pytest-bdd`_ steps packages splitted by differrentfeature types also. Each steps subdirectory has it's own declared steps in accordingto supported feature type.So, it is possible to create your own horizontal structure ofdifferent product directions with unique steps and `PyTest`_ fixtures.**Note**: this structure is used in **Overhave** application. The formed datagives a possibility to specify registered feature type in the web-interface*script panel*. Also, this structure defines which steps will be displayed inthe right side of *script panel*.Feature format--------------**Overhave** has it's own special feature's text format, which inheritsGherkin from `pytest-bdd`_ with unique updates:* required tag that is related to existing feature type directory, where    current feature is located;* any amount of arbitrary tags;* severity tag - implements `Allure`_ severity to feature or just tagged    scenario (for example: ```@severity.blocker```);* info about feature - who is creator, last editor and publisher;* task tracker's tickets with format ```PRJ-1234```;An example of filled feature content is located in`feature_example.rst`_.Pytest markers--------------**Overhave** implements solution for `PyTest`_ markers usage with customadditional information:* &quot;`disabled`&quot;: same as `skip` marker, but it's necessary to setup reason;* &quot;`xfail`&quot;: traditional `xfail` with strict reason presence.Examples:.. code-block:: gherkin    @disabled(not ready)    Feature: My business feature.. code-block:: gherkin    @disabled(TODO: https://tracker.myorg.com/browse/PRJ-333; deadline 01.01.25)    Scenario: Yet another business feature.. code-block:: gherkin    @xfail(bug: https://tracker.myorg.com/browse/PRJ-555)    Scenario outline: Other business featureIf reason contains URL, so **Overhave** will attach `Allure` link to report:for `disabled` - it will be `LinkType.LINK`, for `xfail` - `LinkType.ISSUE`.Feature links-------------**Overhave** has ability to set links to it's own admin service in `Allure`_test-cases. Link will be set automatically when you generate `Allure`_ report.This function can be enabled via setup of environment variable```OVERHAVE_ADMIN_URL```:.. code-block:: bash    export OVERHAVE_ADMIN_URL=https://overhave-admin.myorg.comAlso, **Overhave** has ability to set links to feature file in `Git`_ repository.Link will be set automatically when you generate `Allure`_ report. This functioncan be enabled via setup of environment variable```OVERHAVE_GIT_PROJECT_URL```:.. code-block:: bash    export OVERHAVE_GIT_PROJECT_URL=https://git.myorg.com/bdd-features-repoLanguage--------The web-interface language is ENG by default and could not be switched(if it's necessary - please, create a ```feature request``` or contributeyourself).The feature text as well as `pytest-bdd`_ BDD keywords are configurablewith **Overhave** extra models, for example RUS keywords are already definedin framework and available for usage:.. code-block:: python    from overhave.extra import RUSSIAN_PREFIXES    language_settings = OverhaveLanguageSettings(step_prefixes=RUSSIAN_PREFIXES)**Note**: you could create your own prefix-value mapping for your language:.. code-block:: python    from overhave import StepPrefixesModel    GERMAN_PREFIXES = StepPrefixesModel(        FEATURE=&quot;Merkmal:&quot;,        SCENARIO_OUTLINE=&quot;Szenarioübersicht:&quot;,        SCENARIO=&quot;Szenario:&quot;,        BACKGROUND=&quot;Hintergrund:&quot;,        EXAMPLES=&quot;Beispiele:&quot;,        EXAMPLES_VERTICAL=&quot;Beispiele: Vertikal&quot;,        GIVEN=&quot;Gegeben &quot;,        WHEN=&quot;Wann &quot;,        THEN=&quot;Dann &quot;,        AND=&quot;Und &quot;,        BUT=&quot;Aber &quot;,    )Git integration---------------**Overhave** gives an ability to sent your new features or changes toremote git repository, which is hosted by `Bitbucket`_ or `GitLab`_.Integration with bitbucket is native, while integration with GitLabuses `python-gitlab`_ library.You are able to set necessary settings for your project:.. code-block:: python    publisher_settings = OverhaveGitlabPublisherSettings(        repository_id='123',        default_target_branch_name='master',    )    client_settings=OverhaveGitlabClientSettings(        url=&quot;https://gitlab.mycompany.com&quot;,        auth_token=os.environ.get(&quot;MY_GITLAB_AUTH_TOKEN&quot;),    )The pull-request (for Bitbucket) or merge-request (for GitLab)created when you click the button `Create pull request` ontest run result's page. This button is available only for `success`test run's result.**Note**: one of the most popular cases of GitLab APIauthentication is the OAUTH2 schema with service account.In according to this schema, you should have OAUTH2 token,which is might have a short life-time and could not bespecified through environment. For this situation, **Overhave**has special `TokenizerClient` with it's own`TokenizerClientSettings` - this simple client could takethe token from a remote custom GitLab tokenizer service.Git-to-DataBase synchronization-------------------------------**Overhave** gives an ability to synchronize your current `git`_repository's state with database. It means that your features,which are located on the database, could be updated - and the sourceof updates is your repository.**For example**: you had to do bulk data replacement in `git`_repository, and now you want to deliver changes to remote database.This not so easy matter could be solved with **Overhave** specialtooling:You are able to set necessary settings for your project:.. code-block:: bash    overhave sync run  # only update existing features    overhave sync run --create-db-features  # update + create new features    overhave sync run --pull-repository  # pull git repo and run syncYou are able to test this tool with **Overhave** demo mode.By default, 3 features are created in demo database. Just tryto change them or create new features and run synchronizationcommand - you will get the result... code-block:: bash    overhave-demo sync-run  # or with '--create-db-features'**Overhave** supports validation of existing feature files.Command try to parse features and fill defined feature info format.If there is any problem, special error will be thrown... code-block:: bash    overhave sync validate-features    overhave sync validate-features --raise-if-nullable-id    overhave sync validate-features --pull-repositoryAnd yes, your are able to try it with demo mode:.. code-block:: bash    overhave-demo validate-features    overhave sync validate-features -r  # --raise-if-nullable-idCustom index------------**Overhave** gives an ability to set custom index.html file for rendering. Pathto file could be set through environment as well as set with context:.. code-block:: python    admin_settings = OverhaveAdminSettings(        index_template_path=&quot;/path/to/index.html&quot;    )Authorization strategy----------------------**Overhave** provides several authorization strategies, declared by```AuthorizationStrategy``` enum:* `Simple` - strategy without real authorization.    Each user could use preferred name. This name will be used for user    authority. Each user is unique. Password not required.* `Default` - strategy with real authorization.    Each user could use only registered credentials.* `LDAP` - strategy with authorization using remote LDAP server.    Each user should use his LDAP credentials. LDAP    server returns user groups. If user in default 'admin' group or his groups    list contains admin group - user will be authorized. If user already placed    in database - user will be authorized too. No one password stores.Appropriate strategy and additional data should be placed into```OverhaveAuthorizationSettings```, for example LDAP strategy could beconfigured like this:.. code-block:: python    auth_settings = OverhaveAuthorizationSettings(auth_strategy=AuthorizationStrategy.LDAP)    ldap_manager_settings = OverhaveLdapManagerSettings(ldap_admin_group=&quot;admin&quot;)S3 cloud--------**Overhave** implements functionality for *s3* cloud interactions, such asbucket creation and deletion, files uploading, downloading and deletion.The framework provides an ability to store reports and other files inthe remote s3 cloud storage. You could enrich your environment with followingsettings:.. code-block:: shell    OVERHAVE_S3_ENABLED=true    OVERHAVE_S3_URL=https://s3.example.com    OVERHAVE_S3_ACCESS_KEY=&lt;MY_ACCESS_KEY&gt;    OVERHAVE_S3_SECRET_KEY=&lt;MY_SECRET_KEY&gt;Optionally, you could change default settings also:.. code-block:: shell    OVERHAVE_S3_VERIFY=false    OVERHAVE_S3_AUTOCREATE_BUCKETS=trueThe framework with enabled ```OVERHAVE_S3_AUTOCREATE_BUCKETS``` flag will createapplication buckets in remote storage if buckets don't exist.API---**Overhave** has it's own application programming interface, based on`FastAPI`_... figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave/master/docs/includes/images/api_img.png  :width: 600  :align: center  :alt: Allure test-case report  **Overhave** openapi.json through `Swagger`_Current possibilities could be displayed through built-in`Swagger`_ - just run the API and open http://localhost:8000 in yourbrowser... code-block:: bash    overhave api -p 8000Interface has authorization through `oauth2`_ scheme, so you should setup```OVERHAVE_API_AUTH_SECRET_KEY``` for usage.Right now, API implements types of resources:* `feature_tags`    get feature tag or get list of feature tags;* `features`    get features info by tag ID or tag value;* `test_users`    get test user info, specification, put new specification or delete    test user;* `test_runs`    get test run info or create test run with given parameters;* `emulations`    get emulation runs by test user id.------------Contributing------------Contributions are very welcome.Preparation-----------Project installation is very easyand takes just few prepared commands (`make pre-init` works only for Ubuntu;so you can install same packages for your OS manually):.. code-block:: shell    make pre-init    make initPackages management is provided by `Poetry`_.Check-----Tests can be run with `Tox`_. `Docker-compose`_ is used for other servicespreparation and serving, such as database. Simple tests and linters execution:.. code-block:: shell    make up    make test    make lintPlease, see `make` file and discover useful shortcuts. You could run testsin docker container also:.. code-block:: shell    make test-dockerDocumentation build-------------------Project documentation could be built via `Sphinx`_ and simple `make` command:.. code-block:: shell    make build-docsBy default, the documentation will be built using `html` builder into `_build`directory.-------License-------Distributed under the terms of the `GNU GPLv2`_ license.------Issues------If you encounter any problems, please report them here in section `Issues`with a detailed description... _`Overhave`: https://github.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave.. _`Pydantic`: https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic.. _`Flask Admin`: https://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin.. _`Ace`: https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace.. _`PyTest`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest.. _`pytest-bdd`: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd.. _`Allure`: https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-python.. _`Allure CLI`: https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_get_started.. _`Bitbucket`: https://www.atlassian.com/git.. _`GitLab`: https://about.gitlab.com.. _`python-gitlab`: https://python-gitlab.readthedocs.io.. _`SQLAlchemy`: https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy.. _`Walrus`: https://github.com/coleifer/walrus.. _`GoTTY`: https://github.com/yudai/gotty.. _`GNU GPLv2`: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.. _`Tox`: https://github.com/tox-dev/tox.. _`Poetry`: https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry.. _`Docker-compose`: https://docs.docker.com/compose.. _`Typer`: https://github.com/tiangolo/typer.. _`Sphinx`: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx.. _`boto3`: https://github.com/boto/boto3.. _`git`: https://git-scm.com/.. _`FastAPI`: https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi.. _`Swagger`: https://swagger.io.. _`oauth2`: https://oauth.net/2/.. _`context_example.rst`: https://github.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave/blob/master/docs/includes/context_example.rst.. _`feature_example.rst`: https://github.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave/blob/master/docs/includes/features_structure_example/feature_type_1/full_feature_example_en.feature</longdescription>
