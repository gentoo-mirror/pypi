The intention is that the robots will chase after these targets,and switch to a new target after catching their current one. The targets are &quot;transparent&quot; androbots are free to ignore &quot;avoiding them&quot;, the intention is that they avoid each other. Anexample of a simulation with robot controller is shown below... image:: misc/example_sim.gifInstallation------------Either you can clone and pip install the source, or you can install via pypi... code:: bash    git clone https://github.com/5had3z/chasing-targets-gym &amp;&amp; cd chasing-targets-gym &amp;&amp; pip3 install -e .Otherwise install pypi package.. code:: bash    pip3 install chasing-targets-gymSome Credit-----------I was pointed to a basic environment `here &lt;https://github.com/riiswa/planning-multi-robot-gym&gt;`_ but it didn'treally match what I wanted, so I made my own based off this.</longdescription>
