	<longdescription># ColorItA simple library to add color to your output.Have you ever wanted to print Colors to the console? I certainly have. There comes a time when you realize it is a necessity. That's why I created ColorIt. ColorIt is a super simple way to print color to the console. ## How it worksInterally, the library creates custom ANSI sequences with RGB values. This means there are 16 million colors that can be used with `colorit`!## InstallationTo install `colorit`. Run `pip install color-it` on Windows, or `pip3 install color-it` on macOS and Linux, from there it can be imported with `import colorit`## How to use itTo use ColorIt:```pythonfrom colorit import *# Use this to ensure that ColorIt will be usable by certain command line interfacesinit_colorit()# Foregroundprint(color(&quot;This text is red&quot;, Colors.red))print(color(&quot;This text is orange&quot;, Colors.orange))print(color(&quot;This text is yellow&quot;, Colors.yellow))print(color(&quot;This text is green&quot;, Colors.green))print(color(&quot;This text is blue&quot;, Colors.blue))print(color(&quot;This text is purple&quot;, Colors.purple))print(color(&quot;This text is white&quot;, Colors.white))# Backgroundprint(background(&quot;This text has a background that is red&quot;, Colors.red))print(background(&quot;This text has a background that is orange&quot;, Colors.orange))print(background(&quot;This text has a background that is yellow&quot;, Colors.yellow))print(background(&quot;This text has a background that is green&quot;, Colors.green))print(background(&quot;This text has a background that is blue&quot;, Colors.blue))print(background(&quot;This text has a background that is purple&quot;, Colors.purple))print(background(&quot;This text has a background that is white&quot;, Colors.white))# Customprint(color(&quot;This color has a custom grey text color&quot;, (150, 150, 150)))print(background(&quot;This color has a custom grey background&quot;, (150, 150, 150)))# Combinationprint(    background(        color(&quot;This text is blue with a white background&quot;, Colors.blue), Colors.white    ))# If you are using Windows Command Line, this is so that it doesn't close immediatelyinput()```As output you get:![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55718659/88487218-1fbcf800-cf51-11ea-8a27-678407774a37.png)If you would like to try this for yoyr self, you can download `demo.py` and try it out. And that's it. That's really all there is to it.**Additional Note**: `init_colorit()` clears the console, so put this somewhere in your code before printing output.## Release Log* Released the first version of ColorIt (v1.0.0)* Added a license## Support me on patreon!Here is the link to my patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/supermazingcoder :D</longdescription>
