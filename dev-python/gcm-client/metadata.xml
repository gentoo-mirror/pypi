	<longdescription>gcm-client==========Python client for `Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) &lt;http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html&gt;`_.Check `documentation &lt;http://gcm-client.readthedocs.org&gt;`_ to learn how to use it.Check the client with similar interface for `Apple Push Notification service &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/apns-client/&gt;`_.Requirements------------- `requests &lt;http://docs.python-requests.org&gt;`_ - HTTP request, handles proxies etc.- `omnijson &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/omnijson/&gt;`_ if you use Python 2.5 or older.Alternatives------------Th only alternative library known at the time of writing was `python-gcm&lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-gcm&gt;`_.  This library differs in thefollowing design decisions:- *Predictable execution time*. Do not automatically retry request on failure.  According to Google's recommendations, each retry has to wait exponential  back-off delay. We use Celery back-end, where the best way to retry after  some delay will be scheduling the task with ``countdown=delay``.  Sleeping  while in Celery worker hurts your concurrency.- *Do not forget results if you need to retry*. This sounds obvious, but  ``python-gcm`` drops important results, such as canonical ID mapping if  request needs to be (partially) retried.- *Clean pythonic API*. No need to borrow all Java like exceptions etc.- *Do not hard-code validation, let GCM fail*. This decision makes library  a little bit more future proof.Support-------GCM client was created by `Sardar Yumatov &lt;mailto:ja.doma@gmail.com&gt;`_,contact me if you find any bugs or need help. Contact `Getlogic&lt;http://getlogic.nl&gt;`_ if you need a full-featured push notification servicefor all popular platforms. You can view outstanding issues on the `GCMBitbucket page &lt;https://bitbucket.org/sardarnl/gcm-client/&gt;`_.</longdescription>
