Do not use and report usage to the authorhttps://twitter.com/cejetvole**dbxfs allows you to mount your Dropbox folder as if it were a localfilesystem. It differs from the official Dropbox client in two mainways:* Internet connectivity is required for access* No disk space is required for access, but will cache if disk space is availabledbxfs has been tested on OpenBSD, Linux, and macOS but it should run on anyPOSIX system that provides a FUSE-compatible library or has theability to mount SMB shares. Windows support is coming very soon. Itruns on non-x86 architectures like ARM. It doesn't require a specificfile system.It is written for Python 3.5+ and is licensed under the GPLv3.Disclaimer: dbxfs is not affiliated with Dropbox, Inc.Installation------------If you are on Linux, you must install your OS's FUSE library. OnDebian/Ubuntu, install the ``libfuse2`` package, on Fedora install``fuse``.Run the following command::  $ pip3 install dbxfsOn Arch Linux and derivatives, you can find it in the AUR as`dbxfs &lt;https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dbxfs&gt;`_.Usage-----Use ``dbxfs`` like you would use the ``mount`` command::  $ dbxfs &lt;mount_point&gt;To unmount your Dropbox folder on Linux systems, you can use``fusermount -u &lt;mount_point&gt;``, on all other systems use ``umount``.You can see the full list of command line options by passing ``-h`` tothe ``dbxfs`` command.Advanced Refresh Token Storage------------------------------By default dbxfs stores your refresh token in anencrypted file but you may want to store it in a GPG encrypted fileor something else. To do that you must first obtain a refresh token.You can obtain a refresh token by running the following command::  $ dbxfs --get-refresh-tokenOnce you have obtained the refresh token, encrypt it with the program ofyour choice and store the result somewhere. After that, you must editthe dbxfs config file. You can find the location of the config file byrunning the following command::  $ dbxfs --print-default-config-fileThe config file is a JSON encoded file. Add the following JSON key tothe top-level JSON object in that file::  &quot;refresh_token_command&quot;: [&quot;gpg&quot;, &quot;--decrypt&quot;, &quot;/path/to/refresh/token/file.gpg&quot;]Adapt it to a decryption program of your choice. This configurationworks great for storing the refresh token using a OpenPGP card.Contact-------Rian Hunter `@cejetvole &lt;https://twitter.com/cejetvole&gt;`_</longdescription>
