	<longdescription>Attempts to determine the natural language of a selection of Unicode (utf-8) text. Based on `guesslanguage.cpp&lt;http://websvn.kde.org/branches/work/sonnet-refactoring/common/nlp/guesslanguage.cpp?view=markup&gt;`_by Jacob R Rideout for KDE which itself is based on`Language::Guess &lt;http://languid.cantbedone.org/&gt;`_ by Maciej Ceglowski.Detects over 60 languages - all languages listed in the `trigrams&lt;http://code.google.com/p/guess-language/source/browse/trunk/guess_language/trigrams/&gt;`_directory plus Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Greek.guess_language uses heuristics based on the character set and trigrams in a sample text to detect the language. It works better with longer samples and will be confused if the sample text includes markup such as HTML tags.Usage=====The main entry points all take a single string as input and return a language identifier. The string must be Unicode or UTF-8 text. The language identifer can be the language namein English, the two- or three-letter IANA language code, a language ID or a tuple containingall three codes.The primary entry points, and the return values, are as follows::  guessLanguage(txt) - IANA language code  guessLanguageTag(txt) - IANA language code (same as guessLanguage)  guessLanguageName(txt) - Language name in English  guessLanguageId(txt) - language ID  guessLanguageInfo(txt) - tuple of (IANA code, id, name)</longdescription>
