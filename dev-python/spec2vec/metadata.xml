Where Word2Vec learns relationships between words in sentences,**spec2vec** does so for mass fragments and neutral losses in MS/MS spectra.The spectral similarity score is based on spectral embeddings learntfrom the fragmental relationships within a large set of spectral data.

Model trained with older versions should still be importable without any issues. If you had scripts that used additional gensim code, however, those might occationally need some adaptation, see also the `gensim documentation on how to migrate your code &lt;https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/wiki/Migrating-from-Gensim-3.x-to-4&gt;`_.Installation============Prerequisites:  - Python 3.7, 3.8, or 3.9  - Recommended: AnacondaWe recommend installing spec2vec from Anaconda Cloud with.. code-block:: console  conda create --name spec2vec python=3.8  conda activate spec2vec  conda install --channel bioconda --channel conda-forge spec2vecAlternatively, spec2vec can also be installed using ``pip``. When using spec2vec together with ``matchms`` it is important to note that only the Anaconda install will make sure that also ``rdkit`` is installed properly, which is requried for a few matchms filter functions (it is not required for any spec2vec related functionalities though)... code-block:: console  pip install spec2vecExamples========Below a code example of how to process a large data set of reference spectra totrain a word2vec model from scratch. Spectra are converted to documents using ``SpectrumDocument`` which converts spectrum peaks into &quot;words&quot; according to their m/z ratio (for instance &quot;peak@100.39&quot;). A new word2vec model can then trained using ``train_new_word2vec_model`` which will set the training parameters to spec2vec defaults unless specified otherwise. Word2Vec models learn from co-occurences of peaks (&quot;words&quot;) across many different spectra.To get a model that can give a meaningful representation of a set ofgiven spectra it is desirable to train the model on a large and representativedataset... code-block:: python    import os    import matchms.filtering as msfilters    from matchms.importing import load_from_mgf    from spec2vec import SpectrumDocument    from spec2vec.model_building import train_new_word2vec_model    def spectrum_processing(s):        &quot;&quot;&quot;This is how one would typically design a desired pre- and post-        processing pipeline.&quot;&quot;&quot;        s = msfilters.default_filters(s)        s = msfilters.add_parent_mass(s)        s = msfilters.normalize_intensities(s)        s = msfilters.reduce_to_number_of_peaks(s, n_required=10, ratio_desired=0.5, n_max=500)        s = msfilters.select_by_mz(s, mz_from=0, mz_to=1000)        s = msfilters.add_losses(s, loss_mz_from=10.0, loss_mz_to=200.0)        s = msfilters.require_minimum_number_of_peaks(s, n_required=10)        return s    # Load data from MGF file and apply filters    spectrums = [spectrum_processing(s) for s in load_from_mgf(&quot;reference_spectrums.mgf&quot;)]    # Omit spectrums that didn't qualify for analysis    spectrums = [s for s in spectrums if s is not None]    # Create spectrum documents    reference_documents = [SpectrumDocument(s, n_decimals=2) for s in spectrums]    model_file = &quot;references.model&quot;    model = train_new_word2vec_model(reference_documents, iterations=[10, 20, 30], filename=model_file,                                     workers=2, progress_logger=True)Once a word2vec model has been trained, spec2vec allows to calculate the similaritiesbetween mass spectrums based on this model. In cases where the word2vec model wastrained on data different than the data it is applied for, a number of peaks (&quot;words&quot;)might be unknown to the model (if they weren't part of the training dataset). Toaccount for those cases it is important to specify the ``allowed_missing_percentage``,as in the example below... code-block:: python    import gensim    from matchms import calculate_scores    from spec2vec import Spec2Vec    # query_spectrums loaded from files using https://matchms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/matchms.importing.load_from_mgf.html    query_spectrums = [spectrum_processing(s) for s in load_from_mgf(&quot;query_spectrums.mgf&quot;)]    # Omit spectrums that didn't qualify for analysis    query_spectrums = [s for s in query_spectrums if s is not None]    # Import pre-trained word2vec model (see code example above)    model_file = &quot;references.model&quot;    model = gensim.models.Word2Vec.load(model_file)    # Define similarity_function    spec2vec_similarity = Spec2Vec(model=model, intensity_weighting_power=0.5,                                   allowed_missing_percentage=5.0)    # Calculate scores on all combinations of reference spectrums and queries    scores = calculate_scores(reference_documents, query_spectrums, spec2vec_similarity)    # Find the highest scores for a query spectrum of interest    best_matches = scores.scores_by_query(query_documents[0], sort=True)[:10]    # Return highest scores    print([x[1] for x in best_matches])Glossary of terms=================.. list-table::   :header-rows: 1   * - Term     - Description   * - adduct / addition product     - During ionization in a mass spectrometer, the molecules of the injected compound break apart       into fragments. When fragments combine into a new compound, this is known as an addition       product, or adduct.  `Wikipedia &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduct&gt;`__   * - GNPS     - Knowledge base for sharing of mass spectrometry data (`link &lt;https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp&gt;`__).   * - InChI / :code:`INCHI`     - InChI is short for International Chemical Identifier. InChIs are useful       in retrieving information associated with a certain molecule from a       database.   * - InChIKey / InChI key / :code:`INCHIKEY`     - An indentifier for molecules. For example, the InChI key for carbon       dioxide is :code:`InChIKey=CURLTUGMZLYLDI-UHFFFAOYSA-N` (yes, it       includes the substring :code:`InChIKey=`).   * - MGF File / Mascot Generic Format     - A plan ASCII file format to store peak list data from a mass spectrometry experiment.

It can be recalculated from the precursor m/z by taking       into account the charge state and proton/electron masses.   * - precursor m/z / :code:`precursor_mz`     - Mass-to-charge ratio of the compound targeted for fragmentation.   * - SMILES     - A line notation for describing the structure of chemical species using       short ASCII strings. For example, water is encoded as :code:`O[H]O`,       carbon dioxide is encoded as :code:`O=C=O`, etc. SMILES-encoded species may be converted to InChIKey `using a resolver like this one &lt;https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure&gt;`__.
