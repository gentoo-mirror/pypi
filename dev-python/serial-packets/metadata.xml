	<longdescription># Python Serial Packets**NOTE**: As of June 21 2023, the **wire format changed** to have distinctpacket start and stop flag bytes.Python implementations of the Serial Packets protocol.* PYPI: &lt;https://pypi.org/project/serial-packets/&gt;* Github: &lt;https://github.com/zapta/serial_packets_py&gt;Related works:* Simple HDLC: &lt;https://github.com/wuttem/simple-hdlc&gt;* ArduHDLC: &lt;https://github.com/jarkko-hautakorpi/Arduhdlc&gt;* Firmata: &lt;https://github.com/firmata/arduino&gt;## Protocol DescriptionThe Serial Packets protocol provides packet based point-to-point serial transport for communication between devices. For example, it can be used to connect an Arduino device to a PC, where the PC controls the device, and the device sends data in real time back to the PC. The protocol is fully symmetrical such that both sides to the communication have the same capabilities, with no designation of master/slave at the transport level.### Highlights* Protocol is packet oriented, saving the need to implement framing by the application.* The protocol is efficient with low per-packet overhead, and minimal memory and computation requirements.* The protocol is symmetrical, and both sides can initiate or response to interactions.* The protocol is full duplex, and works independently on each direction.* The protocol support endpoint addressing to simplify routing of messages within the application.* The protocol supports both one way and two way request/response interactions.* Each packet is verified with a 16 bits CRC.* The protocol uses the HDLC byte stuffing algorithm which allow to resync on next frame despite line errors.* The wire representation is intuitive which simplifies debugging.* The protocol is connectionless and stateless, though application can implement the notion of connection and state at their layer.### CommandsCommands are round-trip interactions where one node send a 'command' packet receives as 'response' packet from the other node. Commands can be used for example the device and to retrieve information selectedinformation.The following tables lists the fields of command request and response  packets respectively. Note that this is not the exact wire representation since the packets are subject to flagging and byte stuffing as explained later.#### Command packet| Field       | Size [bytes] | Source   | Description                                            || :---------- | :----------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------- || PACKET_TYPE | 1            | Auto     | The value 0x01                                         || CMD_ID      | 4            | Auto     | A unique command id for response matching. Big Endian. || END_POINT   | 1            | **User** | The target endpoint of this command.                   || DATA        | 0 to 1024    | **User** | Command data.                                          || CRC         | 2            | Auto     | Packet CRC. Big endian.                                |#### Response packet| Field       | Size [bytes] | Source   | Description                                 || :---------- | :----------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------ || PACKET_TYPE | 1            | Auto     | The value 0x02                              || CMD_ID      | 4            | Auto     | The ID of the original command. Big Endian. || STATUS      | 1            | **User** | Response status.                            || DATA        | 0 to 1024    | **User** | Response data.                              || CRC         | 2            | Auto     | Packet CRC. Big endian.                     |#### Sending a commandThe SerialPacketsClient class provides two methods for sending commands.*send_command_future(...)* for sending using a future that provides the response and *send_command_blocking(...)* which is a convenience method that blocks internally on the future.Future base command sending:```pythonclient = SerialPacketsClient(&quot;COM1&quot;, my_command_async_callback, my_message_async_callback,  my_event_async_callback)is_connected = await client.connect()assert(is_connected)endpoint = 20cmd_data = PacketData()cmd_data.add_uint8(0x01)cmd_data.add_uint16(0x0203)future =  client.send_command_future(endpoint, cmd_data, timeout=0.2)# Sometime laterstatus, rsp_data = await future```Blocking style command sending:```pythonclient = SerialPacketsClient(&quot;COM1&quot;, my_command_async_callback, my_message_async_callback, my_event_async_callback)is_connected = await client.connect()assert(is_connected)endpoint = 20cmd_data = PacketData()cmd_data.add_uint8(0x01)cmd_data.add_uint16(0x0203)rx_status, rx_data = await client.send_command_blocking(endpoint, cmd_data, timeout=0.2)```#### Receiving a commandIncoming commands are received via an optional callback function that is passed to the SerialPacketsClient when it's created. The callback is an async function that receives the command's endpoint and data,  and returns the response's status and data. The client uses a pool of asyncio worker tasks that serves incoming packets, and therefore it's okfor the command handler to perform asyncio await operations as part of serving the command. If the command is not handled, the callback function should return the status UNHANDLED.value and empty data.```pythonasync def command_async_callback(endpoint: int, data: PacketData) -&gt; Tuple[int, PacketData]:    logger.info(f&quot;Received command: [%d] %s&quot;, endpoint, data.hex_bytes())    if (endpoint == 20):        v1 = data.read_uint8()        v2 = data.read_uint16()        if not data.all_read_ok():          logger.info(f&quot;Errors parsing command&quot;, status, response_data.hex(sep=' '))          return (PacketStatus.INVALID_ARGUMENT.value, PacketData())        response_data = PacketData()        response_dat.add_uint32(0x12345678)        logger.info(f&quot;Command response: [%d] %s&quot;, PacketStatus.OK.value, response_data.hex(sep=' '))    # Add here handling of additional command end points.    return (PacketStatus.UNHANDLED.value, bytearray())client = SerialPacketsClient(args.port, command_async_callback, message_async_callback, event_async_callback)is_connected = await client.connect()assert(is_connected)```### MessagesMessages are a simpler case of a commands with no response. They are useful for periodic notifications, for example for data reporting, and have lower overhead than commands.#### Message packet| Field       | Size [bytes] | Source   | Description                          || :---------- | :----------- | :------- | :----------------------------------- || PACKET_TYPE | 1            | Auto     | The value 0x03                       || END_POINT   | 1            | **User** | The target endpoint of this command. || DATA        | 0 to 1024    | **User** | Command data.                        || CRC         | 2            | Auto     | Packet CRC. Big endian.              |#### Sending a messageThe *SerialPacketsClient* class provides a method for sending a command. The method is non blocking and merely queues the message for sending.two methods for sending commands.```pythonclient = SerialPacketsClient(&quot;COM1&quot;, command_async_callback, message_async_callback, event_async_callback)is_connected = await client.connect()assert(is_connected)...endpoint = 20data = PacketData()data.add_uint16(12345)client.send_message(endpoint, data)```#### Receiving a messageIncoming messages are received via a callback function that is passed to the SerialPacketsClient when it's created. The callback is an async function that receives the target endpoint and the data of the message and returns no value.```pythonasync def message_async_callback(endpoint: int, data: bytearray) -&gt; Tuple[int, PacketData]:    logger.info(f&quot;Received message: [%d] %s&quot;, endpoint, data.hex(sep=' '))    if endpoint == 20:        v1 = data.read_uint16()        v2 = data.read_uint16()        if v1.read_all_ok():          logger.info(f&quot;Message data: {v1} {v2}&quot;)    else:      logger.error(f&quot;Unhandled message at endpoint {endpoint}&quot;)client = SerialPacketsClient(args.port, my_command_async_callback, my_message_async_callback, my_event_async_callback)is_connected = await client.connect()assert(is_connected)```## EventsThe SerialPacketsClient signals the application about certain events via an events callback that the use pass to it upon initialization.```pythonasync def event_async_callback(event: PacketsEvent) -&gt; None:    logger.info(&quot;Event %s: %s&quot;, event.event_type(), event.description())    logger.info(&quot;%s event&quot;, event)client = SerialPacketsClient(args.port, command_async_callback, message_async_callback, event_async_callback)is_connected = await client.connect()assert(is_connected)``````python```As of May 2023 only a couple of events are supported.  ```pythonclass PacketsEventType(Enum):    CONNECTED = 1    DISCONNECTED = 2```## PacketData classPacket data is represented by instances of the class PacketData which also provides a simple serialization/deserialization API.Serialization methods:```pythonadd_uint8(v)   # Adds a single byte unsigned integer valueadd_uint16(v)  # Adds a two byte unsigned integer valueadd_uint32(v)  # Adds a four byte unsigned integer valueadd_bytes(v)   # Adds an arbitrary number of bytes```&gt; ***NOTE:***  Variable length string and data can be encoded as a byte count followed by the byte themselves. .Deserialization methods:```pythonv = read_uint8()    # Read a single byte unsigned integer valuev = read_uint16(v)  # Read a two byte unsigned integer valuev = read_uint32(v)  # Read a four byte unsigned integer valuev = read_bytes(v)   # Read an arbitrary number of bytes```&gt; ***NOTE:***  If any of the read methods encounter an error, it returns None and sets the internal read error flag of the PacketData, whichwill force all future read methods to fail as well..Deserialization control methods:```pythonbytes_read() -&gt; int            # Returns number of bytes returned so far.bytes_left_to_read() -&gt; int    # Returns the count of data bytes that have not been read yet.read_error() -&gt; int            # Tests if read errors where encountered so far.all_read() -&gt; bool             # Tests if all data were read.     all_read_ok() -&gt; bool          # Tests if all data read with no errors.reset_read_location() -&gt; None  # Resets read pointer and error flag.```Utility methods:```pythonhex_str() -&gt; str    # Returns an hex representation fo the data, for debugging.data_bytes() -&gt; bytearray  # Returns a copy of the data bytes.size() -&gt; int  # Returns the number of data bytes.clear() -&gt; None # Clear the data and reset the read location and error flag..```## Wire representation### Packet start/stop flagsThe Serial Packets protocol uses packet flags inspired from the HDLC protocol, with the special flag bytes 0X7C, 0x7E indicating the beginning and end of a packet, respectively.### Byte stuffingTo make the flag bytes 0X7C, 0x7E unique in the serial stream, the Serial Packet uses 'byte stuffing' borrowed from the HDLC protocol. This allows the protocol to resync on next packet boundary, in case of line errors. This byte stuffing is done using the escape byte 0X7D| Packet byte | Wire bytes | Comments            || :---------- | :--------- | :------------------ || 0x7C        | 0x7D, 0x5C | Escaped start flag  || 0x7D        | 0x7D, 0x5D | Escaped escape byte || 0x7E        | 0x7D, 0x5E | Escaped end flag    || Other bytes | No change  | The common case     |Example of a command packet:```pythonStuffed command packet: 0x7c, 0x01, 0xff, 0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x20, 0xff,  0x00, 0x7d, 0x5c, 0x11, 0x7d, 0x5e, 0x22, 0x7d,  0x5d, 0x99, 0x7a, 0xa7, 0x7eBreakdown into parts:start flag:   0x7cpacket_type:  0x01cmd_id:       0xff, 0x12, 0x34, 0x56endpoint:     0x20data:         0xff, 0x00, 0x7d, 0x5c, 0x11, 0x7d, 0x5e, 0x22, 0x7d, 0x5d, 0x99crc:          0x7a, 0xa7flag:         0x7e# In this examples, only the data part contains escaped bytes and its# unescaped version is:data:  0xff, 0x00, 0x7c, 0x11, 0x7e, 0x22, 0x7d, 0x99```## Status codesThe Serial Packets protocol uses 1 byte status codes where 0x00 indicates success and all other values indicate errors. These status codes are used in the command responses, and optionally also by the implementation API for other reasons.As of May 2023, these are the predefined status codes. For the updated list, look at the *serial_packets.packets.PacketStatus* enum.| Status Value | Status name      | Comments                             || :----------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------- || 0            | OK               | The only non error status.           || 1            | GENERAL_ERROR    | Unspecified error.                   || 2            | TIMEOUT          | A request timed out.                 || 3            | UNHANDLED        | No handler for this command.         || 4            | INVALID_ARGUMENT | Invalid argument value in a request. || 5            | LENGTH_ERROR     | Data has invalid length.             || 6            | OUT_OF_RANGE     | A more specific invalid argument.    || 7 - 99       | Reserved         | For future protocol definitions.     || 100-255      | Custom           | For user's application specific use. |## EndpointsEndpoints represent the destinations of commands and messages on the receiving node and allows the application to distinguish between command and message types. End points are identified by a single byte, where the values 0-199 are available for the application, and the values 200-255 are reserved for future expansions of the protocol.## Application ExampleThe repository contains and example with two main programs that communicate between them via serial port. One program called 'master' periodically sends a command and waits for a response and the other one called 'slave' sends a message periodically. To run the example, use two USB/Serial adapters and connect the TX of the first to the RX of the second and vice versa. Also, make sure to connect the gwo grounds. Then run each of the two program, providing the respective port in the command line. Make sure to replace the serial port ids in the example below with the actual port id of your system.&lt;https://github.com/zapta/serial_packets_py/tree/main/src/examples&gt;Running the master:```pythonpython -u  master.py --port=&quot;COM21&quot; ```Running the slave (in another shell, or another computer):```pythonpython -u  slave.py --port=&quot;COM22&quot; ```## FAQ**Q**: What other Serial Packets implementations are available?A: This Python implementation is the first.
