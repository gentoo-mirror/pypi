	<longdescription># DescriptionNested dictionary structures emerge every time there is some sort hierarchyin the data. Trees, archives, the chapters and sections in a book, these are all examples where you will likely find nested loops of data.Python does not have a built-in data type for nested mappings. Dictionaries can be used, however there many inconveniences and limitations.Two above all: getting items requires to open and close several square brackets (eg. `d[level1][level2]...[levelN]`), and iterating will only access the first layer, so nested for loops are needed to iterate through all the values.The `ndicts` package aims to tackle the main issues of nested dictionaries, exposing an interface with minimum differences from dictionaries themselves.`NestedDict` is a `MutableMapping` at its core, therefore all familiar dictionary methods are available and the overall behaviour similar.If you need to perform simple mathematical operations with your nested data,use `DataDict`. In addition to allowing arithmetics, `DataDicts` borrow some methods that you would expect from a `pandas` `DataFrame`. Finally, this is a simple project for simple needs. Consider using `pandas` `MultiIndex` for more functionalities!# InstallationInstall `ndicts` with `pip`.```commandlinepip install ndicts```# OverviewImport `NestedDict` and `DataDict`.```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; from ndicts import DataDict, NestedDict```Create a `NestedDict` from a dictionary.```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; book = {...     &quot;Book 1&quot;: {...         &quot;Section 1&quot;: &quot;The Eve of the War&quot;,...         &quot;Section 2&quot;: &quot;The Falling Star&quot;...     },...     &quot;Book 2&quot;: {...         &quot;Section 1&quot;: &quot;Under Foot&quot;, ...         &quot;Section 2&quot;: {&quot;Paragraph 1&quot;: &quot;After eating we crept back to the scullery&quot;}...     }... }&gt;&gt;&gt; nd = NestedDict(book)```Get items more conveniently than with standard dictionaries.```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; # NestedDict&gt;&gt;&gt; nd[&quot;Book 1&quot;, &quot;Section 1&quot;] 'The Eve of the War'&gt;&gt;&gt; # dict&gt;&gt;&gt; book[&quot;Book 1&quot;][&quot;Section 2&quot;]'The Falling Star'```Iterate over a `NestedDict`.```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; for key in nd:...     print(key)('Book 1', 'Section 1')('Book 1', 'Section 2')('Book 2', 'Section 1')('Book 2', 'Section 2', 'Paragraph 1')```# Documentationhttps://edd313.github.io/ndicts/# Licence`ndicts` is licensed under the MIT license.</longdescription>
