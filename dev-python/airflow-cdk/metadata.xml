	<longdescription># airflow-cdkThis project makes it simple to deploy airflow via ECS fargate using the aws cdk in Python.## Usage**There are two main ways that this package can be used.**### Standalone PackageFor those already familiar with the aws cdk, add this projectas a dependency i.e. `pip install airflow-cdk`  and/or add to `requirement.txt` and use the `FargateAirflow`construct like so.```python3from aws_cdk import corefrom airflow_cdk import FargateAirflowapp = core.App()FargateAirflow(    app,    &quot;airflow-cdk&quot;,    postgres_password=&quot;replacethiswithasecretpassword&quot;)app.synth()````cdk deploy`That's it.### CloningYou can also clone this repository and alter the `FargateAirflow` constructto your heart's content.That also provides you an added benefit of utilizing the `tasks.py` taskswith [invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org) to do things like create new dags easilyi.e. `inv new-dag`You would then also easily be able to use the existing docker-compose for local developmentwith some minor modifications for your setup.The easiest way to get started would be just a one-line change to the `app.py` example aboveand to the `docker-compose.yml` file.```python3from aws_cdk import corefrom airflow_cdk import FargateAirflowapp = core.App()FargateAirflow(    app,    &quot;airflow-cdk&quot;,    postgres_password=&quot;replacethiswithasecretpassword&quot;),    # this is the only change to make when cloning    base_image=aws_ecs.ContainerImage.from_asset(&quot;.&quot;)app.synth()```Then, in the `docker-compose.yml` file, simply delete, comment out, or change the image namefor the `image: knowsuchagency/airflow-cdk` line in `x-airflow`.Now the same container that would be created by `docker-compose build` will be deployed to ECS for your web, worker, and scheduler images by `cdk deploy`.## ComponentsThe following aws resources will be deployed as ecs tasks within the same cluster and vpc by default:* an airflow webserver task  * and an internet-facing application load-balancer* an airflow scheduler task* an airflow worker task  * (note) it will auto-scale based on cpu and memory usage up to a total of 16 instances at a time by default starting from 1* a rabbitmq broker  * an application load balancer that will allow you to log in to    the rabbitmq management console with the default user/pw guest/guest* an rds instance* an s3 bucket for logs## Why is this awesome?Apart from the fact that we're able to describe our infrastructure using the same language and codebase we use to author our dags?Since we're using cloudformation under-the-hood, whenever we change a part of our code or infrastructure, only thosechanges that are different from our last deployment will be deployed.Meaning, if all we do is alter the code we want to run on our deployment, we simply re-build and publish our dockercontainer (which is done for us if we use `aws_ecs.ContainerImage.from_asset(&quot;.&quot;)`) prior to `cdk deploy`!Existing users of airflow will know how tricky it can be to manage deployments when you want to distinguish betweenpushing changes to your codebase i.e. dags and actual infrastructure deployments.We just have to be careful not to deploy while we have some long-running worker task we don't want to interrupt since fargate will replace those worker instances with new ones running our updated code. Now there's basically no distinction.## Notes* Before running `cdk destroy`, you will want to empty the s3 bucket that's created otherwise the command may fail at  that stage and the bucket can be left in a state that makes it difficult to delete later on## TODOs* create a custom component to deploy airflow to an ec2 cluster* improve documentation* (possibly) subsume the [airflow stable helm chart](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/stable/airflow) as a cdk8s chart## Contributions Welcome!</longdescription>
