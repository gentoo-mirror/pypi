	<longdescription># conventional-pre-commitA [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) hook to check commit messages for[Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) formatting.Works with Python &gt;= 3.8.## UsageMake sure `pre-commit` is [installed](https://pre-commit.com#install).Create a blank configuration file at the root of your repo, if needed:```consoletouch .pre-commit-config.yaml```Add a new repo entry to your configuration file:```yamlrepos:  # - repo: ...  - repo: https://github.com/compilerla/conventional-pre-commit    rev: &lt;git sha or tag&gt;    hooks:      - id: conventional-pre-commit        stages: [commit-msg]        args: []```Install the `pre-commit` script:```consolepre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg```Make a (normal) commit :x::```console$ git commit -m &quot;add a new feature&quot;[INFO] Initializing environment for ....Conventional Commit......................................................Failed- hook id: conventional-pre-commit- duration: 0.07s- exit code: 1[Bad Commit message] &gt;&gt; add a new featureYour commit message does not follow Conventional Commits formattinghttps://www.conventionalcommits.org/Conventional Commits start with one of the below types, followed by a colon,followed by the commit message:    build chore ci docs feat fix perf refactor revert style testExample commit message adding a feature:    feat: implement new APIExample commit message fixing an issue:    fix: remove infinite loopExample commit with scope in parentheses after the type for more context:    fix(account): remove infinite loopExample commit with a body:    fix: remove infinite loop    Additional information on the issue caused by the infinite loop```Make a (conventional) commit :heavy_check_mark::```console$ git commit -m &quot;feat: add a new feature&quot;[INFO] Initializing environment for ....Conventional Commit......................................................Passed- hook id: conventional-pre-commit- duration: 0.05s```## Install with pip`conventional-pre-commit` can also be installed and used from the command line:```shellpip install conventional-pre-commit```Then run the command line script:```shellconventional-pre-commit [types] input```- `[types]` is an optional list of Conventional Commit types to allow (e.g. `feat fix chore`)- `input` is a file containing the commit message to check:```shellconventional-pre-commit feat fix chore ci test .git/COMMIT_MSG```Or from a Python program:```pythonfrom conventional_pre_commit.format import is_conventional# prints Trueprint(is_conventional(&quot;feat: this is a conventional commit&quot;))# prints Falseprint(is_conventional(&quot;nope: this is not a conventional commit&quot;))# prints Trueprint(is_conventional(&quot;custom: this is a conventional commit&quot;, types=[&quot;custom&quot;]))```## Passing `args``conventional-pre-commit` supports a number of arguments to configure behavior:```shell$ conventional-pre-commit -husage: conventional-pre-commit [-h] [--force-scope] [--strict] [types ...] inputCheck a git commit message for Conventional Commits formatting.positional arguments:  types          Optional list of types to support  input          A file containing a git commit messageoptions:  -h, --help     show this help message and exit  --force-scope  Force commit to have scope defined.  --strict       Force commit to strictly follow Conventional Commits formatting. Disallows fixup! style commits.```Supply arguments on the command-line, or via the pre-commit `hooks.args` property:```yamlrepos:  - repo: https://github.com/compilerla/conventional-pre-commit    rev: &lt;git sha or tag&gt;    hooks:      - id: conventional-pre-commit        stages: [commit-msg]        args: [--strict, --force-scope, feat, fix, chore, test, custom]```**NOTE:** when using as a pre-commit hook, `input` is supplied automatically (with the current commit's message).## Development`conventional-pre-commit` comes with a [VS Code devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/develop-cloud/containers)configuration to provide a consistent development environment.With the `Remote - Containers` extension enabled, open the folder containing this repository inside Visual Studio Code.You should receive a prompt in the Visual Studio Code window; click `Reopen in Container` to run the development environmentinside the devcontainer.If you do not receive a prompt, or when you feel like starting from a fresh environment:1. `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` to bring up the command palette in Visual Studio Code1. Type `Remote-Containers` to filter the commands1. Select `Rebuild and Reopen in Container` to completely rebuild the devcontainer1. Select `Reopen in Container` to reopen the most recent devcontainer build## VersioningVersioning generally follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).## Making a releaseReleases to PyPI and GitHub are triggered by pushing a tag.1. Ensure all changes for the release are present in the `main` branch1. Tag with the new version: `git tag vX.Y.Z` for regular release, `git tag vX.Y.Z-preN` for pre-release1. Push the new version tag: `git push origin vX.Y.Z`## License[Apache 2.0](LICENSE)Inspired by matthorgan's [`pre-commit-conventional-commits`](https://github.com/matthorgan/pre-commit-conventional-commits).</longdescription>
