	<longdescription># Django microservice auth SDK# Django auth DB router.Simple database router that helps to split your main database and authentication database.This may be necessary when splitting a project into microservices.Let's say you have some Django project and want to split it into microservices.But all of your microservices need to use the same authentication database.This router will help you to do that.---## How it works  1. Django project that provides authentication also shares default database with other microservices.  2. Other microservices may have their own databases, but they all use the same authentication database.  Which apps are routed to `auth_db` database?- `contenttypes`- `sites`- `auth`- `admin`- `flatpages`- `redirects`- `auditlog`- `sessions`  Models of these apps are routed to `auth_db` database.   These apps are hardcoded in `ms_auth_router.routers.DefaultRouter`.    List can be extended by adding `ROUTE_APP_LABELS` setting.    &gt; If you know that some reusable Django apps should be routed to `auth_db` database, please create an issue or pull request.## Quickstart    Add `ms_auth_router` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting like this:```pythonINSTALLED_APPS = [    ...,    'ms_auth_router',    ...]```Add `DATABASE_ROUTERS` setting in `settings.py` file or append to existing list:```pythonDATABASE_ROUTERS = [    'ms_auth_router.routers.DefaultRouter',    ...]```Add `auth_db` section to `DATABASES`:```pyconDATABASES = {   ...   'auth_db': {       'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',       'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'auth.sqlite3',   },   ...}```Finally, add `AUTH_DB` setting:```pythonAUTH_DB = 'auth_db'```Without this setting router will use `default` db connection.    &gt; Note: To get session authentication working between microservices, the `SECRET_KEY` setting must be the same &gt; in all microservices.## Use with custom auth app    If you're using custom auth app and want it to be routed to `auth_db` database, you need to add `ROUTE_APP_LABELS` setting:```pythonROUTE_APP_LABELS = ['my_custom_auth_app', ]```    </longdescription>
