	<longdescription># FreeAgent APIA package for interacting with the [FreeAgent](https://freeagent.com/)accounting software.Mainly made for personal use, but sharing it here because... well, why not? :-)## LimitationsCurrently only invoice related functionality is available. Other features arelikely to be added in time.## Install from PyPI```shpip install freeagent_api```## Usage```pythonimport freeagent_apiapi = freeagent_api.ApiClient(    client_id = '&lt;client id from dev.freeagent.com&gt;',    client_secret = '&lt;client secret from dev.freeagent.com&gt;',    use_sandbox = True,)# Load a serialised token from wherever you store them hereapi.serialised_token = your_storage.get_token() # Implement this yourself# or ask the user to authorise access to their accountapi.do_auth()# Get some basic info about the authenticated useruser = api.get_user()company = api.get_company()print(f&quot;{user.fullname} works for {company.name}&quot;)print()# Find unpaid invoicesfor invoice in api.get_invoices(status = &quot;open_or_overdue&quot;):    print(f&quot;Invoice {invoice.reference} for {invoice.currency} {invoice.total_value} is unpaid&quot;)# Store the authentication token for later usestorage.set_token(api.serialised_token) # Implement this yourself```This will, assuming appropriate invoices exist, display something along thelines of:```textTim the Enchanter works for Arthurian Enchanters LtdInvoice ART01 for GBP 112.15 is unpaidInvoice ART02 for USD 245.10 is unpaidInvoice RBT01 for GBP 2.50 is unpaid```## Available dataSee FreeAgent's [official API documentation](https://dev.freeagent.com/docs/)for the basic fields in each object.
