	<longdescription>&lt;img width=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://batou.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/batou.png&quot;&gt;batou helps you to automate your application deployments:* You create a model of your deployment using a simple but powerful Python API.* You configure how the model applies to hosts in different environments.* You verify and run the deployment with the batou utility.Getting started with a new project is easy:```consolemkdir myprojectcd myprojectgit initcurl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyingcircusio/batou/main/bootstrap | shgit commit -m &quot;Start a batou project.&quot;```Here's a minimal application model:```console$ mkdir -p components/myapp$ cat &gt; components/myapp/component.pyfrom batou.component import Componentfrom batou.lib.python import VirtualEnv, Packagefrom batou.lib.supervisor import Programclass MyApp(Component):    def configure(self):        venv = VirtualEnv('2.7')        self += venv        venv += Package('myapp')        self += Program('myapp',            command='bin/myapp')```And here's a minimal environment:```console$ mkdir environments$ cat &gt; environments/dev/environment.cfg[environment]connect_method = local[hosts]localhost = myapp```To deploy this, you run:```console$ ./batou deploy dev```Check the [detailed documentation](http://batou.readthedocs.org) to get going with a more ambitious project.## Features* Separate your application model from environments* Supports idempotent operation for incremental deployments* Deploy to multiple hosts simultaneously* Automated dependency resolution for multi-host scenarios* No runtime requirements on your application* Encrypted secrets with multiple access levels: store your  SSL certificates, SSH keys, service secrets and more to get true 1-button deployments.* Deploy to local machines, Vagrant, or any SSH host* Broad SSH feature support by using OpenSSH through execnet* Only few dependencies required on the remote host* Ships with a library of components for regularly needed tasks* self-bootstrapping and self-updating - no additional scripting needed## LicenseThe project is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license.## Hacking* Make sure `mercurial` and `subversion` are installed and in `$PATH`.* `python27` also needs to be installed and in `$PATH`.* Run `./develop.sh` to create a local virtualenv with everything set up.* Run the test suite using: `bin/tox`* Build the documentation using: `cd doc; make`* Set up GPG for the examples with `export GNUPGHOME=&lt;DIRECTORY OF BATOU HERE&gt;/src/batou/secrets/tests/fixture/gnupg`## ChangelogSee [CHANGES.md](./CHANGES.md).</longdescription>
