It aims to reduce re-using of generic code between similar projects, which leads to bug duplication and further security vulnerabilities. Building upon this, another mission of this package is to install Urban Intelligence's style guides by modifying the matplotlib installation and installing fonts. ## Main Features  - Easy uploading of files to Amazon Web Services S3 buckets, and appropriate versioning control for data cache handling  - Creating colour palettes relating to Urban Intelligence's main products  - Connecting (and creating) databases on postgreSQL servers, as well as uploading DataFrames to a database  - Bulk querying (public and private) ESRI servers to download geometric data with attributes  - Connecting to Linux servers (e.g. Piwakawaka) to execute terminal commands, as well as uploading files and/or whole directories to the server  - Quickly send messages or files to a Slack channel or person  - Calculate statistics of raster files over a polygon geometry (&quot;zonal statistics&quot;)  - Quickly convert a GeoDataFrame to a simplified topojson file  - Bulk querying (public and private) OGC Web Feature Services (WFS) to download geometric data with attributes  - Determine the fastest transportation route between a set of origins and destinations## Where to get itThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: [https://github.com/uintel/pyui](https://github.com/uintel/pyui)Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/uintel) by running:```shpip install uintel```&gt; If `pip install uintel` fails due to required packages that are known to be tricky, such as GDAL, the binary distributions can be downloaded from: [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs). &gt; For more convenience on Windows, `pip install pipwin` and `pipwin install gdal` is an approach that downloads the right binary wheel from Christoph Gohlke.&gt; For Linux distributions, check the available version of GDAL by running `ogrinfo --version` and then perform `pip install gdal==available_version`. Typically on our analyst computers, the available version is 3.0.4.## ConfigurationEach time ```uintel``` is imported,```pyimport uintel as ui```all necessary installations shall begin that have not been completed before. This will include creating a configuration file, installing fonts and modifying matplotlib - if it has not been done so before.If you have adjusted your computer and the UI defaults have altered, you can revert them by running:```pyui.reset_fonts()ui.reset_styles()ui.reset_config()```## DocumentationDocumentation is available at [https://uintel.github.io/pyui/](https://uintel.github.io/pyui/)</longdescription>
