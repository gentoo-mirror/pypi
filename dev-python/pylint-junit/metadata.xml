	<longdescription>pylint_junit============Pylint plugin that generates JUnit based report that can be consumedby CI environments like Jenkins, Azure Devops and such.Why ?=====At the time of writing, few tools existed that where able to generateJUnit format from pylint output. Both of these projects where nothandling &quot;empty&quot; results scenario well, eg both cases generated an emptyfile and that caused issues in ci as the resulting document was notproper xml file. Another issue was that issues found by pylint wheremarked under single testcase failure and this caused atleast Azure toreport a single item per file even thought there could have been multiple.Thus, pylint_junit was written.Installation============Install the package with.. code-block::   pip install pylint_junitor add it to your requirements.Usage=====After the plugin has been installed there are few options to take it into use.Add following lines into your .pylintrc:.. code-block::   [MASTER]   load-plugins=pylint_junit   [REPORTS]   output-format=junitThis does set the default output to junit, so if still want to run pylint and getnormal output, you might want to consider omitting the &quot;output-format=junit&quot;portion and only when junit format is needed, provide it via command line like this:.. code-block::   pylint --output-format=junit src/Or, without making any changes to your pylint configuration, you can just pass the classas report formatter like this:.. code-block::   pylint --output-format=pylint_junit.JUnitReporter src/Dependencies============* junit_xml____ https://github.com/kyrus/python-junit-xmlBugs / Feedback===============Use Github Issues Tracker @ https://github.com/rasjani/pylint_junit/issues</longdescription>
