I was heavily relying on this library for other projects butcould not proceed due to the limitations.Some noticeable ones that bother me the most:- hard limit on `prompt_toolkit` version 1.0.3- various color issues- various cursor issues- No options for VI/Emacs navigation key bindings- Pagination option doesn't workThis project uses python3.7+ type hinting with focus on resolving above issues while providing greater customisation options.## Requirements### OSLeveraging [prompt_toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit), `InquirerPy` works cross platform for all OS. Although Unix platform may have a better experience than Windows.### Python```python &gt;= 3.7```## Getting StartedCheckout full documentation **[here](https://inquirerpy.readthedocs.io/)**.### Install```shpip3 install InquirerPy```### Quick Start#### Classic Syntax (PyInquirer)```pythonfrom InquirerPy import promptquestions = [    {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;input&quot;, &quot;message&quot;: &quot;What's your name:&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;name&quot;},    {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;confirm&quot;, &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Confirm?&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;confirm&quot;},]result = prompt(questions)name = result[&quot;name&quot;]confirm = result[&quot;confirm&quot;]```#### Alternate Syntax```pythonfrom InquirerPy import inquirername = inquirer.text(message=&quot;What's your name:&quot;).execute()confirm = inquirer.confirm(message=&quot;Confirm?&quot;).execute()```&lt;!-- start migration --&gt;## Migrating from PyInquirerMost APIs from [PyInquirer](https://github.com/CITGuru/PyInquirer) should be compatible with `InquirerPy`. If you have discovered more incompatible APIs, pleasecreate an issue or directly update README via a pull request.### EditorPrompt`InquirerPy` does not support [editor](https://github.com/CITGuru/PyInquirer#editor---type-editor) prompt as of now.### CheckboxPromptThe following table contains the mapping of incompatible parameters.| PyInquirer      | InquirerPy      || --------------- | --------------- || pointer_sign    | pointer         || selected_sign   | enabled_symbol  || unselected_sign | disabled_symbol |### StyleEvery style keys from [PyInquirer](https://github.com/CITGuru/PyInquirer) is present in `InquirerPy` except the ones in the following table.| PyInquirer | InquirerPy || ---------- | ---------- || selected   | pointer    |Although `InquirerPy` support all the keys from [PyInquirer](https://github.com/CITGuru/PyInquirer), the styling works slightly different.Please refer to the [Style](https://inquirerpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/style.html) documentation for detailed information.&lt;!-- end migration --&gt;## Similar projects### questionary[questionary](https://github.com/tmbo/questionary) is a fantastic fork which supports `prompt_toolkit` 3.0.0+ with performance improvement and more customisation options.It's already a well established and stable library.Comparing with [questionary](https://github.com/tmbo/questionary), `InquirerPy` offers even more customisation options in styles, UI as well as key bindings. `InquirerPy` also provides a newand powerful [fuzzy](https://inquirerpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/prompts/fuzzy.html) prompt.### python-inquirer[python-inquirer](https://github.com/magmax/python-inquirer) is another great Python port of [Inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/). Instead of using `prompt_toolkit`, itleverages the library `blessed` to implement the UI.Before implementing `InquirerPy`, this library came up as an alternative. It's a more stable library comparing to the original [PyInquirer](https://github.com/CITGuru/PyInquirer), howeverit has a rather limited customisation options and an older UI which did not solve the issues I was facing described in the [Motivation](#Motivation) section.Comparing with [python-inquirer](https://github.com/magmax/python-inquirer), `InquirerPy` offers a slightly better UI,more customisation options in key bindings and styles, providing pagination as well as more prompts.## CreditThis project is based on the great work done by the following projects &amp; their authors.- [PyInquirer](https://github.com/CITGuru/PyInquirer)- [prompt_toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit)## LicenseThis project is licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/kazhala/InquirerPy/blob/master/LICENSE).</longdescription>
