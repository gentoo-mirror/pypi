	<longdescription>TensorFlow Lattice is a library that implements fast-to-evaluate andinterpretable (optionally monotonic) lattice based models, which are also knownas *interpolated look-up tables*. The library includes a collection ofEstimators, which operate like any TensorFlow Estimator. It also includesKeras layers for lattices and feature calibration that can be composedinto custom models.</longdescription>
