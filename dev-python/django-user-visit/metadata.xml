	<longdescription># django-user-visitDjango app for recording daily user visits#### CompatibilityThis package supports Python 3.8 and above and Django 3.2 and above.## Upgrading from v1 to v2v2 added three new denormalised fields extracted from the User Agentstring - device, os, browser - to make it easier to analyse directlyin the database.If you want to backfill historical data you will need to run themanagement command `update_user_visit_user_agent_data` after theupgrade.---This app consists of middleware to record user visits, and a single`UserVisit` model to capture that data.The principal behind this is _not_ to record every single request madeby a user. It is to record each daily visit to a site.The one additional factor is that it will record a single daily visitper session / device / ip combination. This means that if a user visitsa site multiple times from the same location / same device, withoutlogging out, then they will be recorded once. If the same user logs infrom a different device, IP address, then they will be recorded again.The goal is to record unique daily visits per user 'context' ( wherecontext is the location / device combo).Admin list view:![UserVisit list view](assets/screenshot-admin-list-view.png)Admin edit view:![UserVisit edit view](assets/screenshot-admin-edit-view.png)</longdescription>
