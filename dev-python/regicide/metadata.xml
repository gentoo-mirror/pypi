	<longdescription># RegicideA framework for playing the card game Regicide.## RequirementsThe package requires python version 3.7+ and should be compatible with Linux, Windows and macOS.## InstallationThe Regicide framework can be installed in python using pip.```shell$ pip install regicide```## Usage## ExampleThe following is an example of implementing an agent with custom behavior. In this example the agent will always choose to play the six of diamonds if available. Otherwise, it will choose randomly from the available actions.```pythonimport randomimport regicidefrom regicide import actions, card, playersclass CustomPlayer:    &quot;&quot;&quot;    A player that always plays the Six of Diamonds if possible.    Otherwise it will choose a random action.    &quot;&quot;&quot;    def play(self, state):        legal_actions = state.action_space()        c = card.Card(card.CardSuit.Diamonds, card.CardValue.Six)        special_action = actions.ActionPlay(c)        if special_action in legal_actions:            return special_action        else:            return random.choice(legal_actions)players = [CustomPlayer(), CustomPlayer(), CustomPlayer()]game = regicide.RegicideGame(players, seed=1337)result = game.playout()print(result, game.reward())```## APIThe framework has three submodules: \cd{actions}, \cd{card} and \cd{players}. Each module contains python classes that can be instantiated and used in the framework.### ActionsAvailable actions are:- `Play(card: Card)`- `AnimalCombo(cards: List[Card])`- `Combo(cards: List[Card])`- `Yield()`- `Discard(cards: List[Card])`- `ChangePlayer(id: int)`- `RefillHand`### CardsAvailable cards are:- `Card(suit: CardSuit, value: CardValue)`- `CardSuit` that can be: `Spades`, `Hearts`, `Diamonds`, `Clubs` or `None`.- `CardValue` that can be `Ace`...`King` or the special value `Jester`.### Players- `InputPlayer()` that allows user input for taking actions.- `RandomPlayer(seed: int)`- `MCTSPlayer(playouts: int, num_threads: int, uct_variation: int, use_heuristics: bool)`## CaveatsCurrently, the python package does not support code suggestions in IDE's, making it more difficult to work with the package. This is a result of the method used to generate the python bindings and has no implication on actual performance or correctness of the program.</longdescription>
