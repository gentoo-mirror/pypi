Being reactive, RxSci is especially suited to work on streaming dataand time series.However it can also be used on traditional datasets. Such datasets are processedas bounded streams by RxSci. So it is possible to use RxSci for both streamingdata and file based datasets. This is especially useful when amachine learning model is trained with a dataset and deployed on streaming data. Get Started============This example computes a rolling mean on a window and stride of three elements:.. code:: Python    import rx    import rxsci as rs    source = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]    rx.from_(source).pipe(        rs.state.with_memory_store(rx.pipe(            rs.data.roll(window=3, stride=3, pipeline=rx.pipe(                rs.math.mean(reduce=True),            )),        )),    ).subscribe(        on_next=print    ).. code:: console    2.0    5.0See the`Maki Nage documentation &lt;https://www.makinage.org/doc/makinage-book/latest/index.html&gt;`_for more information.Installation=============RxSci is available on PyPi and can be installed with pip:.. code:: console    python3 -m pip install rxsci</longdescription>
