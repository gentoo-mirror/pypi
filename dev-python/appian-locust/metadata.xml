	<longdescription>.. what_is_appian_locust-inclusion-begin-do-not-remove#######################################What is Appian Locust?#######################################Appian Locust is a wrapper library around `Locust &lt;https://locust.io&gt;`__ for load testing Appian.This library is intended to be used as an alternative to tools such as Jmeter and Load Runner.Appian Locust capabilities- Logging in and logging out- Form interactions (filling/submitting)- Finding and interacting with basic components on a SAIL interface- Navigating to records/reports/sites.. what_is_appian_locust-inclusion-end-do-not-removeFor full documentation, visit the `docs page &lt;https://appian-locust.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`__... disclaimer-inclusion-begin-do-not-remove**Disclaimer:**This library is continuously evolving.Currently the main focus is supporting essential use-cases.We are happy to accept contributions to further extend functionality, address bug fixes and improve usability.Please see the `Contributing &lt;contributing.html&gt;`__ section and feel free to reach out... disclaimer-inclusion-end-do-not-remove.. quick_start-inclusion-begin-do-not-remove************************Quick Installation Guide************************This is a quick guide to getting up and running with the appian-locust library. You will need Python 3.10+ installed on your machine before proceeding.Setup------------1. Install appian-locust using `pip`, for more comprehensive projects we recommend using `pipenv`... code-block:: bash      pip install appian-locustIf using ``pipenv``, simply start from the following ``Pipfile``:.. code-block:: toml    [packages]    appian-locust = {version = &quot;*&quot;}    [requires]    python_version = &quot;3.10&quot;    [pipenv]    allow_prereleases = true2. Run the sample test `example_locustfile.py &lt;https://gitlab.com/appian-oss/appian-locust/-/blob/main/examples/example_locustfile.py&gt;`_... code-block:: bash    locust -f example_locustfile.pyIf everything is set up correctly, you should see a link to the `Locust web interface &lt;https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/quickstart.html#locust-s-web-interface&gt;`_, which you can use to start test runs and view results.* For more information about how to build the workflow for your locust test, see the `How to Write a Locust Test &lt;how_to_write_locust_tests.html&gt;`__ section.* For more information on running locust tests, see the `How to Run Locust &lt;how_to_run_locust.html&gt;`__ section.Build from source----------------------Clone the repository:.. code-block:: bash    git clone -o prod git@gitlab.com:appian-oss/appian-locust.gitInstall the library globally:.. code-block:: bash    pip install -e appian-locustIf you’re using a virtualenv or a dependency management tool (e.g. ``pipenv``), you can do the same type of install, but you will want to be in the context of the virtualenv (i.e. source the virtualenv), and you’ll need to pass the path to the repository you cloned.Note: It’s highly recommended that you use a virtual environment when installing python artifacts. You can follow the instructions `here &lt;https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/&gt;`__ to install virtualenv and pip.If you have issues installing, make sure you have the proper prerequisites installed for Locust and its dependencies.If you're having trouble on Windows, check `here &lt;https://github.com/locustio/locust/issues/1208#issuecomment-569693439&gt;`__Troubleshooting----------------* **&quot;Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known&quot;**  * check that ``host_address`` is specified correctly in your locust test file.* **&quot;Login unsuccessful, no multipart cookie found...make sure credentials are correct&quot;**  * check that `auth` specifies a valid username and password combination for the site you're testing on in your locust test file.* **&quot;General request and response debugging&quot;**  * Add ``self.client.record_mode = True`` to your ``HttpUser`` subclass.  Files will be placed in ``/record_responses`` where the runner is executed... quick_start-inclusion-end-do-not-remove</longdescription>
