Bigraphs consist of networks with embeddable nodes that can be placed *within* other nodes and dynamically restructured.CBS reimagines the bigraph concept. Variables are contained within Stores (the circles in the figure), which can be embeddedin a hierarchy, as shown by the dark edges. Instead of Milner's hyperedges, CBS employs Processes (the rectangles) which connect via wires (dashed edges) to shared variables within the Stores. Processes and Stores form a type of bipartite graph, as illustrated by the dashed edges.In Vivarium, the CBS is used to structure a modular multiscale simulation. Bigraph-viz is part of an effort tostandardize this structure, so that it can be used as an exchange format for multiscale simulations.## Getting Started### DependenciesBefore installing `bigraph-viz`, make sure you have [Graphviz](https://pypi.org/project/graphviz/).#### Ubuntu/Debian```consolesudo apt-get install -y graphviz```#### macOS```consolebrew install graphviz```#### WindowsDownload and install the Graphviz installer from the [official website](https://graphviz.org/download/). Make sure to add the Graphviz bin directory to your system's PATH.### InstallationOnce Graphviz is installed, you can install `bigraph-viz` using pip:```consolepip install bigraph-viz```## TutorialTo get started with Bigraph-viz, explore the [Bigraph Schema Basics Tutorial](https://vivarium-collective.github.io/bigraph-viz/notebooks/basics.html).See the [Formatting Tutorial](https://vivarium-collective.github.io/bigraph-viz/notebooks/format.html) for examplesabout how to adjust the final look of your bigraph figure.See [Ecoli](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vivarium-collective/bigraph-viz/main/doc/_static/ecoli.png) for the wiringdiagraph of a whole-cell E. coli model.</longdescription>
