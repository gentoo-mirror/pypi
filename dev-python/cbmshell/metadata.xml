	<longdescription># cbmshellThis Python module provides an interactive shell to read and write files to disk image files (.d64, .d71, .d80, .d81, .d82) and tape image files (.t64, .tap) used by various Commodore microcomputer emulators and tools.It permits moving files between images and the local file system as well as other actions such as directory listing and file deletion.It provides many common benefits of a traditional UNIX shell including filename completion, command history and output redirection.## Quickstart GuideThe shell is started by running the `cbm-shell` command, this presents the prompt```(cbm)```The list of available commands is shown by the `help` command```(cbm) helpDocumented commands (use 'help -v' for verbose/'help &lt;topic&gt;' for details):===========================================================================alias   detach     from_petscii  lock   rename        shell       unlistattach  directory  help          macro  renumber      shortcuts   unlockcat     edit       history       merge  run_pyscript  text        untextcopy    file       images        mkdir  run_script    to_petsciidelete  format     list          quit   set           token_set```Detailed information for a command is shown using `help &lt;command&gt;`.Images need to be attached to a drive number in order to be used.```(cbm) attach mydisk.d64Attached mydisk.d64 to 0```Up to ten images can be attached at any one time.Files in an image can be addressed by prefixing the drive number followed by a colon. For example, to list a BASIC program in the image```(cbm) list 0:PRINT5 INPUT&quot;UPPER OR LOWER&quot;;C$:SA=0:IFC$=&quot;L&quot;THENSA=710 INPUT&quot;FILENAME&quot;;F$11 OPEN4,4,SA15 OPEN2,8,2,F$+&quot;,S,R&quot;20 GET#2,A$:IFST&lt;&gt;0THENPRINT#4:CLOSE4:CLOSE2:END21 IFA$=&quot;Ï€&quot;THENA$=&quot;,&quot;30 PRINT#4,A$;:GOTO20```Full documentation on [Read the Docs](https://cbmshell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).## TODO* more commands* better error handling</longdescription>
