This is a simple, to-the-point, library to make your pytorch training easy._This library is in early-stage currently! So, there might be breaking changes._### Idea around tez is simple:- keep things as simple as possible- make it as customizable as possible- clean code- faster prototyping- production readyCurrently, tez supports cpu, single gpu and multi-gpu &amp; tpu training. More coming soon!Using tez is super-easy. We don't want you to be far away from pytorch. So, you do everything on your own and just use tez to make a few things simpler.</longdescription>
