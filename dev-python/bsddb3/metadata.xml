	<longdescription>This module provides a nearly complete wrapping of the Oracle/Sleepycat C APIfor the Database Environment, Database, Cursor, Log Cursor, Sequence andTransaction objects, and each of these is exposed as a Python type in thebsddb3.db module. The database objects can use various access methods: btree,hash, recno, and queue.  Complete support of Berkeley DB distributedtransactions. Complete support for Berkeley DB Replication Manager. Completesupport for Berkeley DB Base Replication. Support for RPC.Please see the documents in the docs directory of the source distribution or atthe website for more details on the types and methods provided. The goal is tomirror most of the real Berkeley DB API so fall back to the Oracle Berkeley DBdocumentation as appropriate.If you need to support ancient versions of Python and/or Berkeley DB , you canuse old releases of this bindings.`Homepage &lt;https://www.jcea.es/programacion/pybsddb.htm&gt;`__ --`Releases (changelog) &lt;https://www.jcea.es/programacion/pybsddb.htm#Releases&gt;`__ --`Documentation &lt;https://www.jcea.es/programacion/pybsddb_doc/&gt;`__ --`Mailing List &lt;https://mailman.jcea.es/listinfo/pybsddb&gt;`__ --`Donation &lt;https://www.jcea.es/programacion/pybsddb_doc/donate.html&gt;`__.. warning::   This library is deprecated. If you are running Python 3 &gt;= 3.6, please   upgrade to `berkeleydb &lt;https://pypi.org/project/berkeleydb/&gt;`_ library.   Check `details &lt;https://www.jcea.es/programacion/pybsddb.htm&gt;`__.   Take note that upgrading to `berkeleydb`_ is easy but not transparent.   Notably, keys and values are **bytes** in `berkeleydb`_ lib, while in   'bsddb3' they are **strings**. You would only need to change your code to   add or remove type encoding/decoding, depending of how you use the library.   The process should be simple, nevertheless.</longdescription>
