	<longdescription>gidgethub=========An asynchronous `GitHub API &lt;https://docs.github.com/&gt;`_ library.Development status------------------.. image:: https://github.com/brettcannon/gidgethub/workflows/CI/badge.svg?event=push    :target: https://github.com/brettcannon/gidgethub/actions.. image:: https://codecov.io/gh/brettcannon/gidgethub/branch/master/graph/badge.svg    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/brettcannon/gidgethub.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/gidgethub/badge/?version=latest    :target: http://gidgethub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/    :alt: Documentation StatusInstallation------------Gidgethub is `available on PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/gidgethub/&gt;`_.::  python3 -m pip install gidgethubGidgethub requires Python version 3.7 and up.Goals-----The key goal is to provide a base library for the`GitHub API &lt;https://docs.github.com/&gt;`_ which performs no I/O of its own (a`sans-I/O &lt;https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_ library). This allows users tochoose whatever HTTP library they prefer while parceling out GitHub-specificdetails to this library. This base library is then built upon to provide anabstract base class to a cleaner API to work with. Finally, implementations ofthe abstract base class are provided for asynchronous HTTP libraries forimmediate usage.Alternative libraries---------------------If you think you want a different approach to the GitHub API,`GitHub maintains a list of libraries &lt;https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/overview/libraries&gt;`_.*Aside*: what's with the name?------------------------------I couldn't think of a good name that was somehow a play on &quot;GitHub&quot; or somehowtied into `Monty Python &lt;http://www.montypython.com/&gt;`_. And so I decided to playoff of GitHub's `octocat &lt;https://octodex.github.com/&gt;`_ mascot and use my owncat's name, Gidget, in some way. Since &quot;Gidget&quot; somewhat sounds like&quot;git&quot;, I decided to go with &quot;gidgethub&quot;.Changelog---------See the documentation for the `full changelog &lt;https://gidgethub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html&gt;`_.</longdescription>
