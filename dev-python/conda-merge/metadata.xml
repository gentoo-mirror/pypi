	<longdescription>conda-merge===========Tool for merging Conda (Anaconda) environment files into one file.This is used to merge your application environment file with any otherenvironment file you might need (e.g. unit-tests, debugging, jupyter notebooks)and create a consistent environment without breaking dependencies from theprevious environment files.**Installation**:::    pip install conda-merge**Usage**:::    conda-merge FILE1 FILE2 ... FILE-N &gt; OUTPUT-FILEA common problem with multiple environment files is that of pinned dependencies:let's say ``environment.yml`` contains the dependency ``numpy=1.7``, and your``dev-environment.yml`` contains ``pandas`` as a dependency. If you sequentiallyapply the environment files (``conda env update -f environment.yml`` and then``conda env update -f dev-environment.yml``) ``numpy`` will no longer be pinnedand will be upgraded to the latest version.One option to solve it is by using the pinned dependencies file in the environmentdirectory, but this means storing your dependencies in another file which interactswith ``environment.yml``, and makes the dependencies less clear to other users.This script enables you to merge the two environment files and then run onlyone ``conda env`` command to apply the change.</longdescription>
