	<longdescription>Velruse is a set of authentication routines that provide a unified wayto have a website user authenticate to a variety of different identityproviders and/or a variety of different authentication schemes.It is similar in some ways to RPXnow with the exception of beingopen-source, locally installable, and easily pluggable for customidentity providers and authentication schemes.You can run Velruse as a stand-alone service for use with your websitesregardless of the language they're written in. While Velruse itself iswritten in Python, since it can interact with your website purely viaHTTP POST's.Velruse can:* Normalize identity information from varying provider sources  (OpenID, Google, Facebook, etc.) to Portable Contacts.* Simplify complex authentication protocols by providing a simple  consistent API.* Provide extension points for other authentication systems, write your  own auth provider to handle CAS, LDAP, and use it with ease.* Integrate with most web applications regardless of the language used  to write the website.Warning: It's early yet for Velruse, so only those interested indeveloping Velruse should be taking a look into this now.----OverviewVelruse aims to simplify authenticating a user. It provides authproviders that handle authenticating to a variety of identity providerswith multiple authentication schemes (LDAP, SAML, etc.).Eventually, Velruse will include widgets similar to RPXNow that allowone to customize a login/registration widget so that a website user canselect a preferred identity provider to use to sign-in.In the mean-time, effort is focused on increasing the available authproviders for the commonly used authentication schemes and identityproviders (Facebook, Google, OpenID, etc).Unlike other authentication libraries for use with web applications, awebsite using Velruse for authentication does not have to be written inany particular language.APIVelruse implements an API similar to RPXNow to standardize the way aweb application handles user authentication.Velruse Authentication flow1. Website sends a POST to the auth provider‘s URL with an endpoint that   the user should be redirected back to when authentication is complete   and includes any additional parameters that the auth provider requires.2. When the auth provider finishes the authentication, the user is   redirected back to the endpoint specified with a POST, which includes   a unique token.3. Website then makes a query to the UserStore using the token that was   provided. The user’s identity information will be returned, or an   error if the authentication was unsuccessful.If the website is unable to directly access the UserStore then Step 3 canbe replaced by issuing a HTTP POST in the background to the auth providerrequesting the user’s information with the token.</longdescription>
