	<longdescription>XUnitMerge==========Utility for merging multiple XUnit xml reports into a single xml report.The primary purpose of this package is to be able to merge XUnit reportsgenerated by nosetests (e.g. ``nosetests --with-xunit``). This is especiallyuseful when nosetests needs to be run multiple times for different parts ofa project and then all reports need to be merged to a single report(similar to what coverage combine does with multiple coverage reports).Installing----------You can install ``xunitmerge`` using pip::    $ pip install xunitmergeOr alternatively you can install the`development &lt;http://github.com/miki725/xunitmerge/archive/master.tar.gz#egg=xunitmerge-dev&gt;`_version::    $ pip install xunitmerge==devUsing-----To use the plugin, use an executable ``xunitmerge`` which should becomeavailable after the installation..To see it's usage dialog, you can run it with a ``--help`` flag::    xunitmerge --helpIn summary, you can provide any number of paths of reports to be merged andan output report path::    xunitmerge report1.xml report2.xml report3.xml merged.xmlYou can also use it directly in Python::    from xunitmerge import merge_xunit    merge_xunit(files['report1.xml', 'report2.xml'], output='merged.xml)Running tests-------------You can run tests for this package by using nose::    $ nosetests --with-doctestCredits-------Miroslav Shubernetskiy - `GitHub &lt;https://github.com/miki725&gt;`_License-------This package is licensed under `MIT &lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT&gt;`_.::    The MIT License (MIT)    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy    of this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
