	<longdescription># histliteSee documentation on [ReadTheDocs](https://histlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).**histlite** is a histogram calculation and plotting library that tries to be&quot;lite&quot; on data structures but rich in statistics and visualization features.So far, development has taken place during my (Mike Richman) time as a graduatestudent and post-doctoral researcher in the field of particle astrophysics â€”specifically, working with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.  Histlite isintended both to facilitate high-paced exploratory data analysis as well as toserve as a building block for potentially very complex maximum likelihood dataanalysis implementations.The core design considerations are:* It must be trivial to work with and interchange between 1D, 2D, or ND histograms.* It should be as simple as possible to perform bin-wise arithmetic  operations on one or more histograms; to perform sums, integrals, etc. and  thus normalizations along one or more axes simultaneously; and to perform  spline or user-defined functional fits* It should be as simple as possible to achieve publication-quality plots.The primary histogramming functionality consists of a thin wrapper around`numpy.histogramdd`.  Statistical tools leverage **scipy** but includecustom solutions for some use cases.  (Importantly, error propagation iscurrently handled manually but may be migrated to the **uncertainties**package in the future.)  Plotting is done using **matplotlib**.</longdescription>
