	<longdescription># QCS SDK Python⚠️ In Development`qcs-sdk-python` provides an interface to Rigetti [Quantum Cloud Services](https://docs.rigetti.com/qcs/) (QCS), allowing usersto compile and run Quil programs on Rigetti quantum processors. Internally, it is powered by the [QCS Rust SDK](https://github.com/rigetti/qcs-sdk-rust).While this package can be used directly, [pyQuil](https://pypi.org/project/pyquil/) offers more functionality and a higher-level interface for building and executing Quil programs. This package is still in early development and breaking changes should be expected between minor versions.</longdescription>
