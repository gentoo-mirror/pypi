	<longdescription># design-of-experimentsA Python Package for Design of Experiments# MotivationI worked with a research team investigating how Design of Experiments could be applied to Synthetic Biology over the summer of 2020, as part of this I made a general software review and was a little dissapointed at the sparsity of python packages for designing experiments, and what packages were available I found to be considerably inferior to the comercial DOE software like JMP, MODDE, or Minitab. So, I have created this python package to offer an open-source package for the Design of Experiments!# Example```python&gt;&gt;&gt;import design&gt;&gt;&gt;Factors = {'Height':[1.6,2],'Width':[0.2,0.4],'Depth':[0.2,0.3],'Temp':[10,20],'Pressure':[100,200]}&gt;&gt;&gt;design.Factorial.frac_fact_2level(Factors,10)   Height  Width  Depth  Temp  Pressure0     1.6    0.2    0.2    20       2001     1.6    0.2    0.3    20       1002     1.6    0.4    0.2    10       2003     1.6    0.4    0.3    10       1004     2.0    0.2    0.2    10       1005     2.0    0.2    0.3    10       2006     2.0    0.4    0.2    20       1007     2.0    0.4    0.3    20       200```# Installation```pip install designofexperiment```#</longdescription>
