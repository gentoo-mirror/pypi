The library makesa best effort to extract relevant fields into type properties where it understands more about the mime typeof the document (as returned by Tika). This includes information like created/modified information as time zoneaware `datetime` objects. The full JSON response is always available to the user under the `.data`attribute.When a particular key is not present in the response, all properties will return `None` instead.## WhyOnly one other library for interfacing with Tika exists that I know of. I find it too complicated, trying to handlea lot of differing uses.The biggest issue I have with the library is its downloading and running of a jar file if needed. To me, anAPI client should only interface to the API and not try to provide functionality to startthe API as well. The user is responsible for providing the server with the Tika version they desire.The library also provides a lot of knobs to turn, but I argue most developers will not want to configure XML asthe response type, they just want the data, already parsed to the maximum extend possible.This library attempts to provide a simpler interface, minimal lines of code and typing of the parsed response.## License`tika-client` is distributed under the terms of the [GPL-3.0-only](https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-only.html) license.</longdescription>
