	<longdescription># Joulescope UIWelcome to Joulescope™!  Joulescope is an affordable, precision DC energyanalyzer that enables you to build better products.Joulescope™ accurately and simultaneously measures the voltage and currentsupplied to your target device, and it then computes power and energy.For more information on Joulescope, see[www.joulescope.com](https://www.joulescope.com).This repository contains the Joulescope graphical user interface (UI).The UI runs on a host computer and communicates with the Joulescope deviceover USB.  The application source code is available athttps://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui.  For the list of changes by release, see the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).The Joulescope UI is under active development, and many features remainoutstanding. See the [future features document](docs/features_future.md) for details.## Quick start using official distributionWe provide an official distribution that is prebuit for Windows, macOS andUbuntu 20.04LTS.[Download](https://www.joulescope.com/download) the application distributionfor your platform and install it.  ## Run as python packageThe Joulescope UI is a python package which you can install for pypi orrun directly from source.### Install PythonThe Joulescope User Interface requires Python 3.9 or newer.We recommend Python 3.10.Install [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/) on your system and then verifyyour python version at the terminal or command line:    &gt; python3 -VV    Python 3.10.10 (tags/v3.10.10:aad5f6a, Feb  7 2023, 17:20:36) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)]Ensure that you have Python 3.9 or newer and 64-bit.### Configure virtualenv [optional]Although not required, using[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)avoids dependency conflicts, especially if you use your python installation forother programs.  Using virtualenv ensures thatthe Joulescope software has the right dependencies without changing the restof your system.#### For Windows:Install virtualenv and create a new virtual environment:    python3 -v venv c:\venv\joulescopeActivate the virtual environment whenever you start a new terminal:    c:\venv\joulescope\Scripts\activate#### For POSIX including (Linux, Mac OS X with homebrew):Install virtualenv and create a new virtual environment:    python3 -m venv ~/venv/joulescopeActivate the virtual environment whenever you start a new terminal:    . ~/venv/joulescope/bin/activate### Option 1: Install from pypiInstallation from pypi is easy:    pip3 install -U joulescope_ui    If you just want to run the latest released version of the UI, use this option!### Option 2: Clone, install and run from sourceClone and configure the Joulescope UI from the terminal or command line:    git clone https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui.git    cd pyjoulescope_ui    pip3 install -U -r requirements.txtMake any optional modifications you want to the source code.  Then build andinstall the source:    python3 setup.py sdist    pip3 install dist/joulescope_ui-{version}.tar.gzYou can then run from any directory:    python3 -m joulescope_uiIf you see an error importing win32api on Windows, you should try running thiscommand from an Administrator command prompt:   python {path_to_python}\scripts\pywin32_postinstall.py -install### Option 3: Develop the UIClone and configure the Joulescope UI from the terminal or command line:    git clone https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui.git    cd pyjoulescope_ui    pip3 install -U -r requirements.txtBuild the QT resources:    python3 setup.py qtAs long as the current directory is the source directory, you can run:    python3 -m joulescope_uiIf you want to run from another directory, you will need to add the sourceto your PYTHONPATH environment variable.  On Windows:    set PYTHONPATH={C:\path\to\repos}\pyjoulescope_uiand on POSIX (Linux, Mac OS X with homebrew):    export PYTHONPATH={path/to/repos}/pyjoulescope_uiTo also distribute the UI on macOS, you need to install XCode and thenconfigure node:    brew install node    npm installYou will also need to install the signing certificate usingApplications/Utilities/Keychain Access.### Option 4: Develop both UI and driverIf you also want to simultaneously develop the Joulescope UI and theJoulescope driver:    pip3 uninstall joulescope    cd {path/to/repos}    git clone https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope.git    cd pyjoulescope    pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt        python3 setup.py build_ext --inplaceYou should then modify your python path to find both the UI and driversource paths. On Windows:    set PYTHONPATH={C:\path\to\repos}\pyjoulescope;{C:\path\to\repos}\pyjoulescope_uiand on POSIX (Linux, Mac OS X with homebrew):    export PYTHONPATH={path/to/repos}/pyjoulescope:{path/to/repos}/pyjoulescope_uiFollow the instructions from Option 3 to configure and run the UI.## LicenseAll pyjoulescope_ui code is released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license.See the [License File](LICENSE.txt) for details.</longdescription>
