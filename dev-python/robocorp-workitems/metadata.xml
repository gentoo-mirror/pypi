	<longdescription># robocorp-workitemsWork items are used in Robocorp Control Room for managing data that go throughmultiple steps and tasks inside a process. Each step of a process receives inputwork items from the previous step, and creates output work items for the nextstep.## Getting startedThe library exposes two objects, `inputs` and `outputs`, which are the main wayto interact with work item queues. The former deals with the reading input workitems, and the latter with creating output work items.A run inside Control Room will always have at least one work item available toit. The simplest Robot which reads the current work item and creates an outputcan be done in the following manner:```pythonfrom robocorp import workitemsfrom robocorp.tasks import task@taskdef handle_item():    item = workitems.inputs.current    print(&quot;Received payload:&quot;, item.payload)    workitems.outputs.create(payload={&quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot;})```Iterating over all available input items in the queue is also easy:```pythonfrom robocorp import workitemsfrom robocorp.tasks import task@taskdef handle_all_items():    for item in workitems.inputs:        print(&quot;Received payload:&quot;, item.payload)        workitems.outputs.create(payload={&quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot;})```### Work item structureA work item's data payload is JSON and allows storing anything that is JSONserializable. By default the payload is a mapping of key-value pairs.In addition to the payload section, a work item can also contain files, whichare stored within Robocorp Control Room. Adding and using files with work itemsrequires no additional setup from the user.## Guides- [Reserving and releasing input items](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/blob/master/workitems/docs/guides/reserving-inputs.md)- [Creating outputs](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/blob/master/workitems/docs/guides/creating-outputs.md)- [Email triggering](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/blob/master/workitems/docs/guides/email-triggering.md)- [Advanced patterns](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/blob/master/workitems/docs/guides/advanced-patterns.md)- [Local development](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/blob/master/workitems/docs/guides/local-development.md)Further user guides and tutorials can be found in [Robocorp Docs](https://robocorp.com/docs).## API ReferenceInformation on specific functions or classes: [robocorp.workitems](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/blob/master/workitems/docs/api/robocorp.workitems.md)## ChangelogA list of releases and corresponding changes can be found in the [changelog](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/blob/master/workitems/docs/CHANGELOG.md).</longdescription>
