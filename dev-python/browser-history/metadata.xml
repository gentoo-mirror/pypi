See [this](https://browser-history.readthedocs.io/en/latest/browsers.html) for a full list. - Supports all major platforms - **Windows, Mac and Linux**. - A **command-line tool**: simply run `browser-history --help` from your terminal. - **History**: browsing history with exact timestamp and URL. - **Bookmarks**: browser bookmarks with timestamp, URL, title and folder. - Lightweight: the entire package is less than 20kB in size and has no dependencies other than python 3.7+. - Developer friendly: you can add support for new browsers or add a new feature very easily. - Default browser: can automatically determine the default browser on Windows and Linux (`browser-history -b default`). - Fully open source: this project is developed and maintained by the [`browser-history` organization](https://github.com/browser-history) (previously maintained by [PESOS](https://github.com/pesos)) and will always be open source (with the Apache 2.0 License).# Quick Start## InstallationTo install the latest release:```pip install browser-history```To install from the master branch (warning: development version. Things could break)```pip install git+https://github.com/browser-history/browser-history.git```## Usage### HistoryTo get history from all installed browsers:```pythonfrom browser_history import get_historyoutputs = get_history()# his is a list of (datetime.datetime, url) tupleshis = outputs.histories```If you want history from a specific browser:```pythonfrom browser_history.browsers import Firefoxf = Firefox()outputs = f.fetch_history()# his is a list of (datetime.datetime, url) tupleshis = outputs.histories``` - `Firefox` in the above snippet can be replaced with any of the [supported browsers](https://browser-history.readthedocs.io/en/latest/browsers.html).### BookmarksWARNING: Experimental feature. Although this has been confirmed to work on multiple (Firefox and Chromium based) browserson all platforms, it is not covered by tests and has not been used as much as the history feature.To get bookmarks from all installed browsers:```pythonfrom browser_history import get_bookmarksoutputs = get_bookmarks()# bms is a list of (datetime.datetime, url, title, folder) tuplesbms = outputs.bookmarks```To get bookmarks from a specific browser:```pythonfrom browser_history.browsers import Firefoxf = Firefox()outputs = f.fetch_bookmarks()# bms is a list of (datetime.datetime, url, title, folder) tuplesbms = outputs.bookmarks```Check out the [documentation](https://browser-history.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details.# Supported BrowsersRead the [documentation](https://browser-history.readthedocs.io/en/latest/browsers.html)# CreditsLogo designed with :heart: by [XA](https://github.com/XAMES3).# LicenseLicensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;)](LICENSE)</longdescription>
