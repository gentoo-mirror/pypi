	<longdescription>## ampyMicroPython Tool (ampy) - Utility to interact with a CircuitPython or MicroPython board over a serial connection.Ampy is meant to be a simple command line tool to manipulate files and run code on a CircuitPython orMicroPython board over its serial connection.With ampy you can send files from your computer to theboard's file system, download files from a board to your computer, and even send a Python scriptto a board to be executed.Note that ampy by design is meant to be simple and does not support advanced interaction like a shellor terminal to send input to a board.  Check out other MicroPython toolslike [rshell](https://github.com/dhylands/rshell)or [mpfshell](https://github.com/wendlers/mpfshell) for more advanced interaction with boards.## InstallationYou can use ampy with either Python 2.7.x or 3.x and can install it easily fromPython's package index.  On MacOS or Linux, in a terminal run the following command (assumingPython 3):    pip3 install --user adafruit-ampyOn Windows, do:    pip install adafruit-ampyNote on some Linux and Mac OSX systems you might need to run as root with sudo:    sudo pip3 install adafruit-ampyIf you don't have Python 3 then try using Python 2 with:    pip install adafruit-ampyOnce installed verify you can run the ampy program and get help output:    ampy --helpYou should see usage information displayed like below:    Usage: ampy [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...      ampy - Adafruit MicroPython Tool      Ampy is a tool to control MicroPython boards over a serial connection.      Using ampy you can manipulate files on the board's internal filesystem and      even run scripts.    Options:      -p, --port PORT  Name of serial port for connected board.  [required]      -b, --baud BAUD  Baud rate for the serial connection. (default 115200)      -d, --delay DELAY Delay in seconds before entering RAW MODE (default 0)      --help           Show this message and exit.    Commands:      get  Retrieve a file from the board.      ls   List contents of a directory on the board.      put  Put a file on the board.      rm   Remove a file from the board.      run  Run a script and print its output.If you'd like to install from the Github source then use the standard Pythonsetup.py install (or develop mode):    python3 setup.py installNote to run the unit tests on Python 2 you must install the mock library:    pip install mock## UsageAmpy is made to talk to a CircuitPython MicroPython board over its serial connection.  You willneed your board connected and any drivers to access it serial port installed.Then for example to list the files on the board run a command like:    ampy --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART lsYou should see a list of files on the board's root directory printed to theterminal.  Note that you'll need to change the port parameter to the name or pathto the serial port that the MicroPython board is connected to.Other commands are available, run ampy with --help to see more information:    ampy --helpEach subcommand has its own help, for example to see help for the ls command  run (note youunfortunately must have a board connected and serial port specified):    ampy --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART ls --help## ConfigurationFor convenience you can set an `AMPY_PORT` environment variable which will be usedif the port parameter is not specified.  For example on Linux or OSX:    export AMPY_PORT=/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART    ampy lsOr on Windows (untested) try the SET command:    set AMPY_PORT=COM4    ampy lsSimilarly, you can set `AMPY_BAUD` and `AMPY_DELAY` to control your baud rate andthe delay before entering RAW MODE.To set these variables automatically each time you run `ampy`, copy them into afile named `.ampy`:```sh# Example .ampy file# Please fill in your own port, baud rate, and delayAMPY_PORT=/dev/cu.wchusbserial1410AMPY_BAUD=115200# Fix for macOS users' &quot;Could not enter raw repl&quot;; try 2.0 and lower from there:AMPY_DELAY=0.5```You can put the `.ampy` file in your working directory, one of its parents, or inyour home directory.</longdescription>
