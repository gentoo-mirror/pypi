Please see the work-in-progress `Release Plan`_ and contribute your ideas for v2.x enhancements by eitheropening enhancement issues_ or by joining our`webexteamssdk - Webex Teams SDK - Python Community Contributors &lt;https://eurl.io/#BJ0A8gfOQ&gt;`_ space and posting yourideas there.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**webexteamssdk** is a *community developed* Python library for working with the Webex Teams APIs.  Our goal is to makeworking with Webex Teams in Python a *native* and *natural* experience!.. code-block:: Python    from webexteamssdk import WebexTeamsAPI    api = WebexTeamsAPI()    # Find all rooms that have 'webexteamssdk Demo' in their title    all_rooms = api.rooms.list()    demo_rooms = [room for room in all_rooms if 'webexteamssdk Demo' in room.title]    # Delete all of the demo rooms    for room in demo_rooms:        api.rooms.delete(room.id)    # Create a new demo room    demo_room = api.rooms.create('webexteamssdk Demo')    # Add people to the new demo room    email_addresses = [&quot;test01@cmlccie.com&quot;, &quot;test02@cmlccie.com&quot;]    for email in email_addresses:        api.memberships.create(demo_room.id, personEmail=email)    # Post a message to the new room, and upload a file    api.messages.create(demo_room.id, text=&quot;Welcome to the room!&quot;,                        files=[&quot;https://www.webex.com/content/dam/wbx/us/images/dg-integ/teams_icon.png&quot;])That's more than 6 Webex Teams API calls in less than 23 lines of code (with comments and whitespace), and likely morethan that, since webexteamssdk handles pagination_ for you automatically!webexteamssdk makes your life better...  `Learn how!`____ Introduction_Features--------webexteamssdk does all of this for you:* Transparently sources your Webex Teams access token from your local environment* Provides and uses default arguments and settings everywhere possible, so you don't have to think about things like API  endpoint URLs, HTTP headers and JSON formats* Represents all Webex Teams API interactions using native Python tools  * Authentication and Connection to the Webex Teams Cloud ==&gt; **WebexTeamsAPI** &quot;connection object&quot;  * API Calls ==&gt; Hierarchically organized methods underneath the **WebexTeamsAPI** 'Connection Object'  * Returned Data Objects ==&gt; Native Python objects* **Automatic and transparent pagination!*** **Automatic rate-limit handling!** *(wait|retry)** Multipart encoding and uploading of local files* Auto-completion in your favorite IDE, descriptive exceptions, and so much more...Installation------------Installing and upgrading webexteamssdk is easy:**Install via PIP**.. code-block:: bash    $ pip install webexteamssdk**Upgrade to the latest version**.. code-block:: bash    $ pip install webexteamssdk --upgradeDocumentation-------------**Excellent documentation is now available at:**http://webexteamssdk.readthedocs.ioCheck out the Quickstart_ to dive in and begin using webexteamssdk.Examples--------Are you looking for some sample scripts?

Feedback, thoughts, ideas, and code contributions are welcome!Please see the `Contributing`_ guide for more information.History-------The Webex Teams SDK (webexteamssdk) library started as Cisco Spark API (ciscosparkapi). We updated the library's name inalignment with Cisco's re-brand of Cisco Spark to Webex Teams. The Cisco Spark API library has been deprecated and is nolonger supported; however, its open-source codebase is still available in the `ciscosparkapi`_ branch of thisrepository.The development team may make additional name changes as the library evolves with the Webex APIs published ondeveloper.webex.com.*Copyright (c) 2016-2020 Cisco and/or its affiliates.*.. _Release Plan: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/webexteamssdk/wiki/Release-Plans.. _Introduction: http://webexteamssdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/intro.html.. _pagination: https://developer.webex.com/pagination.html.. _webexteamssdk.readthedocs.io: https://webexteamssdk.readthedocs.io.. _Quickstart: http://webexteamssdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart.html.. _examples: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/webexteamssdk/tree/master/examples.. _webexteamssdk: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/webexteamssdk.. _issues: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/webexteamssdk/issues.. _Community: https://eurl.io/#HkMxO-_9-.. _projects: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/webexteamssdk/projects.. _pull requests: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/webexteamssdk/pulls.. _releases: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/webexteamssdk/releases.. _the repository: webexteamssdk_.. _pull request: `pull requests`_.. _Contributing: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/webexteamssdk/blob/master/docs/contributing.rst.. _ciscosparkapi: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ciscosparkapi/tree/ciscosparkapi</longdescription>
