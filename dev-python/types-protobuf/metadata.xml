	<longdescription>## Typing stubs for protobufThis is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)type stub package for the [`protobuf`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) package.It can be used by type-checking tools like[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses`protobuf`.This version of `types-protobuf` aims to provide accurate annotationsfor `protobuf==4.24.*`.The source for this package can be found athttps://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/protobuf. All fixes fortypes and metadata should be contributed there.Generated using [mypy-protobuf==3.5.0](https://github.com/nipunn1313/mypy-protobuf/tree/v3.5.0) on protobuf==4.21.8This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.This package was generated from typeshed commit `e477c67852834a5bb8c22dec498d580a6421a3ea` and was testedwith mypy 1.6.1, pyright 1.1.332, andpytype 2023.10.17.</longdescription>
