	<longdescription>translationstring=================A library used by various `Pylons Project &lt;https://pylonsproject.org&gt;`_ packagesfor internationalization (i18n) duties related to translation.This package provides a *translation string* class, a *translation stringfactory* class, translation and pluralization primitives, and a utility thathelps `Chameleon &lt;https://chameleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_ templates usetranslation facilities of this package.  It does not depend on `Babel&lt;http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/&gt;`_, but its translation and pluralizationservices are meant to work best when provided with an instance of the``babel.support.Translations`` class.Please see https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/translationstring/en/latest/for the documentation.translationstring=================1.4 (2020-07-09)----------------- Drop support for Python 2.6, 3.2 and 3.- Update license classifiers1.3 (2014-11-05)----------------- Fix Python 3-specific test failures.- Restore compatibility with Python 3.2.1.2 (2014-11-04)----------------- Add support for message contexts.- If the object passed to a TranslationStringFactory ``__call__`` method is  itself a translation string, use the passed object's ``domain`` instead of  the domain passed to the factory's contstructor.  See  https://github.com/Pylons/translationstring/pull/12 .1.1 (2012-02-08)----------------- Add MANIFEST to make sure all files are present in a release. This fixes  `ticket 8 &lt;https://github.com/Pylons/translationstring/issues/8&gt;`_.1.0 (2012-02-04)----------------- coerce non-string values to a string during translation, except for None.- Honour mapping information passed to the translator, combining it with  mapping data already part of the translation string.- Support formatting of translation strings with %-operator.0.4 (09-22-2011)----------------- Python 3 compatibility (thanks to Joe Dallago, GSOC student).- Remove testing dependency on Babel.- Moved to GitHub (https://github.com/Pylons/translationstring).- Added tox.ini for testing purposes.0.3 (06-25-2010)----------------- Preserve default translations even if they are an empty string. This  fixes problems with Chameleon being unable to determine if a translation  is present or not.0.2 (04-25-2010)----------------- Add ``__getstate__`` and ``__reduce__`` methods to translation  string to allow for pickling.- Fix bug in ChameleonTranslate.  When ``i18n:translate`` was used in  templates, a translation string was inappropriately created with a  ``default`` value of the empty string.  Symptom: template text would  &quot;disappear&quot; rather than being returned untranslated.0.1 (04-24-2010)----------------- Initial release.</longdescription>
