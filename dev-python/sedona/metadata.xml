You can use it with a video or playlist URL or you can create a text file with as many URLs as you want and have Sedona process it.In case you're wondering, Sedona also works with __YouTube Music__. Our tool is the best YouTube to MP3 Converter. You get free and unlimited downloads with high quality audio. Not only you can use it as much as you want, but you can also use it wherever you want: Sedona is cross-plataform and supports Windows, Mac and Linux!It's been made with Python 3.8 and tested on Linux and Windows 10.## UsageIn order to download a YouTube video with Sedona, go to your command line and execute:```bashsedona [video_url]```If you want to download a playlist, you can also do as explained above:```bashsedona [playlist_url]```If you wish to download multiple videos and playlists, you can create a text file like this one:```https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MktSE45zlrIhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyXmsVwZqX4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nQNiWdeH2Q```Now, all you have to do is:```bashsedona [file_path]```In case you need it, there's a help option available:```bashsedona --help```Moreover, you can check the program version with:```bashsedona --version```## DemosIt's important to note that the URL contains special characters and the shell may misinterpret it.Having said that, you should use quotation marks to prevent bad processing of the URLs.In order to download a video, you should run:```bashsedona &quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MktSE45zlrI&quot;```For Bash and PowerShell, the above choice is a good one. However, if you use ZSH, you may not need to use quotation marks, because it's smart and will automatically use 'escapes'. You paste the URL into ZSH and you will have it like this:```sedona https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=MktSE45zlrI```### Video downloadI use ZSH, so I won't put quotation marks.Since the URLs have 'escapes' already, you must run without quotation marks as well.Let's execute:```sedona https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=MktSE45zlrI```&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;    &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/giovcandido/sedona/blob/master/demos/video_download.gif?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Sedona downloading a video&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;### Playlist downloadNow, let's download a playlist:```sedona https://www.youtube.com/playlist\?list\=PLGtghrm-sc-KI9pS5w6jipUCxjdUSuv1K```The mp3 files will be numbered according to the playlist ordering. Addionatilly, all files will be stored in a directory with the same name as the playlist. Actually, it's not always the same name, once we have to choose a safe name.&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;    &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/giovcandido/sedona/blob/master/demos/playlist_download.gif?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Sedona downloading a playlist&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;### Text file downloadLet's use a text file to download some videos.Create a text file 'urls.txt' as the one presented in the usage section.Note that the text file should have one URL per line and there's no need to use quotation marks.If you created the file in your currrent directory, execute:```sedona urls.txt```&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;    &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/giovcandido/sedona/blob/master/demos/text_download.gif?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Sedona downloading from a text file&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;### Output directoryThe default output directory of Sedona is SedonaMP3, which is created automatically in your user directory. If you're on Linux, that's your home directory.&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;    &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/giovcandido/sedona/blob/master/demos/show_output.gif?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Showing output directory&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;## RequirementsCheck requirements.txt to see a complete list of dependencies. But, don't worry about them. They are automatically installed for you.However, ffmpeg is required for the MP3 conversion, you need to install it on your OS. If you're on Linux, you may not need to install it or you can do so through your package manager. If you're using a Debian-based distro, you can run:```bashsudo apt install ffmpeg ```If you're using a Fedora-based distro, you can run:```bashsudo dnf install ffmpeg ```If you're using an OpenSUSE-based distro, you can run:```bashsudo zypper install opisudo opi codecs ```If you're using an Arch-based distro, you can run:```bashsudo pacman -S ffmpeg```Additionally, if you're using any another Linux OS, you can download the tar file [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and install it manually.If you are a MacOS (or even a Linux) user, you can use [Homebrew](brew.sh) to install ffmpeg. Simply execute:```bashbrew install ffmpeg```In case you are a Windows user, you can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) to install it by running the command:```bashchoco install ffmpeg```Remember to open CMD or PowerShell as an administrator, or you can use [gsudo](https://github.com/gerardog/gsudo) as I do.You can also install it manually on MacOS or Windows. For Windows, [download](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) it and follow a [guide](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows).## InstallationThere is more than one way to install Sedona. You can install it from source, you can get it using pip or you can download the official rpm/deb.If you want to get it from source, download the latest release on GitHub. Then, extract the source code and run:```bashpython3 setup.py install```If you want to install Sedona with pip, you just need to run:```bashpip3 install sedona```You can also run:```bashsudo pip3 install sedona```Additionally, if you want to download our official rpm, check out the releases in our GitHub repository.Once you have the rpm, you can install it with your package manager.If you're using a Fedora-based distro, you can run:```bashsudo dnf install [path-to-rpm/file.rpm]```If you're using an OpenSUSE-based distro, you can run:```bashsudo zypper install [path-to-rpm/file.rpm]```You can also install it with:```bashsudo rpm -i [path-to-rpm/file.rpm]```On the other hand, the official deb package is also available in our releases.In order to install it, run:```bashsudo apt install [path-to-deb/file.deb]```You can also install it with:```bashsudo dpkg -i [path-to-deb/file.deb]```_Signing our rpm/deb packages with gpg is still a work in progress._## TroubleshootingInstalling Sedona via pip and then installing it via rpm may leave you with two different versions of it.This may lead to an error when executing Sedona, since there would be conflicting data.In this case, run:```bashlocate --all &quot;sedona&quot; ```Look for '-py3.8.egg-info' in the output. If there's more than one directory with this pattern, remove the one corresponding to the unwanted version.## ContributeFeel free to reach out and contribute. We can add more features to Sedona and maybe implement our own backend.You can also help me test it on MacOS.[pypi-badge]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sedona.svg[pypi-link]: https://pypi.org/project/sedona[install-badge]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/sedona?label=pypi%20installs[install-link]: https://pypistats.org/packages/sedona[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/sedona.svg[license-link]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sedona/[status-badge]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/status/sedona.svg[status-link]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sedona/</longdescription>
