	<longdescription># sts-libsLibs for testing storage drivers and userspace utilities on rpm-based operating systems.## What is this?The goal is to be able to rapidly write new tests with ease.It started as an incompatible fork of [libsan](https://gitlab.com/rh-kernel-stqe/python-libsan)and [stqe](https://gitlab.com/rh-kernel-stqe/python-libsan) with many changes. Most notably: - Python 3.8+ only. - Minimum dependencies. - With [tmt](https://github.com/teemtee/tmt)-compatibility in mind. - One repository for both libs and tests.## Who is this for?Fedora, CentOS, RHEL testers.## How do I contribute?See [contributing](https://gitlab.com/rh-kernel-stqe/sts/docs/contributing.md) doc.</longdescription>
