	<longdescription>======DistKV======Welcome to `DistKV &lt;https://github.com/smurfix/distkv&gt;`__!DistKV is a master-less distributed key-value storage system. Itcircumvents the CAP theorem by assuming that keys are usually only changedby one node. It is resistant to partitioning and intended to be always-on;it might delay – but will not lose – updates even in a partitioned network.DistKV comes with several batteries included:* Basic user management, pattern-based ACLs* Strong typing, code- and/or `JSON Schema`-based* Data mangling* Background code execution* Seamless recovery even if only one master is running* a MQTT 3.1 back-end that stores persistent data in DistKV,  based on hbmqttAPI===DistKV offers an efficient msgpack-based interface to access data and tochange internal settings. Most configuration is stored inside DistKVitself.Stored data are **not** forced to be strings or binary sequences, but canbe anything that `MsgPack` supports. Keys to storage are multi-level andsupport string, integer/float, and list keys.Non-Features============DistKV does not support data partitioning. Every node stores the wholedata set and can instantly deliver mostly-uptodate data.DistKV does not have a disk-based storage backend; periodic snapshots andevent logs can be used to quickly restore a system, if necessary.Status======DistKV is mostly stable. There are a lot of corner cases that don'thave tests yetTODOs:* some services (esp. command line tools and runners) are under-tested* there's no good API for errorsChangelog=========0.41: the message monitor can do multiple subpaths and only reports initial-load-complete once0.40: use asyncscope for running subsystems in a reasonable way0.35: allow forgetting nodes (if they have no data attached)0.30: major API refactoring: paths are now separate objectsTODO====* update the whole ecosystem to anyio 2.0 (asyncclick asyncscope …)* clean up some of the more egregious command line mistakes* create a page for showcase-ing subprojects (distinv knx owfs akumuli …)* improve Home Assistant integration</longdescription>
