The aim of the module is to reduce pulsebuilding to the logical minimum of specifications so that building andmanipulation become as easy as saying &quot;Gimme a square wave, then aramp, then a sine, and then wait for 10 ms&quot; and, in particular, &quot;Dothe same thing again, but now with the sine having twice the frequencyit had before&quot;.The little extra module called `ripasso` performs frequency filteringand frequency filter  compensation. It could be useful in a generalsetting and is therefore factored out to its own module.The name: The broad bean is one of my favourite pulses.### Formal requirementsThe broadbean package only works with python 3.7+### InstallationIn general, refer to [broadbeans documentation](https://qcodes.github.io/broadbean/start/index.html#installation)for installation instructions.</longdescription>
