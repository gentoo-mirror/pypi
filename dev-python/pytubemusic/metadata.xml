	<longdescription># PyTubeMusicA cli that may or may not download music from a certain website.## Install```pip install pytubemusic```**Requires [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed on your machine.**&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Installation Note&lt;/summary&gt;PyTubeMusic uses the [PyTube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) library. Thiscan occasionally break. However, patches are usually quickly released as newversions or as pull requests. Try upgrading to the latest version of PyTube ifdownloading fails.&gt; Note, to pip install from a pull request do:&gt; ```text&gt;  pip install git+https://github.com/pytube/pytube.git@refs/pull/&lt;PR_NUM&gt;/head&gt; ```&gt; Where `&lt;PR_NUM&gt;` is the number of the pull request.&lt;/details&gt;## UsagePyTubeMusic track data is specified in TOML formats. TOML files have thefollowing format:```tomltype = &quot;track | album&quot;cover = { url = &quot;URL&quot; }#cover = { file = &quot;Path&quot; }# For &quot;track&quot; type onlyurl = &quot;...&quot;  # URL to videostart = &quot;...&quot;  # start timestamp for track (optional - default 00:00)end = &quot;...&quot;  # end timestamp for track (optional - default end of video)[metadata]album = &quot;...&quot;  # Required for &quot;album&quot; typetitle = &quot;...&quot;  # required for &quot;track&quot; type# Other FFMPEG metadata tags (unchecked)# For album type only – array of track types[[tracks]]# Tracks data format specified below```### Album `tracks` blocksFor albums, several different track blocks can be specified. These are:- `track` - a single track from a video:  ```toml  [[tracks]]  type = &quot;track&quot;  url = &quot;...&quot;  # URL to video  start = &quot;...&quot;  # start timestamp (optional - default 00:00)  end = &quot;...&quot;  # end timestamp(optional - default end of video)    [tracks.metadata]  title = &quot;...&quot; # required for &quot;track&quot; type  # Other FFMPEG metadata tags (unchecked)  ```- `split` - several tracks from a single video:  ```toml  [[tracks]]  type = &quot;split&quot;  url = &quot;...&quot;  # URL to video  tracks = [    { start = &quot;...&quot;, end = &quot;...&quot;, metadata = { title = &quot;...&quot; } },  ]  ```  start and end timestamps in track list are optional - start defaults to 00:00  and end defaults to the start of the next track or the end of the video. The  metadata title is required – other ffmpeg metadata tags can be added which  will override album-wide metadata.- `merge` - combines multiple videos into one track  ```toml  [[tracks]]  type = &quot;merge&quot;  tracks = [    {url = &quot;...&quot;, start = &quot;...&quot;, end = &quot;...&quot;},  ]  [tracks.metadata]  title = &quot;...&quot; # required  # Other FFMPEG metadata tags (unchecked)  ```  start and end timestamps in track list are optional - start defaults to 00:00  and end defaults to the start of the next track or the end of the video.- `playlist` - downloads a playlist - as either several tracks or combined into  one.  ```toml  [[tracks]]  type = &quot;playlist&quot;  join = false  # whether to join videos into single track (optional, default false)  tracks = [    # include metadata only if join = false    {start = &quot;...&quot;, end = &quot;...&quot;, drop = false, metadata = {title = &quot;...&quot;}},  ]  # include only if join is true  [tracks.metadata]  title = &quot;...&quot;  ```  Metadata needs to be included on tracks only if join is false, and for the  overall track if join is true. The `drop` boolean on each track specifies  whether that video should be ignored from the playlist videos. start and end  timestamps are optional.### CLIA `pytubemusic` command will be added upon installation. The help for the CLIis:```textUsage: pytubemusic [OPTIONS] PATHArguments * path PATH Path to track/album toml file [required]Options --out -o PATH The directory files will be written to [default: .] --help Show this message and exit.```Tracks are written to the cwd unless `--out` is specified, albums are written toa directory with the album name within the `--out` directory.</longdescription>
