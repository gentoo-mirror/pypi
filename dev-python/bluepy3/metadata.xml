Visit the project's homepage to read the correctly formatted [README.md](https://github.com/Mausy5043/bluepy3#readme) file. ## RequirementsPlease be aware that this is not a beginners tool. Some experience with Linux CLI, Python3 and BT/BLE is expected.The package has been extensively tested on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (aarch64) with Debian GNU Linux 11 kernel 6.* and Python 3.9.*. It requires Python v3.7 or higher to be installed.The code needs an executable `bluepy3-helper` which is compiled from C source automatically if you use the recommended pip installation method (see below). Otherwise,you can rebuild it using the Makefile in the `bluepy3` directory.The `bluepy3` package comes installed with lists of compatible UUIDs in `uuids.json`. If, for whatever reason, you want to rebuild those lists, then the Python3 modules`bs4`, `requests` and `lxml` need to be installed.```(python3)python3 -m pip install bs4 lxml requests```Then find where the bluepy3 package is installed and rebuild `uuids.json` thus: ```(bash)cd some_path_name/site-packages/bluepy3/make uuids.json```## InstallationTo install the current released version, on most Debian-based systems:```(bash)sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev libbluetooth-devpython3 -m pip install --upgrade bluepy3```Then test the installation using:```(bash)sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+ep $(find . -name bluepy3-helper)blescan -nsudo hcitool lescan```This should list all (compatible) Bluetooth devices in range.It may be considered to have command-line tools from BlueZ available for debugging. Thereare instructions for building BlueZ on the Raspberry Pi at http://www.elinux.org/RPi_Bluetooth_LE.## TroubleshootingMake sure the user is part of the `bluetooth` group.   Use `hciconfig` to confirm that the device actually exists. This should output something like:```hci0:    Type: Primary  Bus: UARTBD Address: B8:27:EB:90:4F:F5  ACL MTU: 1021:8  SCO MTU: 64:1UP RUNNINGRX bytes:15332515 acl:452626 sco:0 events:333729 errors:0TX bytes:7376962 acl:438075 sco:0 commands:72113 errors:0```Use `hciconfig [hci0] up` to activate the BT device if the above returns an error.Although Python v3.7 will still work, official support for v3.7 is dropped as of JUN2023 since that is EOL. It is advised to upgrade your Python installation to v3.9 or above.## DocumentationDocumentation can be built from the sources in the `docs/` directory using Sphinx.## License  See [LICENSE](LICENSE)## AcknowledgementsThis work builds on previous work by [Ian Harvey](https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy) and uses code by the [BlueZ project](http://www.bluez.org/) (not a https site) and the more up-to-date [BlueZ on GitHub](https://github.com/bluez/bluez)Original source code and excellent documentation can be found at:     https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy     http://ianharvey.github.io/bluepy-doc/MIT LicenseCopyright (c) 2023 Maurice (mausy5043) HendrixPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
