These can be sent to the MiG (https://sourceforge.net/projects/migrid/), which is used for actual job processing and data storage.Currently this package does very little on its own.## Installationmig_meow can be installed from pypi using pip using:```pip install mig_meow```## Jupytermig_meow is designed primarily to be used within Jupyter notebooks, either as astandard notebook or within Jupyter Lab. If you are running it within Jupyter Lab it will require the labextensions:- jupyterlab-manager (https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets)- bqplot (https://github.com/bqplot/bqplot)## ExamplesSome example patterns and recipes are included in the 'examples' directory. These can be worked through in the 'workflow_examples.ipynb' notebook.## TestingAutomatic testing is available though it will require a numpy install to work correctly.</longdescription>
