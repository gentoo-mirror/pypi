	<longdescription>Inspektor=========Inspektor is a program used to verify the code of your python project. Itevolved from a set of scripts used to check patches and code of python projectsof the autotest organization [1]. As the project grew and new modules startedto be developed, we noticed the same scripts had to be copied to each newproject repo, creating a massive headache when we needed to update saidscripts.Inspektor knows how to:1) Check code with the help of `pylint`.2) Check indentation of your code with the help of `pycodestyle`,   correcting it if you so deem appropriate.3) Check whether your code is PEP8 compliant, correcting it if necessary   (only works if you have `autopep8` installed) if you so deem appropriate.4) If your project is hosted on the autotest github area, it can apply pull   requests made against it, and check if it introduced any regression from   the metrics outlined above.This all assumes you're working on a version control checkout of your code.Currently inspektor knows how to handle subversion and git.Installing inspektor--------------------You can get inspektor through pip:::    $ sudo pip install inspektorBut you should avoid doing that if possible. A virtual environment deploymenttends to be better, since each installation is restricted to each environment:::    $ virtualenv .venv    $ source .venv/bin/activate    $ pip install inspektorIf you are developing inspektor, you can install it in your virtual environmentas an editable package. From this source code tree root:::    $ pip install -e .Usage-----1) Go to the root of your project source code clone2) If you want to check code with pylint:::    inspekt lint3) If you want to check indentation:::    inspekt indent4) If you want to check compliance to the PEP8:::    inspekt style5) If you want to check PR #123 for a project inside the autotest github area:::    inspekt github 123[1] http://autotest.github.io/</longdescription>
