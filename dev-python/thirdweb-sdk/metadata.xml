You can use the SDK's contract getter functions like `get_token`, `get_edition`, `get_nft_collection`, and `get_marketplace` to get the respective SDK contract instances. To use an NFT Collection contract for example, you can do the following.```python# Add your NFT Collection contract address hereNFT_COLLECTION_ADDRESS = &quot;0x..&quot;# And you can instantiate your contract with just one linenft_collection = sdk.get_nft_collection(NFT_COLLECTION_ADDRESS)# Now you can use any of the read-only SDK contract functionsnfts = nft_collection.get_all()print(nfts)```### Signing Transactions&gt; :warning: Never commit private keys to file tracking history, or your account could be compromised.Meanwhile, if you want to use write functions as well and connect a signer, you can use the following setup:```pythonfrom thirdweb import ThirdwebSDKfrom thirdweb.types.nft import NFTMetadataInput# Learn more about securely accessing your private key: https://portal.thirdweb.com/web3-sdk/set-up-the-sdk/securing-your-private-keyPRIVATE_KEY = &quot;&lt;your-private-key-here&gt;&quot;,# Now you can create a new instance of the SDK with your private keysdk = ThirdwebSDK.from_private_key(PRIVATE_KEY, &quot;mumbai&quot;)# Instantiate a new NFT Collection contract as described above.NFT_COLLECTION_ADDRESS = &quot;0x..&quot;nft_collection = sdk.get_nft_collection(NFT_COLLECTION_ADDRESS)# Now you can use any of the SDK contract functions including write functionsnft_collection.mint(NFTMetadataInput.from_json({ &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Cool NFT&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Minted with the Python SDK!&quot; }))```## Development EnvironmentIn this section, we'll go over the steps to get started with running the Python SDK repository locally and contributing to the code. If you aren't interested in contributing to the thirdweb Python SDK, you can ignore this section.### Poetry Environment SetupIf you want to work with this repository, make sure to setup [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/), you're virtual environment, and the code styling tools.Assuming you've installed and setup poetry, you can setup this repository with:```bash$ poetry shell$ poetry install$ poetry run yarn global add ganache$ poetry run yarn add hardhat```Alternatively, if your system can run .sh files, you can set everything up by running the following bash script:```bash$ bash scripts/env/setup.sh```### Running TestsBefore running tests, make sure you've already run `poetry shell` and are in the poetry virutal environment with all dependencies installed.Once you have checked that this you have all the dependencies, you can run the following:```bash$ poetry run brownie test --network hardhat```To properly setup testing, you'll also need to add your private key to the `.env` file as follows (do NOT use a private key of one of your actual wallets):```.envPRIVATE_KEY=...```### Code Style SetupMake sure you have `mypy`, `pylint`, and `black` installed (all included in the dev dependencies with `poetry install`.If you're working in VSCode, there a few steps to get everything working with the poetry .venv:1. To setup poetry virtual environment inside your VSCode so it gets recognized as part of your project (import for linters), you can take the following steps from this [stack overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59882884/vscode-doesnt-show-poetry-virtualenvs-in-select-interpreter-option). You need to run `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true` and then make sure you delete/create a new poetry env.2. In `.vscode/settings.json`, you should have the following:```json{  &quot;python.linting.mypyEnabled&quot;: true,  &quot;python.linting.enabled&quot;: true,  &quot;python.linting.pylintEnabled&quot;: false}```3. Make sure to set your VSCode `Python: Interpreter` setting to the Python version inside your poetry virtual environment.### Generate Python ABI WrappersUse the [abi-gen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0x/abi-gen) package to create the Python ABIs. You can install it with the following command:```bash$ npm install -g @0x/abi-gen```Assuming you have the thirdweb contract ABIs in this directory at `/abi`, you can run the following command to generate the necessary ABIs.```bash$ make abi```</longdescription>
