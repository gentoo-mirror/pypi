Multiple wheelsare distributed as well as source. If a wheel is not published for the pythonversion and platform you are using, you will need to compile crc32c using aC toolchain.# Currently Published WheelsWheels are currently published for Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 andpypy-3.7 for multiple architectures. For information on building your own,please view [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).## LinuxWheels are published for the following platforms / architectures:- `manylinux2010` platform, `x86_64` and `1686` architectures- `manylinux2014` platform, `aarch64` architecture### Deprecated- `manylinux1` platform, `x86_64` architecture wheels will be built until  2021-12-31, when the PyPA group drops support for the `manylinux1` image.  See: https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/994 ## Mac OSWheels are published for `x86_64` and `universal2` architectures.## WindowsWheels are published for `win32` and `win_amd64` architectures.</longdescription>
