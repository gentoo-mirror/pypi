	<longdescription># Copy number genotyping from scRNA sequencing[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Militeee/anneal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Militeee/congas)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Militeee/anneal/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/Militeee/congas)A set of Pyro models and functions to infer CNA from scRNA-seq data. It comes with a companion R package (hlink) that works as an interface and provides preprocessing, simulation and visualization routines.Currently providing:- A mixture model on segments where CNV are modelled as LogNormal random variable (MixtureGaussian) - Same as above but the number of cluster is learned (MixtureGaussianDMP)- A model where CNVs are modelled as outcome from Categorical distributions, clusters share the same parameters (MixtureDirichlet)- A simple Hmm where CNVs are again categorical, but there is no clustering (SimpleHmm)- The version of MixtureDirichlet but with temporal dependency  (HmmMixtureRNA)Coming soon:- A linear model in the emission that can account for known covariates- The equivalent of MixtureGaussian but with CNVs as Categorical random variable- A model on genes (all the other models assume a division in segments)To install:`$ pip install congas`To run a simple analysis on the example data```pythonimport congas as cnfrom congas.models import MixtureGaussiandata_dict = cn.simulation_dataparams, loss = cn.run_analysis(data_dict,MixtureGaussian, steps=200, lr=0.05)```[Full Documentation](https://annealpyro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)</longdescription>
