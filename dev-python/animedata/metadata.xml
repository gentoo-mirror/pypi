	<longdescription># AnimeData## PresentationAnimeData is a python-based project developed by swarthur.The project's goal is to offer an open-source and easy way to get data about its favourite animes and series.AnimeData is composed of 2 main files :1. *animedata.py* : Python module essential to exploit and modify the JSON database.2. *animedata_source.json* : JSON file : series database.## Data availableSome data about an anime may be missing, especially if the anime has been added a long time ago. However, each anime should be compatible with the latest version of AnimeData.## How to use this libraryIn order to make this project useful for everyone, anybody can use the provided tool to get, add or modify its animes or series, **from a compatible manager**.&gt; Currently, only AnimeTime is compatible with showdata.### How does the tool works ?The tool's input needs to be an dictionnary, specially formatted, with special keys provided in a dictionnary in the module.Example of formatted python dictionnary :```pyjson_dict = {&quot;anime_name&quot;:{    &quot;seasons_episodes&quot;:{        &quot;episode_number&quot;:{            &quot;episode_name&quot; : &quot;episode_name&quot;,            &quot;episode_duration&quot; : 00,            &quot;episode_release_date&quot; : [MM,DD,YYYY]            }        ...} # Others episodes        }    ...} # Others series ```### Does another JSON file is compatible ?AnimeData uses metadata, and corruped metadata stops the tool from loading the data.The AnimeData loading-friendly files are :* animedata_source.json : source file of the database* animedata_local.json : custom file, similar to the source file but containing custom data from an series manager.The AnimeData saving-friendly files is:* animedata_local.json : custom file used to save anime's custom data from a compatible anime manager.</longdescription>
