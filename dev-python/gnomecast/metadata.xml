	<longdescription>.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keredson/gnomecast/master/screenshot.png   :alt: alt text   alt textGnomeCast=========This is a native Linux GUI for casting local files to ChromeCastdevices. It supports:-  Both audio and video files (anything ``ffmpeg`` can read)-  Realtime transcoding (only when needed)-  Subtitles (embedded and external SRT files)-  Fast scrubbing (waiting 20s for buffering to skip 30s ahead is   wrong!)Install-------Please run:::    $ pip3 install gnomecastIf installing in a ``mkvirtualenv`` built virtual environment, make sureyou include the ``--system-site-packages`` parameter to get the GTKbindings.Run---::    $ gnomecastIf you see:.. code:: python    AttributeError: module 'html5lib.treebuilders' has no attribute '_base'This is a known bug in ``html5lib`` (used by ``pycaptions``). Run thisto fix it:::    # pip3 install --upgrade html5lib==1.0b8*Please report bugs!*Thanks To...-------------  https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast-  https://github.com/pbs/pycaption-  https://www.ffmpeg.org/And everyone who made this project #2 on GitHub's trending list! That'sso awesome!!!.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keredson/gnomecast/master/trending.png   :alt: alt text   alt textTranscoding-----------Chromecasts only support a handful of media formats. See:https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/mediaSo some amount of transcoding is necessary if your video files don'tconform. But we're smart about it. If you have an ``.mkv`` file with``h264`` video and ``AAC`` audio, we use ``ffmpeg`` to simply rewritethe container (to ``.mp4``) without touching the underlying streams,which my XPS 13 can at around 100x realtime (it's fully IO bound).Now if you have that same ``.mkv`` file with and ``A3C`` audio stream(which Chromecast doesn't support) we'll rewrite the container, copy the``h264`` stream as is and only transcode the audio (at about 20x).If neither your file's audio or video streams are supported, then it'lldo a full transcode (at around 5x).We write the entire transcoded file to your ``/tmp`` directory in orderto make scrubbing fast and glitch-free, a good trade-off IMO. Hopefullyyou're not running your drive at less than one video's worth of freespace!Subtitles---------Chromecast only supports a handful of subtitle formats, ``.srt`` notincluded. But it does support`WebVTT &lt;https://w3c.github.io/webvtt/&gt;`__. So we extract whateversubtitles are in your video, convert them to WebVTT, and then reattachthem to the video through Chomecast's API.</longdescription>
