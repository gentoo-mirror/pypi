Sampling from DPPs isa nontrivial matter, and many approaches have been proposed. DPPy is a`Python &lt;https://www.python.org/&gt;`__ library that puts together allexact and approximate sampling algorithms for DPPs.Installation------------DPPy works with `Python 3.6+ &lt;http://docs.python.org/3/&gt;`__.Dependencies~~~~~~~~~~~~This project depends on the following libraries, which are automatically downloaded during installation:-  `NumPy &lt;http://www.numpy.org&gt;`__-  `SciPy &lt;http://www.scipy.org/&gt;`__-  `Matplotlib &lt;http://matplotlib.org/&gt;`__The following dependencies are optional, and unlock extra functionality if installed:-  `Networkx &lt;http://networkx.github.io/&gt;`__ to play with `uniform   spanning   trees &lt;https://dppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exotic_dpps/index.html#uniform-spanning-trees&gt;`__ .-  `CVXOPT &lt;http://cvxopt.org&gt;`__ to use the ``zono_sampling`` MCMC   sampler for finite DPPs. **CVXOPT itself requires**   `GCC &lt;http://gcc.gnu.org&gt;`__,   -  On MAC it comes with      `Xcode &lt;https://developer.apple.com/xcode/&gt;`__   -  On UNIX, use your package manager (``apt``, ``yum`` etc)      .. code:: bash          sudo apt install -qq gcc g++-  `Sphinx &lt;http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/&gt;`__ to modify and rebuild the documentationInstallation instructions~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~DPPy is now available on `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/dppy/&gt;`__ |PyPI package|.. code:: bash  pip install dppyFor a full installation, including extra dependencies and dependencies necessary to build the documentation (see above), use :code:`pip install dppy['zonotope','trees','docs']`.Note that only stable DPPy releases are available on PyPI, and recently included improvements might only be available on the git master branch. If you want to work with the latest version of DPPy1. If you have a GitHub account please consider forking DPPy and use git to clone your copy of the repo   .. code:: bash       cd &lt;directory_of_your_choice&gt;       git clone https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/DPPy.git2. If you only use git, clone this repository   .. code:: bash       cd &lt;directory_of_your_choice&gt;       git clone https://github.com/guilgautier/DPPy.git3. Otherwise simply download the project4. In any case, install the project with   .. code:: bash       cd DPPy       pip install .Use :code:`pip install .['zonotope','trees','docs']` to perform a full install from a local source tree.How to use it-------------The main DPPy documentation is available online at `http://dppy.readthedocs.io &lt;http://dppy.readthedocs.io&gt;`_.There are also some interactive tutorials using Jupyter available at https://github.com/guilgautier/DPPy/blob/master/notebooks/.For more details, check below.Tutorials in `Jupyter notebooks &lt;https://github.com/guilgautier/DPPy/blob/master/notebooks/&gt;`_~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~You can read and work on these interactive tutorial `Notebooks &lt;https://github.com/guilgautier/DPPy/blob/master/notebooks/&gt;`_, directly from yourweb browser, without having to download or install Python or anything.Just click, wait a little bit, and play with the notebook!Building the documentation~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The`documentation &lt;http://dppy.readthedocs.io/&gt;`__is generated locally with`Sphinx &lt;http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/&gt;`__ and then built onlineby `ReadTheDocs &lt;https://readthedocs.org/projects/dppy/&gt;`__.If you wish to contribute to the documentation or just play with itlocally, you can install the necessary dependencies and then:-  Generate the docs locally   .. code:: bash       cd DPPy/docs       make html-  Open the local HTML version of the documentation located at   ``DPPy/docs/_build/html/index.html``   .. code:: bash       open _build/html/index.htmlHow to cite this work?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`We wrote a companion paper to DPPy which got accepted for publication in the Machine Learning Open Source Software track of JMLR &lt;http://jmlr.org/papers/v20/19-179.html&gt;`__.If you use the DPPy toolbox, please consider citing it with this piece ofBibTeX:.. code:: bibtex  @article{GPBV19,    author = {Gautier, Guillaume and Polito, Guillermo and Bardenet, R{\'{e}}mi and Valko, Michal},    journal = {Journal of Machine Learning Research - Machine Learning Open Source Software (JMLR-MLOSS)},    title = {{DPPy: DPP Sampling with Python}},    keywords = {Computer Science - Machine Learning, Computer Science - Mathematical Software, Statistics - Machine Learning},    url = {http://jmlr.org/papers/v20/19-179.html},    year = {2019},    archivePrefix = {arXiv},    arxivId = {1809.07258},    note = {Code at http://github.com/guilgautier/DPPy/ Documentation at http://dppy.readthedocs.io/}  }Many of the algorithms implemented in DPPy also have associated literature that you should consider citing.Please refer to the `bibliography on the documentation page &lt;https://dppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bibliography/&gt;`__ and docstrings of each specific DPP sampler for details.Reproducibility---------------We would like to thank `Guillermo Polito &lt;https://guillep.github.io/&gt;`__for leading our reproducible research`workgroup &lt;https://github.com/CRIStAL-PADR/reproducible-research-SE-notes&gt;`__,this project owes him a lot.Take a look at the corresponding`booklet &lt;https://github.com/CRIStAL-PADR/reproducible-research-SE-notes&gt;`__to learn more on how to make your research reproducible!</longdescription>
