	<longdescription>color-matcher enables color transfer across images which comes in handy for automatic color-gradingof photographs, paintings and film sequences as well as light-field and stopmotion corrections. The methods behindthe mappings are based on the approach from Reinhard et al., the Monge-Kantorovich Linearization (MKL) as proposed byPitie et al. and our analytical solution to a Multi-Variate Gaussian Distribution (MVGD) transfer in conjunction withclassical histogram matching. As shown below our HM-MVGD-HM compound outperforms existing methods.</longdescription>
