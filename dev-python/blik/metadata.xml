It leverages the fast, multi-dimensional [napari viewer](https://napari.org) and the scientific python stack.**DISCLAIMER**: this package is in development phase. Expect bugs and crashes. Please, report them on the issue tracker and ask if anything is unclear!## InstallationYou can either install `blik` through the [napari plugin system](https://napari.org/plugins/index.html), through pip, or get both napari and blik directly with:```bashpip install &quot;blik[all]&quot;```The `[all]` qualifier also installs `pyqt5` as the napari GUI backend, and a few additional napari plugins that you might find useful in your workflow:- [napari-properties-plotter](https://github.com/brisvag/napari-properties-plotter)- [napari-properties-viewer](https://github.com/kevinyamauchi/napari-properties-viewer)- [napari-label-interpolator](https://github.com/brisvag/napari-label-interpolator)### Nightly buildIf you'd like the most up to date `blik` possible, you can install directly from the `main` branch on github. This also uses napari `main`, so expect some instability!```pip install &quot;git+https://github.com/brisvag/blik.git@main#egg=blik[all]&quot;pip install &quot;git+https://github.com/napari/napari.git@main#egg=napari[all]&quot;```## Basic UsageFrom the command line:```bashnapari -w blik -- /path/to.star /path/to/mrc/files/*```The `-w blik` is important for proper initialization of all the layers. Always open the main widget open to ensure nothing goes wrong!*`blik` is just `napari`*. Particles and images are exposed as simple napari layers, which can be analysed and manipulated with simple python, and most importantly other [napari plugins](https://napari-hub.org/).## WidgetsThe main widget has a few functions:- `experiment`: quickly switch to a different experiment id (typically, everything related to an individual tomogram such as volume, particles and segmentations)- `new`: generate a new `segmentation`, a new manually-picked set of `particles`, or a new `surface picking` or `filament picking` for segmentation, particle generation or volume resampling.- `add to exp`: add a layer to the currently selected `experiment` (just a shorthand for `layer.metadata['experiment_id'] = current_exp_id`)&lt;!-- - `slice_thickness`: changes the slicing thickness in all dimensions in napari. Images will be averaged over that thickness, and all particles in the slice will be displayed. --&gt;  &lt;!-- only available in napari 0.5.0 --&gt;There are also widgets for picking of both surfaces and filaments.- `surface`: process a previously picked `surface picking` layer to generate a surface mesh and distribute particles on it for subtomogram averaging, or resample a tomogram along the surface.- `filament`: process a previously picked `filament picking` layer to generate a filament and distribute particles on it for subtomogram averaging, or resample a tomogram along the filament.</longdescription>
