	<longdescription>Toytable========This is the last release of ToyTable, henceforth the package will be known as EZTable. Previously this project was hostedon mercurial, in the future it will be on github: https://github.com/salimfadhley/eztableToytable is a lightweight python table library. It provides a class called Table  which is suitable for representing one-dimensional tables (e.g. time-sequences).It is suitable for data analysis tasks. Toytable is built with an emphasis on simplicity, both in interface and internal design rather than performance or scalability. Toytable is intended to have as few dependancies as possible, and is therefore suitable for casual development tasks.Toytable is not intended for high performance or scalability. Toytable is not complete. For these reasons, please consider evaluating other more mature packages (e.g. Pandas).Project Status--------------.. image:: https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/salimfadhley/toytable/status.png   :target: https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/salimfadhley/toytable.. image:: https://pypip.in/wheel/toytable/badge.png        :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/toytable/.. image:: https://pypip.in/license/toytable/badge.png        :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/toytable/.. image:: https://pypip.in/download/toytable/badge.png    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi//toytable/    :alt: Downloads    .. image:: https://requires.io/bitbucket/salimfadhley/toytable/requirements.png?branch=default     :target: https://requires.io/bitbucket/salimfadhley/toytable/requirements/?branch=default     :alt: Requirements StatusAbout this project------------------* Documentation: http://toytable.readthedocs.org* Latest release: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/toytable/* Latest source: https://bitbucket.org/salimfadhley/toytable* Issues: https://bitbucket.org/salimfadhley/toytable/issues?status=new&amp;status=open</longdescription>
