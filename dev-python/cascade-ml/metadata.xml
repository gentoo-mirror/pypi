Cascade built for individuals or small teams that are in need of ML Engineering solution, but don't have time or resources to use large enterprise-level systems.  **Included in [Model Lifecycle](https://github.com/kelvins/awesome-mlops#model-lifecycle) section of Awesome MLOps list**## Installation```bashpip install cascade-ml```More info on installation can be found in [documentation](https://oxid15.github.io/cascade/quickstart.html#installation)## Documentation[Go to Cascade documentation](https://oxid15.github.io/cascade/)## UsageThis section is divided into blocks based on what problem you can solve using Cascade. These are the simplest examplesof what the library is capable of. See more in documentation.### ETL pipeline trackingData processing pipelines need to be versioned and tracked as a part of model experiments.  To track changes and version everything about data Cascade has Datasets - special wrappersthat encapsulate changes that are done during preprocessing.```pythonfrom cascade import data as cddfrom sklearn.datasets import load_digitsimport numpy as np# Load datasetX, y = load_digits(return_X_y=True)pairs = [(x, y) for (x, y) in zip(X, y)]# To track all preparation stages we wrap cdd.Dataset over# collection of items and targetsds = cdd.Wrapper(pairs)# Let's make a pipeline - shuffle the datasetds = cdd.RandomSampler(ds)# Splitting the data is also tracked in pipeline's metadatatrain_ds, test_ds = cdd.split(ds)# Add small noise to imagestrain_ds = cdd.ApplyModifier(    train_ds,    lambda pair: pair + np.random.random() * 0.1 - 0.05)# Let's see the metadata we gotfrom pprint import pprintpprint(train_ds.get_meta())```We see all the stages that we did in meta.```json[{&quot;len&quot;: 898,  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;cascade.data.apply_modifier.ApplyModifier&quot;,  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;dataset&quot;}, {&quot;len&quot;: 898,  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;cascade.data.range_sampler.RangeSampler&quot;,  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;dataset&quot;}, {&quot;len&quot;: 1797,  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;cascade.data.random_sampler.RandomSampler&quot;,  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;dataset&quot;}, {&quot;len&quot;: 1797,  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;cascade.data.dataset.Wrapper&quot;,  &quot;obj_type&quot;: &quot;&lt;class 'list'&gt;&quot;,  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;dataset&quot;}]```However, the pipelines are changing frequently and these changes during experiments are rarely got version-tracked.Cascade has a solution for this.```python# We save the dataset's meta into the version log# if something will change in the pipeline# the version will be updatedcdd.VersionAssigner(train_ds, 'version_log.yml')```See all datasets in [zoo](https://oxid15.github.io/cascade/examples/dataset_zoo.html)  See all use-cases in [documentation](https://oxid15.github.io/cascade/quickstart.html)### Experiment trackingNot only data and pipelines changes over time. Models change more frequently and require special system to handle experiments and artifacts.```pythonfrom cascade import models as cdmfrom cascade import data as cddfrom sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancerfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_splitfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_scoreX, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)# Define the simple model that using# basic methods from cdm.BasicModelclass BaselineModel(cdm.BasicModel):    def __init__(self, const=0, *args, **kwargs) -&gt; None:        self.const = const        super().__init__(const=const, *args, **kwargs)    def predict(self, x, *args, **kwargs):        return [self.const for _ in range(len(x))]    # Models define the way whey are trained loaded and saved    # we don't use these here, but they exist    def fit(self, *args, **kwargs):        pass    def save(self, path):        passmodel = BaselineModel(1)# Fit and evaluate do not return anythingmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, {'acc': accuracy_score, 'f1': f1_score})# Model repository is the solution for experiment and artifact storagerepo = cdm.ModelRepo('repos/use_case_repo')# Repo is the collection of model lines# Line can be a bunch of experiments on one model typeline = repo.add_line('baseline')# We save the model - everything is held automaticallyline.save(model, only_meta=True)from pprint import pprintpprint(model.get_meta())```Let's see what is saved as meta data of this experiment.```json[    {        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;&lt;__main__.BaselineModel object at 0x000001F69F493820&gt;&quot;,        &quot;created_at&quot;: &quot;2023-01-02T16:36:59.041979+00:00&quot;,        &quot;metrics&quot;: {            &quot;acc&quot;: 0.6293706293706294,            &quot;f1&quot;: 0.7725321888412017        },        &quot;params&quot;: {            &quot;const&quot;: 1        },        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;model&quot;,        &quot;saved_at&quot;: &quot;2023-01-02T16:36:59.103781+00:00&quot;    }]```See all use-cases in [documentation](https://oxid15.github.io/cascade/quickstart.html)### Data validationValidation is an important part of pipelines. Simple asserts can do the thing, butthere is more useful validation tools.  Validators provide meaningful error messages and a way to perform many checks in one run over the dataset.```pythonfrom cascade import meta as cmefrom cascade import data as cddfrom sklearn.datasets import load_digitsimport numpy as np# Load dataX, y = load_digits(return_X_y=True)pairs = [(x, y) for (x, y) in zip(X, y)]# Let's define a pipelineds = cdd.Wrapper(pairs)ds = cdd.RandomSampler(ds)train_ds, test_ds = cdd.split(ds)# Validate using this toolcme.PredicateValidator(    train_ds,    [        lambda pair: all(pair[0] &lt; 20),        lambda pair: pair[1] in (i for i in range(10))    ])```See all use-cases in [documentation](https://oxid15.github.io/cascade/quickstart.html)### Metadata analysisDuring experiments Cascade produces many metadata which can be analyzed later.`MetricViewer` is the tool that allows to see the relationship between parameters andmetrics of all models in repository.```pythonfrom cascade import meta as cmefrom cascade import models as cdm# Open the existing reporepo = cdm.ModelRepo('repos/use_case_repo')# This runs web-server that relies on optional dependencycme.MetricViewer(repo).serve()```![metric-viewer](cascade/docs/imgs/metric-viewer.gif)`HistoryViewer` allows to see model's lineage, what parameters resulted in what metrics```pythonfrom cascade import meta as cmefrom cascade import models as cdmrepo = cdm.ModelRepo('repos/use_case_repo')# This returns plotly figurecme.HistoryViewer(repo).plot()# This runs a server ans allows to see changes in real time (for example while models are trained)cme.HistoryViewer(repo).serve()```See all use-cases in [documentation](https://oxid15.github.io/cascade/quickstart.html)![history-viewer](cascade/docs/imgs/history-viewer.gif)## Who could find Cascade usefulSmall and fast-prototyping AI-teams could use it as a tradeoff between total missingness of any ML-Engineering framework and demanding enterprise solutions.## PrinciplesThe key principles of Cascade are:* **Elegancy** - ML code should be about ML with minimum meta-code* **Flexibility** - to easily build prototypes and integrate existing projects with Cascade *(don't pay for what you don't use)** **Reusability** - code to be reused in similar projects with no effort* **Traceability** - everything should have meta-data## ContributingPull requests and issues are welcome!
