	<longdescription>Inspect.When documenting a library or software product written in Python, oftena README is not enough, but full-blown Sphinx is too much work or toorigid.Inspect is a command-line tool that will automatically document Pythoncode, but it returns the output as machine-readable JSON orhuman-readable Markdown, so you retain full control of how to render thedocumentation.Usage: inspect [] [options]Options: -m --markdown At what level to start headers. --include ...--exclude ...If you only need a single object documented (whether a function, a classor something else), you can use the.. raw:: html   &lt;object&gt; argument:::    # will only include documentation on `A`    inspect fixtures/example.py AFiltering the output with ``--include`` and ``--exclude`` ensures thatyour code description only contains exactly what you want it to. Someexamples:::    # only include class methods if they've been documented    inspect fixtures/example.py --include members.documented    # only include classes    inspect fixtures/example.py --include type:class    # only document function `factorize` and class `Bean`    inspect fixtures/example.py --include name:fun,name:B    # only include documented methods on Bean    # (these two are identical)    inspect fixtures/example.py Bean --include documented    inspect fixtures/example.py --include name:Bean,members.documentedAs you can see, ``.`` traverses the hierarchy and ``:`` is the value totest against. (If you don't specify a value, we will test on presence.)``,`` separates multiple criteria that are OR'ed together.Todo:-  improve documentation-  unit test the filtering mechanism-  fill out missing information in the description JSON (if any)-  an ``intercalate`` utility that runs shell commands inside of ``%%``   tags in a file and replaces the tags with the standard output from   those commands</longdescription>
