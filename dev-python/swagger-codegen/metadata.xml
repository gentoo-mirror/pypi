	<longdescription>## Swagger codegen for Python![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/asyncee/swagger_codegen/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)### Installation```bashpip install swagger-codegen```### Swagger versionCurrently, only OpenApi 3.x (aka Swagger 3) is supported. ### Usage example```# Generate Petstore Api client using 'petstore' package name.swagger_codegen generate https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json petstorepythonPython 3.8.1 (default, Jan 23 2020, 13:58:52) [Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.16)] on darwinType &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.&gt;&gt;&gt; from petstore import new_client, Configuration&gt;&gt;&gt; from swagger_codegen.api.adapter.requests import RequestsAdapter&gt;&gt;&gt; from petstore.apis.user.createUser import User&gt;&gt;&gt; client = new_client(RequestsAdapter(), Configuration(host=&quot;http://petstore3.swagger.io&quot;))&gt;&gt;&gt; pets = client.pet.findPetsByStatus()&gt;&gt;&gt; print(pets)[Pet(category=Category(id=1, name='Dogs'), id=69, name='aHldog', photoUrls=['string'], status='available',...]```You can see [example source code](https://github.com/asyncee/swagger_codegen/tree/master/example)for [PetStore](http://petstore3.swagger.io/) Api in example directory of a project.You can test example client with following command:```bash# Run from project directory.python -m example.petstore_example ```### Code generators (also known as renderers)There are two code generator strategies in project:1. Render client as usual python package via `PackageRenderer`2. Render client as installable python package via `InstallablePackageRenderer`You can choose what renderer to use by specifying `renderer` key in `.swagger-codegen.toml`file. Please see `.swagger-codegen.toml.example` for allowed values.### Known issues- Content of generated files differs run-to-run because each time functions or  data transfer objects ordered differently. Functionally clients stay the same, but  each time the code is generated there are a large diff generated by git.- Not fully Openapi compliant: the project was built to fulfill my personal needs:  a support for FastAPI-generated schemas, and I needed this feature quickly,  that is why there are too many large dependencies (`schemathesis`) and incompatibilities.  Anyway, I'm looking forward to fixing this issues by time.- There are may be delays in reaction to issues due to small amount of free time  (however PR's with tests are merged asap).### Work in progressThough library gives nice results for generated API, it is still in development.Some tests are missing. API is a subject to change until stable release.Anyway backward compatibility will be kept as much as possible.The code is not optimized yet and mostly dirty because the project was bornas a holiday prototype.Also `example` directory may be out of sync with actual generated code.### ContributorsYou can see all people who helped this project [at the contributors page](https://github.com/asyncee/swagger_codegen/graphs/contributors)</longdescription>
