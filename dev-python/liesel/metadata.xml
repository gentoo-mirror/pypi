	<longdescription>&lt;!-- This README is for PyPI. The README for GitHub is in .github/README.md --&gt;# Liesel: A Probabilistic Programming Framework&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liesel-devs/liesel/main/misc/logo/logo-light.png&quot; alt=&quot;logo&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;185&quot;&gt;Liesel is a probabilistic programming framework with a focus on semi-parametric regression. It includes:- [**Liesel**](https://github.com/liesel-devs/liesel), a library to express statistical models as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). Through the PGM representation, the user can build and update models in a natural way.- **Goose**, a library to build custom MCMC algorithms with several parameter blocks and MCMC kernels such as the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), the Iteratively Weighted Least Squares (IWLS) sampler, or different Gibbs samplers. Goose also takes care of the MCMC bookkeeping and the chain post-processing.- [**RLiesel**](https://github.com/liesel-devs/rliesel), an R interface for Liesel which assists the user with the configuration of semi-parametric regression models such as Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) with different response distributions, spline-based smooth terms and shrinkage priors.The name &quot;Liesel&quot; is an homage to the [Gänseliesel fountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A4nseliesel), landmark of Liesel's birth city [Göttingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6ttingen).## Resources- [Paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10975)- [Liesel &amp; Goose repo](https://github.com/liesel-devs/liesel)- [Liesel &amp; Goose API docs](https://docs.liesel-project.org)- [RLiesel repo](https://github.com/liesel-devs/rliesel)- [Tutorials](https://liesel-devs.github.io/liesel-tutorials)</longdescription>
