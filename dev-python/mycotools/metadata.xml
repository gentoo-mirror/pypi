Kindly report them.If you can find the bug, even better! The goal is to reach a longterm stablerelease, though maintaining the software for my use is currently the priority.# PURPOSEBring broadscale comparative genomics to the masses. Mycotools is a compilation of computational biology tools and database [MycotoolsDB](https://github.com/xonq/mycotools/blob/master/MTDB.md) software that facilitate large-scale fungal comparative genomics. MycotoolsDB locally assimilates all NCBI and MycoCosm (Joint Genome Institute) genomes into a database schema with uniform file curation, scalability, and automation as guiding principles. - Database initialization is as simple as `mtdb u --init &lt;DIR&gt;`- `mtdb u --update` brings the database to the current date- The MycotoolsDB (MTDB) uniformly curates the numerous iterations of  the `gff`, allowing for reliable analyses and format expectations from  multiple eras- The `.mtdb` database format enables swift transitions from analyses with datasets of 100,000s genomes to as few as a lineage of interest- The MycotoolsDB can be adminstered by one administrator and accessed by  multiple users that integrate via `mtdb -i &lt;DB_DIR&gt;`&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;    &lt;img        src=&quot;https://gitlab.com/xonq/mycotools/-/raw/master/misc/mtdb.png&quot;    &gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mycotools facilitates routine-complextasks like retrieving locus, `gff`, or `fasta` accessions; running and compiling`fasta`s of MycotoolsDB BLAST/hmmsearches; automated phylogenetic analysispipelines from BLAST to Pfam extraction to tree prediction, etc etc. Mycotoolsincludes sets of utilities that also enable easy acquisition of batches ofsequence data using `ncbiDwnld.py` and `jgiDwnld.py`. Please see the [USAGEguide](https://github.com/xonq/mycotools/blob/master/USAGE.md) formore information.&lt;br /&gt;# USAGECheck out [README.md](https://github.com/xonq/mycotools/blob/master/README.md) for install and the [USAGE.md](https://github.com/xonq/mycotools/blob/master/USAGE.md) for a guide. &lt;br /&gt;# CITINGIf Mycotools contribute to your analysis, please cite this git repository (github.com/xonq/mycotools) and mention the Mycotools version in line.---&lt;br /&gt;# INSTALL## 1. Installing minicondaMiniconda3 is a software environment manager:```bashcurl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh &gt; ~/miniconda3.shbash ~/miniconda3.sh```Activate miniconda and initialize it so it starts up automatically```bashsource activate base # if this fails run conda activate baseconda init```&lt;br /&gt;## 2. Setting up minicondaSetup and prioritize channels for your miniconda installation. This step must becompleted for new and old installs.```bashconda config --add channels defaultsconda config --add channels biocondaconda config --add channels conda-forgeconda config --set channel_priority strict```&lt;br /&gt;## 3. Installing mycotoolsMake sure `conda` is active, usually by seeing `(base)` in in your shell.If not, try `conda activate base` or `source activate base`. ```bashconda create -n mycotools mycotools -c xonq -yconda activate mycotoolspython3 -m pip install mycotools --upgrademtdb -d```NOTE: There is an unfortunate build dependency conflict with the conda package,so be sure to explicitly run `pip install` as noted above to update themycotools package inside the conda environment.&lt;br /&gt;Determine if you are going to link to an already installed database, or becomethe administrator of a new one:## 4a. USER: Integrate with already initialized MycotoolsDBTo link with an existing database, fill in `&lt;PATH&gt;` with the database path```bashmtdb --init &lt;DB_PATH&gt;```You're good to proceed to the[usage guide!](https://gitlab.com/xonq/mycotools/-/blob/master/USAGE.md)## 4b. ADMINISTRATOR: Initialize a local MycotoolsDB```bashmtdb update --init &lt;DB_PATH&gt;```&lt;br /&gt;# UPDATEMycotools is currently in an advanced beta state with frequent updates. It isrecommended to run the following in your conda environment if you are havingtrouble with analyses:```bashpython3 -m pip install mycotools --upgrade```NOTE: Make sure the conda environment is active when updating.I recommend updating with `pip` because the `conda` distribution is currently prone to dependency issues and will not update reliably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;### A NOTE ON THE CODEEach standalone script is written with `__name__ == '__main__'`, designed tohandle running the script from the command line, as well as `main` function(s),which are importable modules executing the purpose of the script. This enables Mycotoolsto be a pipelining-friendly software suite, both from a command line andpython scripting standpoint.Code edits should focus on stabilizing existing features and simplifying/decerasing the code base.I try to implement code aligned with principles of the [functionalprogramming paradigm](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html) andmodifications should act in accord with this paradigm, i.e. sparingimplementation of new classes, limited necessary abstraction, no hidden statechanges, and function-based flow.&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://gitlab.com/xonq/mycotools/-/raw/master/misc/ablogo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</longdescription>
