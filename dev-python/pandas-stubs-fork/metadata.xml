	<longdescription># pandas-stubs: Public type stubs for pandas[![PyPI Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pandas-stubs.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas-stubs/)[![Conda Latest Release](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pandas-stubs/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pandas-stubs)[![Package Status](https://img.shields.io/pypi/status/pandas-stubs.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas-stubs/)[![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/pandas-stubs.svg)](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs/blob/main/LICENSE)[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/pandas-stubs?period=month&amp;units=international_system&amp;left_color=black&amp;right_color=orange&amp;left_text=PyPI%20downloads%20per%20month)](https://pepy.tech/project/pandas-stubs)[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/pydata/pandas)[![Powered by NumFOCUS](https://img.shields.io/badge/powered%20by-NumFOCUS-orange.svg?style=flat&amp;colorA=E1523D&amp;colorB=007D8A)](https://numfocus.org)[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)[![Imports: isort](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20imports-isort-%231674b1?style=flat&amp;labelColor=ef8336)](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)## What is it?These are public type stubs for [**pandas**](http://pandas.pydata.org/), following theconvention of providing stubs in a separate package, as specified in [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#stub-only-packages).  The stubs cover the most typical use cases ofpandas.  In general, these stubs are narrower than what is possibly allowed by pandas,but follow a convention of suggesting best recommended practices for using pandas.The stubs are likely incomplete in terms of covering the published API of pandas.The stubs are tested with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) and [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright#readme) and are currently shipped with the Visual Studio Code extension[pylance](https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release#readme).## UsageLet’s take this example piece of code in file `round.py````pythonimport pandas as pddecimals = pd.DataFrame({'TSLA': 2, 'AMZN': 1})prices = pd.DataFrame(data={'date': ['2021-08-13', '2021-08-07', '2021-08-21'],                            'TSLA': [720.13, 716.22, 731.22], 'AMZN': [3316.50, 3200.50, 3100.23]})rounded_prices = prices.round(decimals=decimals)```Mypy won't see any issues with that, but after installing pandas-stubs and running it again:```shmypy round.py```we get the following error message:```textround.py:6: error: Argument &quot;decimals&quot; to &quot;round&quot; of &quot;DataFrame&quot; has incompatible type &quot;DataFrame&quot;; expected &quot;Union[int, Dict[Any, Any], Series[Any]]&quot;  [arg-type]Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)```And, if you use pyright:```shpyright round.py```you get the following error message:```text round.py:6:40 - error: Argument of type &quot;DataFrame&quot; cannot be assigned to parameter &quot;decimals&quot; of type &quot;int | Dict[Unknown, Unknown] | Series[Unknown]&quot; in function &quot;round&quot;    Type &quot;DataFrame&quot; cannot be assigned to type &quot;int | Dict[Unknown, Unknown] | Series[Unknown]&quot;      &quot;DataFrame&quot; is incompatible with &quot;int&quot;      &quot;DataFrame&quot; is incompatible with &quot;Dict[Unknown, Unknown]&quot;      &quot;DataFrame&quot; is incompatible with &quot;Series[Unknown]&quot; (reportGeneralTypeIssues)```And after confirming with the [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.round.html)we can fix the code:```pythondecimals = pd.Series({'TSLA': 2, 'AMZN': 1})```## Version Numbering ConventionThe version number x.y.z.yymmdd corresponds to a test done with pandas version x.y.z, with the stubs released on the date mm/yy/dd.It is anticipated that the stubs will be released more frequently than pandas as the stubs are expected to evolve due to morepublic visibility.## Where to get itThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: &lt;https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs&gt;Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the [PythonPackage Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas-stubs) and on [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/).```sh# condaconda install pandas-stubs``````sh# or PyPIpip install pandas-stubs```## Dependencies- [pandas: powerful Python data analysis toolkit](https://pandas.pydata.org/)- [typing-extensions &gt;= 4.2.0 - supporting the latest typing extensions](https://github.com/python/typing_extensions#readme)## Installation from sources- Make sure you have `python &gt;= 3.8` installed.- Install poetry```sh# condaconda install poetry``````sh# or PyPIpip install poetry```- Install the project dependencies```shpoetry update -vvv```- Build and install the distribution```shpoetry run poe build_distpoetry run poe install_dist```## License[BSD 3](LICENSE)## DocumentationDocumentation is a work-in-progress.  ## BackgroundThese stubs are the result of a strategic effort lead by the core pandas team to integrate [Microsoft type stub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs)together with the [VirtusLabs pandas_stubs repository](https://github.com/VirtusLab/pandas-stubs).These stubs were initially forked from the Microsoft project &lt;https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs&gt; as of [this commit](https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs/tree/6b800063bde687cd1846122431e2a729a9de625a).We are indebted to Microsoft and that project for the initial set of public type stubs.  We are also grateful for the original pandas-stubs project at &lt;https://github.com/VirtusLab/pandas-stubs&gt; that created the framework for testing the stubs.## Differences between type declarations in pandas and pandas-stubsThe &lt;https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/&gt; project has type declarations for some parts of pandas, both for the internal and public API's.  Those type declarations are used to make sure that the pandas code is _internally_ consistent.The &lt;https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs/&gt; project provides type declarations for the pandas _public_ API.  The philosophy of these stubs can be found at &lt;https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs/blob/main/docs/philosophy.md/&gt; While it would be ideal if the `pyi` files in this project would be part of the `pandas` distribution, this would require consistency between the internal type declarations and the public declarations, and the scope of a project to create that consistency is quite large.  That is a long term goal.  Finally, another goal is to do more frequent releases of the pandas-stubs than is done for pandas, in order to make the stubs more useful.If issues are found with the public stubs, pull requests to correct those issues are welcome.  In addition, pull requests on the pandas repository to fix the same issue are welcome there as well.  However, since the goals of typing in the two projects are different (internal consistency vs. public usage), it may be a challenge to create consistent type declarations across both projects.  See &lt;https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/contributing_codebase.html#type-hints/&gt; for a discussion of typing standards used within the pandas code.## Getting helpAsk questions and report issues on the [pandas-stubs repository](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs/issues).  ## Discussion and DevelopmentMost development discussions take place on GitHub in the [pandas-stubs repository](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs/). Further, the [pandas-dev mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pandas-dev) can also be used for specialized discussions or design issues, and a [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/pydata/pandas) is available for quick development related questions.## Contributing to pandas-stubsAll contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.  See &lt;https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs/tree/main/docs/&gt; for instructions.</longdescription>
