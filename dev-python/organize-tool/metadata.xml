You cannot find anything in your downloads anddocuments? Sorting and renaming all these files by hand is too tedious?Time to automate it once and benefit from it forever.**organize** is a command line, open-source alternative to apps like Hazel (macOS)or File Juggler (Windows).## FeaturesSome highlights include:- Free and open source. Please donate if it is useful for you!- Works on macOS, Windows and Linux- Safe moving, renaming, copying of files and folders with conflict resolution options- Fast duplicate file detection- Exif tags extraction- Categorization via text extracted from PDF, DOCX and many more- Supports remote file locations like FTP, WebDAV, S3 Buckets, SSH and many more- Powerful template engine- Inline python and shell commands as filters and actions for maximum flexibility- Everything can be simulated before touching your files.## Getting started### Installationorganize works on macOS, Windows and Linux.Only python 3.8+ is needed.Install it via your package manager or from [python.org](https://python.org).Installation is done via pip. Note that the package name is `organize-tool`:```bashpip install -U organize-tool```If you want the text extraction capabilities, install with `textract` like this (the qoutes are important):```bashpip install &quot;organize-tool[texttract]&quot;```This command can also be used to update to the newest version. Now you can run `organize --help` to check if the installation was successful.### Create your first ruleIn your shell, run `organize edit` to edit the configuration:```yamlrules:  - name: &quot;Find PDFs&quot;    locations:      - ~/Downloads    subfolders: true    filters:      - extension: pdf    actions:      - echo: &quot;Found PDF!&quot;```&gt; If you have problems editing the configuration you can run `organize reveal` to reveal the configuration folder in your file manager. You can then edit the `config.yaml` in your favourite editor.save your config file and run:```shorganize run```You will see a list of all `.pdf` files you have in your downloads folder (+ subfolders).For now we only show the text `Found PDF!` for each file, but this will change soon...(If it shows `Nothing to do` you simply don't have any pdfs in your downloads folder).Run `organize edit` again and add a `move`-action to your rule:```ymlactions:  - echo: &quot;Found PDF!&quot;  - move: ~/Documents/PDFs/```Now run `organize sim` to see what would happen without touching your files.You will see that your pdf-files would be moved over to your `Documents/PDFs` folder.Congratulations, you just automated your first task. You can now run `organize run`whenever you like and all your pdfs are a bit more organized. It's that easy.&gt; There is so much more. You want to rename / copy files, run custom shell- or python scripts, match names with regular expressions or use placeholder variables? organize has you covered. Have a look at the advanced usage example below!## Example rulesHere are some examples of simple organization and cleanup rules. Modify to your needs!Move all invoices, orders or purchase documents into your documents folder:```yamlrules:  - name: &quot;Sort my invoices and receipts&quot;    locations: ~/Downloads    subfolders: true    filters:      - extension: pdf      - name:          contains:            - Invoice            - Order            - Purchase          case_sensitive: false    actions:      - move: ~/Documents/Shopping/```Recursively delete all empty directories:```yamlrules:  - name: &quot;Recursively delete all empty directories&quot;    locations:      - path: ~/Downloads    targets: dirs    subfolders: true    targets: dirs    filters:      - empty    actions:      - delete```&lt;!--&lt;details markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;summary markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Advanced example&lt;/summary&gt;This example shows some advanced features like placeholder variables, pluggableactions, limited recursion through subfolders and filesystems (FTP and ZIP):This rule:- Searches recursively in your documents folder (three levels deep) and on a FTP server- for files with **pdf** or **docx** extension- that have a created timestamp- Asks for user confirmation for each file- Moves them according to their extensions and **created** timestamps:- `script.docx` will be moved to `~/Documents/DOCX/2018-01/script.docx`- `demo.pdf` will be moved to `~/Documents/PDF/2016-12/demo.pdf`- If this new is already taken, a counter is appended to the filename (&quot;rename_new&quot;)- Creates a zip backup file on your desktop containing all files.```yamlrules:  - name: &quot;Download, cleanup and backup&quot;    locations:      - path: ~/Documents        max_depth: 3      - path: ftps://demo:demo@demo.wftpserver.com    filters:      - extension:          - pdf          - docx      - created    actions:      - confirm:          msg: &quot;Really continue?&quot;          default: true      - move:          dest: &quot;~/Documents/{extension.upper()}/{created.strftime('%Y-%m')}/&quot;          on_conflict: rename_new      - copy: &quot;zip:///Users/thomas/Desktop/backup.zip&quot;```&lt;/details&gt;--&gt;You'll find many more examples in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tfeldmann.github.io/organize&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;full documentation&lt;/a&gt;.## Command line interface```shUsage: organize [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...  organize  The file management automation tool.Options:  --version   Show the version and exit.  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.Commands:  run     Organizes your files according to your rules.  sim     Simulates a run (does not touch your files).  edit    Edit the rules.  check   Checks whether a given config file is valid.  reveal  Reveals the default config file.  schema  Prints the json schema for config files.  docs    Opens the documentation.```## Other donation options:ETH:```0x8924a060CD533699E230C5694EC95b26BC4168E7```BTC:```39vpniiZk8qqGB2xEqcDjtWxngFCCdWGjY```</longdescription>
