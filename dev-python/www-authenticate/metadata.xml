	<longdescription>WWW-Authenticate header parser==============================Parsing WWW-Authenticate headers is difficult. Let this tiny library do all thehard work for you.What's so difficult?--------------------The header contains a set of comma-separated challenges, but the parameters foreach challenge are also comma-separated. Some challenges in the wild don't haveparameters, which violates the spec. The ``Negotiate`` challenge eschews therequired name-value pairs and has a single string as its parameter.Some servers may offer more challenges than you were expecting, but you'd stilllike to notice the one you care about.Usage-----It's really easy::   import www_authenticate   parsed = www_authenticate.parse(response.headers['WWW-Authenticate'])   if 'Basic' in parsed:       realm = parsed['Basic']['realm']   if 'Negotiate' in parsed:       challenge = parsed['Negotiate']The returned object is a ``collections.OrderedDict`` with authentication schemenames as keys. The values are either dictionaries, a single string, or ``None``if there are no parameters.Installation------------This package is in PyPI. Install with::   $ pip install www-authenticateThere are no external dependencies.</longdescription>
