	<longdescription>TensorFlow plugin for NVIDIA DALI=================================The TensorFlow plugin enables usage of DALI with TensorFlow.The NVIDIA Data Loading Library (DALI) is a library for data loading andpre-processing to accelerate deep learning applications. It provides acollection of highly optimized building blocks for loading and processingimage, video and audio data. It can be used as a portable drop-in replacementfor built in data loaders and data iterators in popular deep learning frameworks.Deep learning applications require complex, multi-stage data processing pipelinesthat include loading, decoding, cropping, resizing, and many other augmentations.These data processing pipelines, which are currently executed on the CPU, have become abottleneck, limiting the performance and scalability of training and inference.DALI addresses the problem of the CPU bottleneck by offloading data preprocessing to theGPU. Additionally, DALI relies on its own execution engine, built to maximize the throughputof the input pipeline. Features such as prefetching, parallel execution, and batch processingare handled transparently for the user.In addition, the deep learning frameworks have multiple data pre-processing implementations,resulting in challenges such as portability of training and inference workflows, and codemaintainability. Data processing pipelines implemented using DALI are portable because theycan easily be retargeted to TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet and PaddlePaddle.For more details please check the |release-doc|_... image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/DALI/main/dali.png    :width: 800    :align: center    :alt: DALI Diagram.. |release-doc| replace:: latest DALI Documentation.. _release-doc: https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dali/user-guide/docs/index.html</longdescription>
