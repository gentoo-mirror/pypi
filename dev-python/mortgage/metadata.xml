It also can help you easily compare between different mortgages.Begin by importing the loan class```pythonfrom mortgage import Loan```Create a simple mortgage```pythonfrom mortgage import Loanloan = Loan(principal=200000, interest=.06, term=30)```View a summary of pertinent mortgage information by calling the summarize property.```pythonfrom mortgage import Loanloan = Loan(principal=200000, interest=.06, term=30)loan.summarize&gt;&gt;&gt; Original Balance:         $    200,000&gt;&gt;&gt; Interest Rate:                    0.06 %&gt;&gt;&gt; APY:                              6.17 %&gt;&gt;&gt; APR:                              6.00 %&gt;&gt;&gt; Term:                               30 years&gt;&gt;&gt; Monthly Payment:          $    1199.10&gt;&gt;&gt; Total principal payments: $ 200,000.00&gt;&gt;&gt; Total interest payments:  $ 231,676.38&gt;&gt;&gt; Total payments:           $ 431,676.38&gt;&gt;&gt; Interest to principal:           115.8 %&gt;&gt;&gt; Years to pay:                     30.0```Particularly telling is the Interest to Principal ratio. With the mortgage terms above, you will pay **115%** of the original balance in interest! Compare that to the same loan with a 15 year term below```pythonfrom mortgage import Loanloan = Loan(principal=200000, interest=.06, term=15)loan.summarize&gt;&gt;&gt; Original Balance:         $    200,000&gt;&gt;&gt; Interest Rate:                    0.06 %&gt;&gt;&gt; APY:                              6.17 %&gt;&gt;&gt; APR:                              6.00 %&gt;&gt;&gt; Term:                               15 years&gt;&gt;&gt; Monthly Payment:          $    1687.71&gt;&gt;&gt; Total principal payments: $ 200,000.00&gt;&gt;&gt; Total interest payments:  $ 103,788.46&gt;&gt;&gt; Total payments:           $ 303,788.46&gt;&gt;&gt; Interest to principal:            51.9 %&gt;&gt;&gt; Years to pay:                     15.0```In this case, you only pay **52%** of the original loan balance in interest. Obviously, the shorter the term with all else equal, the less interest you'll pay. But it helps to know exactly how much more/less you'll pay.Run The Test Cases--------------------From the top level directory, run the following command:```pytest```Thank You--------------------Thanks for checking out the package! I hope you find it useful.Feel free to open an issue with suggestions, imporovements, ideas, etc.</longdescription>
