Change things from this point onPuppet building rules for OpenStack images==========================================These elements are used to build disk images for deploying OpenStack via Heat.They are built as part of the TripleO_ umbrella project... _TripleO: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleOInstructions------------Checkout this source tree and also the diskimage builder, export anELEMENTS_PATH to add elements from this tree, and build any disk images youneed::    git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/diskimage-builder.git    git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/tripleo-puppet-elements.git    export ELEMENTS_PATH=tripleo-puppet-elements/elements    diskimage-builder/bin/disk-image-create -u base vm bootstrap local-config stackuser heat-cfntools -a i386 -o bootstrapCommon element combinations---------------------------Always include heat-cfntools in images that you intend to boot via heat : ifthat is not done, then the user ssh keys are not reliably pulled down from themetadata server due to interactions with cloud-init.Architecture------------OpenStack images are intended to be deployed and maintained using Nova + Heat.As such they should strive to be stateless, maintained entirely via automation.Configuration-------------In a running OpenStack there are several categories of config. - per user - e.g. ssh key registration with nova: we repeat this sort   of config every time we add a user. - local node - e.g. nova.conf or ovs-vsctl add-br br-ex : settings that   apply individually to machines - inter-node - e.g. credentials on rabbitmq for a given nova compute node - application state - e.g. 'neutron net-create ...' : settings that   apply to the whole cluster not on a per-user / per-tenant basisWe have five places we can do configuration in TripleO: - image build time - in-instance heat-driven (ORC scripts) - in-instance first-boot scripts [deprecated] - from outside via APIs - orchestrated by HeatOur current heuristic for deciding where to do any particular configurationstep: - per user config should be done from the outside via APIs, even for   users like 'admin' that we know we'll have. Note that service accounts   are different - they are a form of inter-node configuration. - local node configuration should be done via ORC driven by Heat and/or   configuration management system metadata. - inter-node configuration should be done by working through Heat. For   instance, creating a rabbit account for a nova compute node is something   that Heat should arrange, though the act of creating is probably done by a   script on the rabbit server - triggered by Heat - and applying the config is   done on the compute node by the local node script - again triggered by Heat. - application state changes should be done from outside via APIs - first-boot scripts should not be used.Copyright=========Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;); you maynot use this file except in compliance with the License.
