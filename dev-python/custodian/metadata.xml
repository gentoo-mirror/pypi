	<longdescription>   :width: 400px   :alt: CustodianCustodian is a simple, robust and flexible just-in-time (JIT) job managementframework written in Python. Using custodian, you can create wrappers thatperform error checking, job management and error recovery. It has a simpleplugin framework that allows you to develop specific job management workflowsfor different applications.Error recovery is an important aspect of many *high-throughput* projects thatgenerate data on a large scale. When you are running on the order of hundredsof thousands of jobs, even an error-rate of 1% would mean thousands of erroredjobs that would be impossible to deal with on a case-by-case basis.The specific use case for custodian is for long running jobs, with potentiallyrandom errors. For example, there may be a script that takes several days torun on a server, with a 1% chance of some IO error causing the job to fail.Using custodian, one can develop a mechanism to gracefully recover from theerror, and restart the job with modified parameters if necessary.The current version of Custodian also comes with several sub-packages for errorhandling for Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP), NwChem, QChem, FEFF, Lobster and CP2Kcalculations.Getting custodian=================Stable version--------------The version at the Python Package Index (PyPI) is always the latest stablerelease that will be hopefully, be relatively bug-free. Install as follows::    pip install custodianSome plugins (e.g., vasp management) require additional setup (please see`pymatgen's documentation &lt;http://pymatgen.org/&gt;`_).Developmental version---------------------The bleeding edge developmental version is at the custodian's `Github repo&lt;https://github.com/materialsproject/custodian&gt;`_. The developmentalversion is likely to be more buggy, but may contain new features. TheGithub version include test files as well for complete unit testing. Aftercloning the source, you can type::    python setup.py installor to install the package in developmental mode::    python setup.py developRequirements============Custodian supports Python 3.8+. There are no other required dependencies.However, if you wish to use many of the built-in error handlers and Jobs forVASP, NWChem, QChem, etc., you will likely need pymatgen to be install as well.Usage=====Please refer to the `official custodian docs&lt;http://pythonhosted.org//custodian&gt;`_ for details on how to usecustodian.How to cite custodian=====================If you use custodian in your research, especially the VASP component, pleaseconsider citing the following work:    Shyue Ping Ong, William Davidson Richards, Anubhav Jain, Geoffroy Hautier,    Michael Kocher, Shreyas Cholia, Dan Gunter, Vincent Chevrier, Kristin A.
