The FASTA parser is not as optimizedLinks=====* `Documentation &lt;https://dnaio.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_* `Source code &lt;https://github.com/marcelm/dnaio/&gt;`_* `Report an issue &lt;https://github.com/marcelm/dnaio/issues&gt;`_* `Project page on PyPI &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dnaio/&gt;`_</longdescription>
