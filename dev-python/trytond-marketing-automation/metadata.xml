	<longdescription>Marketing Automation Module###########################The marketing_automation module allows marketing actions to be automated. It isbased on scenarios and activities that are executed on selected records.Scenario********A scenario provides the entry point for records into an automated marketingcampaign. Each record can only enter a scenario once. A scenario is defined by:    * Name    * Model: the type of record for the scenario (by default Party and Sale)    * Domain: used to filter records    * State:        * Draft        * Running        * StoppedA cron task runs periodically to find new records to apply the scenario to.Activity********The activities form a scenario. They define which action should be triggeredand when it should happen. The activities are organized as a tree and definedby:    * Name    * Parent    * Children    * On: event from the parent that triggers the activity:        * E-Mail Opened        * E-Mail Not Opened        * E-Mail Clicked        * E-Mail Not Clicked    * Condition: that the record must match to execute the activity    * Delay: before the action is executed    * Action: list of available actionsActions-------Send E-Mail...........The activity send an e-mail to the party defined on the record.The E-mail is composed using an HTML `Genshi &lt;https://genshi.edgewall.org/&gt;`_template with ``record`` in the evaluation context.All ``&lt;a&gt;`` elements have their ``href`` replaced by a shortened version usedto trigger children activities. If the ``href`` value is ``unsubscribe``, it isreplaced by the URL which allows the recipient to block their record for thescenario.A empty image is automatically added at the end of the ``&lt;body&gt;`` to track whenemails are opened.Record******It stores a reference to the records included in each scenario. If the recordis blocked, no activity will be triggered for the record.Record Activity***************It stores the state of a record for an activity of the scenario.A cron task runs periodically to execute any waiting record activity that isdue.Configuration*************The marketing_automation module uses parameters from the section:- ``[marketing]``:    - ``email_from``: The default ``From`` for the email.    - ``automation_base``: The base URL without a path for the unsubscribe URL      and the empty image.
