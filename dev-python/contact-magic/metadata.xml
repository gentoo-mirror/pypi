	<longdescription># ðŸ§™ ContactMagic## What is ContactMagic?**ContactMagic** is a wrapper around [Copyfactory](https://copyfactory.io/) and[SalesScrapers](https://salesscrapers.dev/) to build programmatic workflows that enrich contact dataand create personalized and engaging messaging.With ContactMagic, you can programmatically:- Enrich people and companies with hard to find datapoints such as case studies, news announcements and more.- Build your own custom scrapers in a few lines of code *(Soon)*- Bulk personalize and enrich data with as many datapoints as you need.- Create custom personalization templates.- Manage and run personalization workflows for clients at scale (contact [eric@copyfactory.io](eric@copyfactory.io) to learn more)## Before you installContactMagic was designed with concurrency in mind. All operations make use of Asyncio to accelerate the process. Youcan set the number of concurrent workers in the settings.Before installing, you should also ensure that you have a registered account with [Copyfactory](https://copyfactory.io/)and [SalesScrapers](https://salesscrapers.dev/) as API keys for both services is required.## Rate limit and error handlingThere is no need for you to handle rate limits (`429` HTTP status error). The library handles rate limits automatically.## ConfigurationA 'SETTINGS' variable is exposed from the `settings.py` file which reads from your environment to set API key values.Here are the current settings you should have in your .env file or environment.```pythonCOPYFACTORY_API_KEY=''SALES_SCRAPERS_API_KEY=''MASTERSHEET_URL=''GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=''GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=''GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=''GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=''GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=''TIMEZONE=&quot;America/New_York&quot;# list and dict are parsed as JSON.ALLOWED_SCRAPER_NAMES='[&quot;get-case-study&quot;, &quot;get-company-achievement&quot;, &quot;get-company-description&quot;, &quot;get-company-announcement&quot;, &quot;FALLBACK&quot;, &quot;search-google&quot;]'MAX_WORKERS='5'  # Number of concurrent workers to process. 5-10 is likely enough.```If you are not using the agency workflows and just want to use the underlying PersonalizationSetttings objects you onlyneed to set the following environment variables.```pythonCOPYFACTORY_API_KEY=''SALES_SCRAPERS_API_KEY=''# Optional since has default valueALLOWED_SCRAPER_NAMES='[&quot;get-case-study&quot;, &quot;get-company-achievement&quot;, &quot;get-company-description&quot;, &quot;get-company-announcement&quot;, &quot;FALLBACK&quot;, &quot;search-google&quot;]'# Optional since has default valueMAX_WORKERS='5'```## Usage &amp; ExamplesThe core underlying model you will be using is 'PersonalizationSettings' which is responsible for understanding whatyou want to scrape and how you want to personalize.```pythonfrom contact_magic import PersonalizationSettingsimport pandas as pddata = [    {        # name this column anything you want        &quot;col_name&quot;: &quot;personalized_field1&quot;,        # If the first scraper returns nothing, will iterate through list until a successful scrape is complete.        &quot;allowed_scrapers&quot;: [            {                &quot;scraper_name&quot;: &quot;get-case-study&quot;,  # endpoint for SalesScrapers                &quot;premise_url&quot;: &quot;https://app.copyfactory.io/profiles/1065/premises/7478/&quot;  # Copyfactory premise url            },            {                &quot;scraper_name&quot;: &quot;another-scraper&quot;,                &quot;premise_url&quot;: &quot;https://app.copyfactory.io/profiles/1065/premises/7478/&quot;            }        ],    }, ...]# Set the datapoints. Notice how it's a list? This means you can generate as many personalized sentences as you want.settings = PersonalizationSettings(datapoints=data)dataframe = pd.read_csv(&quot;my_csv_file.csv&quot;)# Run the settings against the DataFramepersonalized_dataframe = settings.process_from_dataframe(dataframe)```What happens when we run `process_from_dataframe`?1. The dataframe is extended with new columns. For each 'col_name' in the list of datapoints you provided a new   column with the name you set for 'col_name' and another one for the source which is 'source__{col_name_value}' is added.    - In our example above, the columns created would be 'personalized_field1' and 'source__personalized_field1'.2. For each datapoint, the list of 'allowed_scrapers' is iterated on and SalesScraper tries to find the data, if it does   it sends the scraped data to Copyfactory to generate a personalized sentence.3. The source from SalesScrapers is set for that datapoints source column, and the personalized sentence is set on the   datapoints column name.</longdescription>
