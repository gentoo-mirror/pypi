If using `-n` argument to launch a new window, then window specific profile settings will be applied                                                                                    || `tabs`     | Windows or tabs in the iTerm window.                                                                                                                                                                                                             || `window-1` | Replace with the unique project id e.g. `web-catalog-pim`                                                                                                                                                                                        || `root`     | Root path for all panes within a tab                                                                                                                                                                                                             || `title`    | Title to be shown in the title bar of the current tab                                                                                                                                                                                            || `badge`    | Set the Badge Text of the pane                                                                                                                                                                                                                   || `position` | Position of the pane in the window. It has the format of `number1/number2` where `number1` refers to the column and `number2` refers to the row in the column. More on this later in the readme. `position` is the only required key in a pane   || `focus`    | Pane to be in focus when itomate is finished. `focus: true`. There should only be one focus flag per Tab. If multiple are found, it will focus on the last pane evaluated.                                                                       || `commands` | List of commands to execute in the current pane.                                                                                                                                                                                                 || `prompt`   | A command which will remain populated in the prompt after all `command`s have finished executing.

This allows itomate files to be safely committed to version control. Note in the above configuration example the line using the environment variable is prefixed with the  `!ENV` tag and then uses one or more Environment Variableswrapped in the `${ }` syntax.## LayoutsThe parameter `position` in each pane decides where each of the window panes will be displayed. The position value has the format below```shellx / y â€“ both x and y are required parametersx: refers to the column in the windowy: refers to the row of the given column x```Here are some of the examples for different pane layouts## Single Pane WindowFor single pane, since there is one column and one row, the position for pane would be `1/1````.------------------.| 1/1              ||                  ||                  ||                  ||                  ||                  ||                  ||                  ||                  |'------------------'```Here is how the configuration would look like```ymlversion: &quot;1.0&quot;tabs:  some-project:    title: &quot;Some Project&quot;    panes:      - title: &quot;Single Pane&quot;        position: &quot;1/1&quot;        commands:          - &quot;cd ~/Workspace/some-project&quot;          - &quot;git pull origin master&quot;          - &quot;yarn dev&quot;```## Two Panes Vertical Split LayoutFor two panes with equal split or in other words two columns with one row in each, the positions would be `1/1` for the pane on the left and `2/1` for the pane on the right i.e. the second column.```.------------------.------------------.| 1/1              | 2/1              ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  |'------------------'------------------'```Here is how it would look in the configuration```ymlversion: &quot;1.0&quot;tabs:  some-project:    root: &quot;~/Workspace/some-project&quot;    title: &quot;Some Project&quot;    panes:      - title: &quot;First Half&quot;        position: &quot;1/1&quot;    # &lt;-- Notice the position      - title: &quot;Second Half&quot;        position: &quot;2/1&quot;    # &lt;-- Notice the position```## Two Columns, Three Panes LayoutThe layout below now has two columns. First column has only one row so position for that would be `1/1`. For the second column we have two panes i.e. two rows; first pane in the second column would be `2/1` and the second one would be `2/2`.```.------------------.------------------.| 1/1              | 2/1              ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |------------------||                  | 2/2              ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  |'------------------'------------------'```Configuration for that would be:```ymlversion: &quot;1.0&quot;tabs:  some-project:    root: &quot;~/Workspace/dev-server&quot;    title: &quot;Some Project&quot;    panes:      - position: &quot;1/1&quot;    # &lt;-- Notice the position      - position: &quot;2/1&quot;    # &lt;-- Notice the position        commands:          - &quot;./run&quot;      - position: &quot;2/2&quot;    # &lt;-- Notice the position        commands:          - &quot;git standup&quot;```Note that the `commands` and `title` are optional parameters in panes. Only `position` is required.## Two Columns, Four Panes Layout```.------------------.------------------.| 1/1              | 2/1              ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||------------------|                  || 1/2              |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||------------------|                  || 1/3              |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  |'------------------'------------------'```Configuration for that would be:```ymlversion: &quot;1.0&quot;tabs:  some-project:    root: &quot;~/Workspace/project&quot;    title: &quot;Some Project&quot;    panes:      - position: &quot;1/1&quot;    # &lt;-- Notice the position        commands:          - &quot;Make clean&quot;      - position: &quot;1/2&quot;    # &lt;-- Notice the position        commands:          - &quot;git standup&quot;      - position: &quot;1/3&quot;    # &lt;-- Notice the position        commands:          - &quot;git standup&quot;      - position: &quot;2/1&quot;    # &lt;-- Notice the position        commands:          - &quot;./run&quot;```## Three Columns Five Pane Layout```.------------------.------------------.------------------.| 1/1              | 2/1              | 3/1              ||                  |                  |                  ||                  |                  |                  ||                  |                  |                  ||                  |------------------|                  ||                  | 2/2              |                  ||                  |                  |                  ||                  |                  |                  ||                  |------------------|                  ||                  | 2/3              |                  ||                  |                  |                  ||                  |                  |                  |'------------------'------------------'------------------'```Configuration for that would be```ymlversion: &quot;1.0&quot;tabs:  some-project:    title: &quot;Some Project&quot;    panes:      - position: &quot;1/1&quot;    # &lt;-- Notice the position      - position: &quot;2/1&quot;    # &lt;-- Notice the position      - position: &quot;2/2&quot;    # &lt;-- Notice the position      - position: &quot;2/3&quot;    # &lt;-- Notice the position      - position: &quot;3/1&quot;    # &lt;-- Notice the position```## ContributorsSpecial thanks to the contributors for making iTomate possible* [@zakiuu](https://github.com/zakiuu)* [@JohnLegrandRichards](https://github.com/JohnLegrandRichards)* [@zachvalenta](https://github.com/zachvalenta)* [@PSalant726](https://github.com/psalant726)* You?## Similar ProjectsThere is [itermocil](https://github.com/TomAnthony/itermocil/blob/master/README.md) which relies on [Applescript that has been deprecated by iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-scripting.html), has limited layout options, and is pretty limited in terms of what it can achieve because of AppleScript. iTomate on the other hand uses iTerm's [newly introduced Python API](https://www.iterm2.com/python-api/), has flexible layouts support and can be extended using iTerm's pretty powerful API.## ContributionsFeel free to submit pull requests, create issues, spread the word.## LicenseMIT &amp;copy; [Kamran Ahmed](https://twitter.com/kamranahmedse)</longdescription>
