	<longdescription>====================Utilities for Python====================This is a Python &quot;util&quot; submodule with code that I habitually use in somany projects that I decided to split it off into its own git archive.This code is not a Python module. The idea is to add it as a submodule toyour own Python code::   git submodule add git@github.com:smurfix/util-py.git src/your_module/util and then relative-import::   from .util import attrdictFeel free to extend and embrace. Patches welcome.Features========A few. Read the code, I didn't get around to documenting all of that yet.times+++++This code implements calculating an offset to an under-specified futuretime. Like &quot;how long until next Wednesday 8 am&quot;?The code also supports the inverse question, as in &quot;how long until it's nolonger Wednesday 8 am&quot;.License=======No restrictions. CC0 / public domain / MIT / GPLv3 / whatever, as long asyou don't want anybody (i.e. the author(s)) to pay for the effects of anybugs, features or &quot;features&quot; which this code might or might not have.Please contribute any enhancements.Dependencies============A few. Notable:* anyio, version 3. Required for `ValueEvent`, `spawn` (obviously) and  `as_service`.* ruyaml. This is a fork of ruamel.yaml which is a fork of pyyaml.  Fixes some bugs and has a more reasonable API. Required for  `yload`/`yprint`/`yformat`.* msgpack, obviously required for `pack`/`unpack` and `MsgReader`/`MsgWriter`.* asyncclick, required for `main_`/`wrap_main`.</longdescription>
