This library differs by using a normal Facebook account instead.``fbchat`` currently support:- Sending many types of messages, with files, stickers, mentions, etc.- Fetching all messages, threads and images in threads.- Searching for messages and threads.- Creating groups, setting the group emoji, changing nicknames, creating polls, etc.- Listening for, an reacting to messages and other events in real-time.- Type hints, and it has a modern codebase (e.g. only Python 3.5 and upwards).- ``async``/``await`` (COMING).Essentially, everything you need to make an amazing Facebook bot!Caveats-------``fbchat`` works by imitating what the browser does, and thereby tricking Facebook into thinking it's accessing the website normally.However, there's a catch! **Using this library may not comply with Facebook's Terms Of Service!**, so be responsible Facebook citizens! We are not responsible if your account gets banned!Additionally, **the APIs the library is calling is undocumented!** In theory, this means that your code could break tomorrow, without the slightest warning!If this happens to you, please report it, so that we can fix it as soon as possible!.. inclusion-marker-intro-end..
