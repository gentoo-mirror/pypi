The `medspacy` package brings together a number of other packages, each of which implements specific functionality for common clinical text processing specific to the clinical domain, such as sentence segmentation, contextual analysis and attribute assertion, and section detection.`medspacy` is modularized so that each component can be used independently. All of `medspacy` is designed to be used as part of a `spacy` processing pipeline. Each of the following modules is available as part of `medspacy`:- `medspacy.preprocess`: Destructive preprocessing for modifying clinical text before processing- `medspacy.sentence_splitter`: Clinical sentence segmentation- `medspacy.ner`: Utilities for extracting concepts from clinical text- `medspacy.context`: Implementation of the [ConText](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046409000744)for detecting semantic modifiers and attributes of entities, including negation and uncertainty- `medspacy.section_detection`: Clinical section detection and segmentation- `medspacy.postprocess`: Flexible framework for modifying and removing extracted entities- `medspacy.io`: Utilities for converting processed texts to structured data and interacting with databases- `medspacy.visualization`: Utilities for visualizing concepts and relationships extracted from text- `SpacyQuickUMLS`: UMLS concept extraction compatible with spacy and medspacy implemented by [QuickUMLS](https://github.com/Georgetown-IR-Lab/QuickUMLS).  More detail on this component, how to use it, how to generate UMLS resources beyond the small UMLS sample can be found in [this notebook](notebooks/11-QuickUMLS_Extraction.ipynb).- NOTE: This component is installed by default on MacOS and Linux but not Windows.  For more defails and Windows installation: [QuickUMLS on Windows](windows_and_quickumls.md)Future work could include I/O, relations extraction, and pre-trained clinical models.**As of 10/2/2021 (version 0.2.0.0), medspaCy supports spaCy v3**# Usage## InstallationYou can install `medspacy` using `setup.py`:```bashpython setup.py install```Or with pip:```bashpip install medspacy```To install a previous version which uses spaCy 2:```bashpip install medspacy==medspacy 0.1.0.2```### RequirementsThe following packages are required and installed when `medspacy` is installed:- spaCy v3- [pyrush](https://github.com/medspacy/PyRuSH)If you download other models, you can use them by providing the model itself or model name to `medspacy.load(model_name)`:```pythonimport spacy; import medspacy# Option 1: Load defaultnlp = medspacy.load()# Option 2: Load from existing modelnlp = spacy.load(&quot;en_core_web_sm&quot;, disable={&quot;ner&quot;})nlp = medspacy.load(nlp)# Option 3: Load from model namenlp = medspacy.load(&quot;en_core_web_sm&quot;, disable={&quot;ner&quot;})```    ## Basic UsageHere is a simple example showing how to implement and visualize a simple rule-based pipeline using `medspacy`:```pythonimport medspacyfrom medspacy.ner import TargetRulefrom medspacy.visualization import visualize_ent# Load medspacy modelnlp = medspacy.load()print(nlp.pipe_names)text = &quot;&quot;&quot;Past Medical History:1. Atrial fibrillation2. Type II Diabetes MellitusAssessment and Plan:There is no evidence of pneumonia. Continue warfarin for Afib.
