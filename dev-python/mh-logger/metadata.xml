	<longdescription># Moonhub LoggerThe `mh_logger` handles logging into GCP and locally in a seamless manner.## Installation```python3 -m pip install mh_logger```## User guide### Basic logA basic log is composed of a message and kwargs to be logged.```from mh_logger import LoggingManagerlogger = LoggingManager(__name__)logger.info(&quot;This is a sample log&quot;, foo=&quot;bar&quot;)```Output:```2023-03-16 20:22:36,561 [INFO] - Test: This is a sample log - JSON Payload: {    'foo': 'bar',    &quot;_message&quot;: &quot;This is a sample log&quot;,    &quot;request_id&quot;: &quot;b30cb564210a4172b00d273ad441f9e2&quot;}```### Binded variablesBinded variables are variables preserved across different modules and functions within the same thread (from the `threading` module) or within the same Task (from the `asyncio` module). Example:```logger.bind(foo=&quot;bar&quot;, hello=&quot;world&quot;)def a():    logger.info(&quot;My first log&quot;)def b():    logger.info(&quot;My second log&quot;)a()b()```Output:```2023-03-16 20:22:36,561 [INFO] - Test: My first log - JSON Payload: {    &quot;foo&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;,    &quot;hello&quot;: &quot;world&quot;,    &quot;_message&quot;: &quot;My first log&quot;,    &quot;request_id&quot;: &quot;b30cb564210a4172b00d273ad441f9e2&quot;}2023-03-16 20:22:37,561 [INFO] - Test: My second log - JSON Payload: {    &quot;foo&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;,    &quot;hello&quot;: &quot;world&quot;,    &quot;_message&quot;: &quot;My second log&quot;,    &quot;request_id&quot;: &quot;b30cb564210a4172b00d273ad441f9e2&quot;}```### The `request_id`The `request_id` or `logger_id` is a special binded variable added by default to all logs.### Multi threadingWe must explicitly propagate the binded variables (including the `request_id`) to other threads. Example:```logger.info(&quot;Log on the main thread&quot;)with ThreadPoolExecutor(    initializer=logger.bind, initargs=(logger.binded,)) as executor:    executor.submit(logger.info, &quot;Log on a different thread&quot;)```Output:```2023-03-16 20:22:36,561 [INFO] - Test: Log on the main thread - JSON Payload: {    &quot;_message&quot;: &quot;Log on the main thread&quot;,    &quot;request_id&quot;: &quot;b30cb564210a4172b00d273ad441f9e2&quot;}2023-03-16 20:22:37,561 [INFO] - Test: Log on a different thread - JSON Payload: {    &quot;_message&quot;: &quot;Log on a different thread&quot;,    &quot;request_id&quot;: &quot;b30cb564210a4172b00d273ad441f9e2&quot;}```## Contribute to the Moonhub LoggerSet following environment variable if you want to push logs to GCP Cloud Logging service while testing locally.```GCP_SERVICE_KEY=google-service-key.json```## Deploy to pypihttps://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#generating-distribution-archivesYou will need to add `--skip-existing`.MIT LicenseCopyright (c) [year] [fullname]Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
