	<longdescription># ErutilsThe Erutils package includes a collection of utilities and pre-built neural networks that I frequently use in mypersonal projects. While this package is mainly for my personal use, others may find it useful as well.# InstallationYou can install Erutils using pip:```shellpip install erutils````Open [erfan zare Github](https://github.com/erfanzar/)Open [Package Github](https://github.com/erfanzar/Erutils)## ðŸš€ APIs and Usages```pythonimport erutilsfrom erutils.loggers import *# Loggers contain Logging stufffrom erutils.nn import *# NN contain Nural networks built in Pytorch# you can easily import erutils.nn and use many prebuilt neurons in the project # if you thing any refrence should be added tell me in discussion from erutils.lightning import *# Lightning Contain Some CV Packagesfrom erutils.utils import *# Utils Contain Some Utils like reading files downloading and etc ...```# Neural NetworksErutils includes a diverse collection of over 80 pre-built neural networks that cover a wide range of applications, suchas natural language processing, computer vision, and more. Some of the neural networks included are:- Transformers: Customized transformer encoder and decoder layers for natural language processing tasks and a lot of  customized Layers like RoEmbedding ...- Feed-forward networks: Customized feed-forward layers for various applications- Custom CNN backbones: A variety of pre-built CNN backbones for computer vision tasks, such as ResNet, VGG, and more- Object Detection: Pre-built networks for object detection and localization, including YOLOv5, RetinaNet, and Faster  R-CNN- Custom CNN architectures: Custom CNN architectures designed for specific applications, such as image classification,  segmentation, and more.## ðŸš€ About MeHi there ðŸ‘‹I like to train deep neural nets on large datasets ðŸ§ .Among other things in this world:)## License[MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)# ContributingWhile this package is mainly for my personal use, contributions and suggestions are welcome.
