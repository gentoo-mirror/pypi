See urls.example.py for a setup example. ### AuthenticationThe app provides most services without authentication. Authentication is required to store custom conversion rates and custom conversion units.By default, the app is configured to allow authentication through an API token that can be generated for a user on the Django admin site.API authentication can be achieved with an Authorization header header with value Token &lt;APIToken&gt;curl -H &quot;Authorization: Token &lt;user token&gt;&quot;.### Language supportThe app supports translations for countries and units in 15 languages. More languages should be available soon.### Fetch ratesThe app uses python-forex as a mecanism to fetch currency rates. A django command is available to fetch rates from command line :$ ./manage.py fetch_rates## About ### Project goalsWeb based services to convert units and currencies.
