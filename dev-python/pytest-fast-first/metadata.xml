	<longdescription># pytest fast firstWhen applying TDD, a key to successful, fast development is quick feedback. Thisplugin tries to shorten the time to feedback by ordering fast tests before slowerones.It measures the runtime of your tests and on subsequent sessions orders faster testsbefore slower ones. ## Installation```bashpip install pytest-fast-first```## Options* `--ff-inverse`: Inverts the order (can be used to optimize the runtime of a test  suite when run with xdist)* `--ff-group-by-module`: By default tests are just ordered by their runtime. If   you have module-scoped fixtures, this can help with better fixture reuse.* `--ff-filepath: Use the given filepath to store/read results. Default: .pytest-runtimes## State fileThe plugin creates the file `.pytest-runtimes` in which it stores the runtimesin JSON format. If you want runtime-based ordering in CI builds, you can checkit in to your version control system (you will have to live with mergeconflicts though).## License: [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)Copyright 2021 Martin Vielsmaier &amp; ContributorsPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy ofthis software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal inthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights touse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copiesof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to doso, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
