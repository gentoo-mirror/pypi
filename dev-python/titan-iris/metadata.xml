With this command, you can easily download the specified model to your local file system. Once the download is complete, the Iris pull command automatically generates a Docker container that includes both the __Triton__ server image and the __Hephaestus__ code. This provides a seamless, ready-to-go solution that makes it straightforward for users to use and deploy models with minimal effort.```iris pull &lt;experiment_id&gt;:&lt;job_tag&gt;```- &lt;experiment_id&gt;: the UUID assigned to each experiment.- &lt;job_tag&gt; the job tag the user would like to download.job_tag examples: - M- S- XS- baseline__demo:__Assume we have an experiment with an experiment_id &quot;_4_&quot; that has already been completed and stored in our database. We start by running the following command:```iris pull 4:XS ``` Once the command has executed successfully, a new Docker image will be created and saved on the user's machine. You can verify its existence by running:```docker images ```Now that the Docker image is ready, we can start the Docker container using the following command:```docker run -it iris-triton-4:XS```After the container starts, you should see the following output. Congratulations! You now have a ready-to-deploy Docker container.```root@dec4c93611a0:/usr/local/triton# lsREADME.md  VERSION  build  models  requirements.txt  run.sh  setup.py  src```## HelpAny advise for common problems or issues.```command to run if program contains helper info```## AuthorsContributors names and contact infoex.
