	<longdescription>## Torchlite![](./docs/sources/img/logo.png)[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/torchlite.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/torchlite)Torchlite is a high level library on top of popular machine learning frameworks such assklearn, Pytorch and Tensorflow.It gives a high layer abstraction of repetitive code used in machine learning for day-to-day data science tasks.## Installation```pip install torchlite```or if you want to run this lib directly to have access to the examples clone this repository and run:```pip install -r requirements.txt```to install the required dependencies.By default **Pytorch 0.4.0+** and **Tensorflow-GPU 1.8.0+** are installed along with this library but it's recommendedto install them from source from [here](http://pytorch.org/) if you want to use the `torchlite.torch`package and/or head over to the [Tensorflow install page](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) if you want touse the `torchlite.tf` package.## DocumentationFor now the library has no complete documentation but you can quickly get to know howit works by looking at the examples in the `examples-*` folders. This library is still inalpha and few APIs may change in the future. The only things which will evolve at the samepace as the library are the examples, they are meant to always be up to date withthe library.Few examples will generates folders/files such as saved models or tensorboard logs.To visualize the tensorboard logs download Tensorflow's tensorboard as well as [Pytorch's tensorboard](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboard-pytorch) if you're interested bythe `torchlite.torch` package. Then execute:```tensorboard --logdir=./tensorboard```## Packaging the project for Pypi deploy```pip install twinepip install wheelpython setup.py sdistpython setup.py bdist_wheel```[Create a pypi account](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#id76) and create `$HOME/.pypirc` with:```[pypi]username = &lt;username&gt;password = &lt;password&gt;```Then upload the packages with:```twine upload dist/*```Or just:```pypi_deploy.sh```</longdescription>
