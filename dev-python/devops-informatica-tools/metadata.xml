	<longdescription># CI-CD Pipeline, Provisioning and Maintenance components for Informatica projects## Dependencies* Crypto module for password encryption. Depending on the method you want to use, you need to install one of the following packages:  pip install pycryptodome  pip install cryptography* setuptools for upload and download of Nexus artifacts  pip install setuptools## Checks after installation### Check if encryption works* Create a virtualenv* Run:  python3 supporting/encryption.py  Output: Hello encrypted world!## LicenseMIT## Principles### deploy lists* All components expect a deploylist text file as input. You should keep deploylists in your source code Git. Suggested location:&lt;root&gt;/&lt;feature&gt;/config/&lt;deploylist&gt; where &lt;root&gt; is the base location within your Git, &lt;feature&gt; is your submodule (if any), and &lt;deploylist&gt; is the text file that contains the items to be deployed.  For example:  &lt;myGit&gt;/demo/config/oracle_deploylist.txt  &lt;myGit&gt;/demo/config/infa_deploylist.txt### environment variables* The python scripts use environment variables to determine locations, features and many other parameters. The environment variables that can or at times must be set can be found in:  * generalSettings: log directory, artifact directory, configuration directory and more  * infaSettings: deploy list location, Informatica source and target variables like INFA_HOME, location infacmd, connectivity to domain and Model Repository  * dbSettings: deploy list location, location of sql files, sqlprefix## ExamplesCheck the examples folder for more info on the structure of deploy lists.</longdescription>
