He works on Slack, Hipchat, Rocket.chat, and more - so you can build your bot without platform lock-in.He makes teaching your chat bot this simple:```python@respond_to(&quot;hi&quot;)def say_hello(self, message):    self.say(&quot;oh, hello!&quot;)```The first version of Will was built by [Steven Skoczen](http://stevenskoczen.com) while in the Greenkahuna Skunkworks (now defunct), was extended by [Ink and Feet](https://inkandfeet.com) and has been [contributed to by lots of awesome people](http://skoczen.github.io/will/improve/#the-shoulders-of-giants).Will has docs, including a quickstart and lots of screenshots at:**[http://skoczen.github.io/will/](http://skoczen.github.io/will)** If you've been using Will 0.x or 1.x, and are wondering how to upgrade to 2.x, [here's our friendly guide](http://skoczen.github.io/will/upgrading_to_2/). :) Check them out!</longdescription>
