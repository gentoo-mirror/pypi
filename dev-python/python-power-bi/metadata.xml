It aims to provide interactivevisualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enoughfor end users to create their own reports and dashboards. It is part of the MicrosoftPower Platform. This library allows you to use the Power BI Rest API from python. Alongwith providing the different endpoints, it will also handle the authentication processfor you.## Resources- [Power BI App Registration Portal](https://dev.powerbi.com/Apps)- [Power BI Rest API Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/)## Setup**Setup - Requirements Install:**For this particular project, you only need to install the dependencies, to use the project. The dependenciesare listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be installed by running the following command:```consolepip install -r requirements.txt```After running that command, the dependencies should be installed.**Setup - Local Install:**If you are planning to make modifications to this project or you would like to access itbefore it has been indexed on `PyPi`. I would recommend you either install this projectin `editable` mode or do a `local install`. For those of you, who want to make modificationsto this project. I would recommend you install the library in `editable` mode.If you want to install the library in `editable` mode, make sure to run the `setup.py`file, so you can install any dependencies you may need. To run the `setup.py` file,run the following command in your terminal.```consolepip install -e .```If you don't plan to make any modifications to the project but still want to use it acrossyour different projects, then do a local install.```consolepip install .```This will install all the dependencies listed in the `setup.py` file. Once doneyou can use the library wherever you want.**Setup - PyPi Install:**To **install** the library, run the following command from the terminal.```consolepip install python-power-bi```**Setup - PyPi Upgrade:**To **upgrade** the library, run the following command from the terminal.```consolepip install --upgrade python-power-bi```## UsageHere is a simple example of using the `powerbi` library.```pythonfrom pprint import pprintfrom configparser import ConfigParserfrom powerbi.client import PowerBiClient# Initialize the Parser.config = ConfigParser()# Read the file.config.read('config/config.ini')# Get the specified credentials.client_id = config.get('power_bi_api', 'client_id')redirect_uri = config.get('power_bi_api', 'redirect_uri')client_secret = config.get('power_bi_api', 'client_secret')# Initialize the Client.power_bi_client = PowerBiClient(    client_id=client_id,    client_secret=client_secret,    scope=['https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api/.default'],    redirect_uri=redirect_uri,    credentials='config/power_bi_state.jsonc')# Initialize the `Dashboards` service.dashboard_service = power_bi_client.dashboards()# Add a dashboard to our Workspace.dashboard_service.add_dashboard(name='my_new_dashboard')# Get all the dashboards in our Org.pprint(dashboard_service.get_dashboards())```## Support These Projects**Patreon:**Help support this project and future projects by donating to my [Patreon Page](https://www.patreon.com/sigmacoding). I'malways looking to add more content for individuals like yourself, unfortuantely some of the APIs I would require me topay monthly fees.**YouTube:**If you'd like to watch more of my content, feel free to visit my YouTube channel [Sigma Coding](https://www.youtube.com/c/SigmaCoding).**Questions:**If you have questions please feel free to reach out to me at [coding.sigma@gmail.com](mailto:coding.sigma@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Fred%20Library)</longdescription>
