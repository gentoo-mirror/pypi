	<longdescription># subprocess-teeThis package provides a drop-in alternative to `subprocess.run` thatcaptures the output while still printing it in **real-time**, just the way`tee` does.Printing output in real-time while still capturing is valuable forany tool that executes long-running child processes. For those, you do wantto provide instant feedback (progress) related to what is happening.```python# from subprocess import runfrom subprocess_tee import runresult = run(&quot;echo 123&quot;)result.stdout == &quot;123\n&quot;```You can add `tee=False` to disable the tee functionality if you want, thisbeing a much shorter alternative than adding the well known`stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL`.Keep in mind that `universal_newlines=True` is implied as we expect textprocessing, this being a divergence from the original `subprocess.run`.You can still use `check=True` in order to make it raise CompletedProcessexception when the result code is not zero.</longdescription>
