The performanceimprovements come from changes to the data conversion functions, cursor implementations,and a C extension that is highly optimized to improve row data reading.The package can be used both in a pure Python mode and as well as a C acceleratedmode. Generally speaking, the C accelerated version of the client can readdata 10X faster than PyMySQL, 2X faster than MySQLdb, and 1.5X faster thanmysql.connector. All of this is done without having to install any 3rd partyMySQL libraries!Benchmarking was done with a table of 3,533,286 rows each containing a datetime,a float, and eight character columns. The data is the same data set used in[this article](https://www.singlestore.com/blog/how-to-get-started-with-singlestore/).The client and server were running on the same machine and queries were madeusing `fetchone`, `fetchall`, `fetchmany(1000)`, and an iterator over the cursorobject (e.g., `iter(cur)`). The results are shown below.### Buffered|                         | PyMySQL | MySQLdb | mysql.connector | SingleStore (pure Python) | SingleStore ||-------------------------|---------|---------|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------|| fetchall                |   37.0s |    8.7s |            5.6s |                     29.0s |        3.7s || fetchmany(1000)         |   37.4s |    9.2s |            6.2s |                     29.6s |        3.6s || fetchone                |   38.2s |   10.1s |            10.2s |                     30.9s |        4.8s || iter(cur)               |   38.3s |    9.1s |            10.2s |                     30.4s |        4.4s |### Unbuffered|                         | PyMySQL | MySQLdb | mysql.connector | SingleStore (pure Python) | SingleStore ||-------------------------|---------|---------|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------|| fetchall                |   39.0s |    6.5s |            5.5s |                     30.3s |        5.5s || fetchmany(1000)         |   39.4s |    7.0s |            6.0s |                     30.4s |        4.1s || fetchone                |   34.5s |    8.9s |           10.1s |                     30.8s |        6.6s || iter(cur)               |   39.0s |    9.0s |           10.2s |                     31.4s |        6.0s |## LicenseThis library is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/singlestore-labs/singlestoredb-python/main/LICENSE?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABMGV6QPNR6N23BVICDYK5LAYTVK5EA).## Resources* [SingleStore](https://singlestore.com)* [Python](https://python.org)## User agreementSINGLESTORE, INC.
