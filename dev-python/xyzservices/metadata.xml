	<longdescription># xyzservices - Source of XYZ tiles providers`xyzservices` is a lightweight library providing a repository of available XYZ servicesoffering raster basemap tiles. The repository is provided via Python API and as acompressed JSON file.XYZ tiles can be used as background for your maps to provide necessary spatial context.`xyzservices` offer specifications of many tile services and provide an easy-to-usetools to plug them into your work, no matter if interactive or static.[![Tests](https://github.com/geopandas/xyzservices/actions/workflows/tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/geopandas/xyzservices/actions/workflows/tests.yaml) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/geopandas/xyzservices/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=PBSZQA48GY)](https://codecov.io/gh/geopandas/xyzservices)## Quick StartUsing `xyzservices` is simple and in most cases does not involve more than a line ofcode.### InstallationYou can install `xyzservices` from `conda` or `pip`:```shellconda install xyzservices -c conda-forge``````shellpip install xyzservices```The package does not depend on any other apart from those built-in in Python.### Providers APIThe key part of `xyzservices` are providers:```py&gt;&gt;&gt; import xyzservices.providers as xyz````xyzservices.providers` or just `xyz` for short is a `Bunch` of providers, an enhanced`dict`. If you are in Jupyter-like environment, `xyz` will offer collapsible inventoryof available XYZ tile sources. You can also explore it as a standard `dict` using`xyz.keys()`. Once you have picked your provider, you get its details as a`TileProvider` object with all the details you may need:```py&gt;&gt;&gt; xyz.CartoDB.Positron.url'https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/{variant}/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png'&gt;&gt;&gt; xyz.CartoDB.Positron.attribution'(C) OpenStreetMap contributors (C) CARTO'```You can also check if the `TileProvider` needs API token and pass it to the object ifneeded.```py&gt;&gt;&gt; xyz.MapBox.requires_token()True&gt;&gt;&gt; xyz.MapBox[&quot;accessToken&quot;] = &quot;my_personal_token&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt; xyz.MapBox.requires_token()False```### Providers JSONAfter the installation, you will find the JSON used as a database of providers in`share/xyzservices/providers.json` if you want to use it outside of a Python ecosystem.## Contributors`xyzservices` is developed by a community of enthusiastic volunteers and lives under[`geopandas`](https://github.com/geopandas) GitHub organization. You can see a full listof contributors [here](https://github.com/geopandas/xyzservices/graphs/contributors).The main group of providers is retrieved from the [`leaflet-providers`project](https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers) that contains both openlyaccessible providers as well as those requiring registration. All of them are considered[free](https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers/blob/master/README.md#what-do-we-mean-by-free).If you would like to contribute to the project, have a look at the list of[open issues](https://github.com/geopandas/contextily/issues), particularly those labeled as[good first issue](https://github.com/geopandas/xyzservices/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).## LicenseBSD 3-Clause LicenseResources coming from the [`leaflet-providers`project](https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers) are licensed under BSD2-Clause License (Â© 2013 Leaflet Providers)</longdescription>
