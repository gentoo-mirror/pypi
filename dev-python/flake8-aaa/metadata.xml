It's also known as &quot;AAA&quot; and &quot;3A&quot;.As the name suggests each test is broken down into three distinct partsseparated by blank lines:* **Arrange:** Set up the object to be tested.* **Act**: Carry out an action on the object.* **Assert**: Check the expected results have occurred.For example, a simple test on the behaviour of add ``+``:.. code-block:: python    def test() -&gt; None:       x = 1       y = 1       result = x + y       assert result == 2As you can see, the Act block starts with ``result =`` and is separated fromthe Arrange and Assert blocks by blank lines. The test is focused - it onlycontains one add operation and no further additions occur.Using AAA consistently makes it easier to find the Action in a test. It'stherefore always easy to see the object behaviour each test is focused on.Further reading:* `Arrange-Act-Assert: A Pattern for Writing Good Tests  &lt;https://automationpanda.com/2020/07/07/arrange-act-assert-a-pattern-for-writing-good-tests/&gt;`_  - a great introduction to AAA from a Python perspective.* `Anatomy of a test  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/explanation/anatomy.html&gt;`_ - a  description of Arrange Act Assert in the Pytest documentation.* `Arrange Act Assert pattern for Python developers  &lt;https://jamescooke.info/arrange-act-assert-pattern-for-python-developers.html&gt;`_  - information about the pattern and each part of a test.* `Our &quot;good&quot; example files  &lt;https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/tree/master/examples/good&gt;`_ -  test examples used in the Flake8-AAA test suite.What is Flake8?...............Flake8 is a command line utility for enforcing style consistency across Pythonprojects. It wraps multiple style checking tools and also runs third-partychecks provided by plugins, of which Flake8-AAA is one.Further reading:* `Flake8's documentation &lt;https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/&gt;`_.* `Awesome Flake8 Extensions  &lt;https://github.com/DmytroLitvinov/awesome-flake8-extensions/&gt;`_ - a curated  list of Flake8 plugins.What does Flake8-AAA do?........................Flake8-AAA extends Flake8 to check your Python tests match the AAA pattern.It does this by adding the following checks to Flake8:* Every test has a single clear Act block.* Every Act block is distinguished from the code around it with a blank line  above and below.* Arrange and Assert blocks do not contain additional blank lines.In the future, Flake8-AAA will check that no test has become too complicatedand that Arrange blocks do not contain assertions.Checking your code with these simple formatting rules helps you write simple,consistently formatted tests that match the AAA pattern. They are most helpfulif you call Flake8 regularly, for example when you save a file or before yourun a test suite.Further reading:* `Error codes documentation  &lt;https://flake8-aaa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/error_codes/all.html&gt;`_: A list  of error codes raised by Flake8-AAA when a test doesn't match the AAA  pattern.üèÅ Getting Started------------------Installation............Install ``flake8-aaa``:.. code-block:: shell    pip install flake8-aaaThis will install Flake8-AAA and its dependencies, which include Flake8.You can confirm that Flake8 recognises the plugin by checking its versionstring:.. code-block:: shell    flake8 --version.. code-block::    6.1.0 (flake8-aaa: 0.17.0, mccabe: 0.7.0, pycodestyle: 2.11.1, pyflakes: 3.1.0) CPython 3.11.6 on LinuxThe ``flake8-aaa: 0.17.0`` part tells you that Flake8-AAA was installedsuccessfully and its checks will be used by Flake8.Further reading:* `Flake8 installation instructions  &lt;https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html#installation-guide&gt;`_.First run.........Let's check the good example from above. We expect Flake8 to return no errors:.. code-block:: shell    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/master/examples/good/test_example.py &gt; test_example.py    flake8 test_example.pySilence - just what we wanted.Now let's see a failure from Flake8-AAA. We can use a bad example:.. code-block:: shell    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/master/examples/bad/test.py &gt; test.py    flake8 test.py.. code-block::    test.py:4:1: AAA01 no Act block found in testüéà Usage--------Since Flake8-AAA is a Flake8 plugin, the majority of its usage isdependent on how you use Flake8. In general you can point it at your sourcecode and test suite:.. code-block:: shell    flake8 src testsIf you're not already using Flake8 then you might consider:* Adding a hook to your code editor to run Flake8 when you save a file.* Adding a pre-commit hook to your source code manager to run Flake8 before you  commit.* Running Flake8 before you execute your test suite - locally or in CI.If you just want Flake8-AAA error messages you can filter errors returned byFlake8 with ``--select``:.. code-block:: shell    flake8 --select AAA testsFurther reading:* `Flake8-AAA options and configuration  &lt;https://flake8-aaa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options.html&gt;`_.* `Using Flake8 &lt;https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/stable/user/index.html&gt;`_.‚õèÔ∏è Compatibility----------------Flake8-AAA works with:* Pytest and unittest test suites.* Black and yapf formatted code.* Mypy and type-annotated code.* Active versions of Python 3 as listed on the `python.org downloads page  &lt;https://www.python.org/downloads/&gt;`_.Further reading:* `Full compatibility list  &lt;https://flake8-aaa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/compatibility.html&gt;`_ - includes  how to configure Flake8-AAA to work with Black and information on support for  older versions of Python.üìï Resources------------* `Documentation on ReadTheDocs &lt;https://flake8-aaa.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_* `Package on PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/flake8-aaa/&gt;`_* `Source code on GitHub &lt;https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa&gt;`_* `Licensed on MIT &lt;https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/blob/master/LICENSE&gt;`_* `Changelog &lt;https://github.com/jamescooke/flake8-aaa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst&gt;`_* `#flake8_aaa hashtag on Mastodon &lt;https://fosstodon.org/tags/flake8_aaa&gt;`_</longdescription>
