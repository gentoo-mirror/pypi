	<longdescription>dbt-schema-builder=============================|pypi-badge| |ci-badge| |codecov-badge| |pyversions-badge||license-badge|The Schema Builder tool is used to create dbt schema files, sql models, anddefault PII / non-PII views for tables in the given Snowflake schemas.For each specified application schema, the script will generate dbt models fora ``&lt;SCHEMA&gt;`` and ``&lt;SCHEMA&gt;_PII`` schema. We refer to these schemas as a&quot;trifecta&quot;.* ``&lt;SCHEMA&gt;_&lt;RAW_SUFFIX&gt;`` contains the original source tables.* ``&lt;SCHEMA&gt;_PII`` contains views on the _RAW tables that have un-redacted PII.* ``&lt;SCHEMA&gt;`` contains views on the _RAW tables sensitive data redacted.Application schemas can be sourced from multiple raw schemas. This allows youto specify which tables should be pulled from which raw schema to construct the&quot;trifecta&quot;.Schema Builder ensures that all three schemas provide the same interface to thedata (number and order of columns match what is present in the _RAW schema).Once the script is successfully run, you can execute a `dbt run` to create orupdate the views in ``&lt;SCHEMA&gt;`` and ``&lt;SCHEMA&gt;_PII``. If your source data inthe ``&lt;SCHEMA&gt;_&lt;RAW_SUFFIX&gt;`` schema changes you should run Schema Builder frequentlyto keep up with changes in the tables and columns stored there.Schema Builder will also automatically create sources in one or more other dbtprojects so that they can use the results of these models as sources.See `the docs &lt;https://dbt-schema-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_ for moreinformation.License-------The code in this repository is licensed under the AGPL 3.0 unlessotherwise noted.Please see `LICENSE.txt &lt;LICENSE.txt&gt;`_ for details.How To Contribute-----------------Contributions are very welcome.Please read `How To Contribute &lt;https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst&gt;`_ for details.Even though they were written with ``edx-platform`` in mind, the guidelinesshould be followed for all Open edX projects.The pull request description template should be automatically applied if you are creating a pull request from GitHub.
