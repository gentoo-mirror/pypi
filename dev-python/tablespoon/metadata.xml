If you are looking for animpressive probabilistic forecasting package see the list of recommendation atthe bottom of this README. This package is &lt;b&gt;exceptionally ordinary&lt;/b&gt;. It isexpected that this package may be used as a compliment to what is already outthere.# Why Run Simple MethodsWe have found, by experience, many good uses for the methods in this package.To often we see that forecast methods go in production without a naive method toaccompany it. This is a missed opportunity.1. **Naive May Be Good Enough**: How good is good enough? I have almost never started a project where the firm receiving the forecast knew the answer to this question, but it is important to get to it early. I think all of us would agree that a forecast error of 0 is best, but in reality how much time should be spent spinning our wheels to get there. Further, many business applications can‚Äôt be improved upon even with significant forecast error reduction. I remember hearing a story of a firm which ordered units on pallets. The firm paid by the pallet, not the unit. The forecast team was able to reduce the forecast error, but in the end this did not change the outcome. This is the ‚Äòpallet problem‚Äô. As data scientists it is easy to think of error reduction as a continuous function, but this need not map the same way to business value. In this example the continuous error reduction mapped to a discrete pallet. This is a long way of saying, ‚ÄúA naive forecast may be good enough‚Äù. What is a naive forecasting method? I typically think of two methods. The mean forecast and the naive forecast. I will go over these in more detail below. There are also some applications where naive methods have been shown to be hard to beat.2. **Get A Denominator for Relative Metrics**: Though naive methods can usually   be beat it is good to know the relative improvement over the benchmark. This   can allow a forecasting team to market their alternative forecast when the   'skill score' is impressive.3. **Easy to productionize and get expectations**: Get a sense for *how good is   good enough*. In many applications a forecast team is asked to forecast, but   stakeholders provide no line-in-the-sand for when the forecasting work needs   to stop. One reasonable approach is to run the benchmarks found in this   package then beat the best performing benchmark by a margin that is   statistically significant.4. **Resilience in Production - Why not have many models?**: Sometimes, despite   best efforts the production model does something unexpected. In this   case it is nice to have a simple backup that is cheap to generate and good   enough to fall back on. In this way a production forecast pipeline gains   strength from a diversity of models.5. **Easy Uncertainty Quantification**: Recently we see that applications   are not about forecast accuracy, but instead about forecasting uncertainty.   Capturing the full distribution helps firms set &quot;service levels&quot; aka   percentiles of the distribution for which they are prepared to serve. Even   if you have the worlds most accurate unbiased forecast the median point is   , by definition, an underforecast half the time. For this reason it is best to provide a   distribution of simulated future values and the firm may decide for   themselves what risks they are or are not willing to take.# Quick ExampleWe show a quick example below. For more examples see [Simple Example](https://alexhallam.github.io/tablespoon/section/plotting/), [Extended Example](https://alexhallam.github.io/tablespoon/section/extended/)There are also some Notebook examples1.

We document the parameterization of the models to make this as   obvious and uninteresting as possible. See [Forecast Method Math Documentation](https://alexhallam.github.io/tablespoon/section/math/)3. ‚ôú**Stable**: We want this package to feel rock solid. For this to happen   we keep the feature set relatively small. We believe that after the initial    development of this package we should spend out time maintaining the code as   oppose to thinking of new features.4. ‚ôû**Distributional**: Quantification of uncertainty is the name of   the game.# Non-Goals1. üî•**Circut Melting Focus on Speed**: Not to say this is a slow package. In fact, it is very fast!    We just don't put any extra effort to make it faster than `numpy`.2. ü§ñ**New/Complex Forecast Models**: Again, this is out of scope.
