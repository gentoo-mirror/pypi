	<longdescription>frigg-worker |Build status| |Coverage status|=============================================A worker application that listens to the frigg broker, picks up buildsand builds them.Setup-----::    virtualenv ~/frigg-worker    ~/frigg-worker/bin/pip install frigg-worker    ~/frigg-worker/bin/frigg-workerUsage-----::    $ frigg_worker --help    Usage: frigg_worker MODE [OPTIONS]    Options:      --dispatcher-url TEXT    URL to the dispatcher, overrides settings      --dispatcher-token TEXT  Token for dispatcher, overrides settings      --hq-url TEXT            URL for frigg-hq, overrides settings      --hq-token TEXT          Token for frigg-hq, overrides settings      --slack-url TEXT         URL for incoming webhook in slack      --sentry-dsn TEXT        Sentry dsn needed to connect to the sentry API      --loglevel TEXT          Set log level for frigg-packages      --help                   Show this message and exit.The worker has two modes `builder` and `deployer` which defines whether the worker shouldbuild and run tests or deploy previews.Builder~~~~~~~Runs tasks within a given docker container before removing the docker container and reportsto the build report API of HQ.Deployer~~~~~~~~Starts a docker container that will run for the amount of time specified by the task payloadbefore running deploy tasks inside the container. The container exposes port 8000 to a porton the host system given by the task payload. The container-image is chosen from the taskpayload, thus, the worker trusts the task-queue to only contain tasks with allowed images.The status of the deployments is reported to the preview-deployment API of HQ.Running frigg-worker from source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~::    python -m frigg_worker.cli--------------MIT Â© frigg.io.. |Build status| image:: https://ci.frigg.io/badges/frigg/frigg-worker/   :target: https://ci.frigg.io/frigg/frigg-worker/.. |Coverage status| image:: https://ci.frigg.io/badges/coverage/frigg/frigg-worker/   :target: https://ci.frigg.io/frigg/frigg-worker/</longdescription>
