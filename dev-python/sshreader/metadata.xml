	<longdescription># [sshreader][]## Overview[SSHreader][] is a Python Module for multiprocessing/threading ssh connections in order to make ssh operationsacross multiple servers parallel.  It utilizes the [Paramiko](http://www.paramiko.org/) module for its ssh client.In order to maintain the widest range of compatibility, [SSHreader][] is currently tested using the following versions ofPython:* Python3.7* Python3.8* Python3.9* Python3.10* Python3.11## License[SSHreader][] is released under [GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0][],see the file LICENSE and LICENSE.lesser for the license text.## InstallationThe most straightforward way to get the [SSHreader][] module working for you is:```commandlinepip install sshreader```This will ensure that all the requirements are met.### Development InstallationIf you are wanting to work on development of [SSHreader][] perform the following:```commandlinemake install```To ensure all development requirements are met. This will allow you to build the Sphinx Documentation for [SSHreader][]or run the unit/integration tests!## DocumentationThe documentation for [SSHreader][] can be found [here](https://sshreader.readthedocs.io)### Building DocsIf you have installed the requirements for [SSHreader][] you can build its Sphinx Documentation simply by:```commandlinemake docs```Then simply open `docs/build/html/index.html` in your browser.## ContributingComments and enhancements are very welcome.Report any issues or feature requests on the [BitBucket bugtracker](https://bitbucket.org/isaiah1112/sshreader/issues?status=new&amp;status=open). Please include a minimal(not-) working example which reproduces the bug and, if appropriate, the traceback information.  Please do not request features already being workedtowards.Code contributions are encouraged: please feel free to [fork theproject](https://bitbucket.org/isaiah1112/sshreader) and submit pull requests to the develop branch.## ExtrasIncluded with sshreader is a binary called **pydsh** (generally installed in /usr/local/bin/).  This works very similar to[pdsh](https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/pdsh.html) but uses sshreader at its core to perform ssh commands in paralleland return the results.  The output of *pydsh* can also be piped through the **dshbak** tool that comes with pdsh.Pydsh uses [hostlist expressions](https://www.nsc.liu.se/~kent/python-hostlist/) to get its list of hoststo process.[GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0]: http://choosealicense.com/licenses/lgpl-3.0/ &quot;LGPL v3&quot;[sshreader]: https://bitbucket.org/isaiah1112/sshreader &quot;SSHreader Package&quot;</longdescription>
