The config directory is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/SMD` (`~/.config/SMD` if variable not set), you can specify a different config to be used like this:```SMD -c &quot;path/to/config&quot; mode arguments```Examples:```SMD -c &quot;~/Downloader/config.json&quot; down link_to_manga -lSMD -c &quot;~/Downloader/config.json&quot; update```To create the config file the downloader needs to successfully finish. If you want to have the config created before you use the downloader you can do:```SMD conf```## DetailsFor a more detailed explanation of the modes and their available arguments read the [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) file in the git repo.# ChangelogChangelog can be found in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) in the git repo.</longdescription>
