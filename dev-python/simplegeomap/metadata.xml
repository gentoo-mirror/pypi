	<longdescription># SimpleGeoMapGiven a center latitude, longitude and a zoom level simply plot allcountry boundaries, rivers, lakes, elevation contour lines that fit onthe map, using offline data. This package is self-contained, it doesnot need net connectivity to get its data.Each land feature can be enabled through its API call. ## Installation`pip install simplegeomap`## How To Use```pythonimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport simplegeomapclat,clon=41,14; zoom = 1.0simplegeomap.plot_countries(clat,clon,zoom)simplegeomap.plot_water(clat,clon,zoom)simplegeomap.plot_elevation(clat,clon,zoom)plt.savefig('map.jpg',quality=30)```![](map.jpg)Regions can be plotted by passing polygon points in an N x 2 numpy array to the`plot_region` call. This call assumes the last point connects to the first point,hence creating a closed region. If we want the points to represent a curve/line,without the end connecting to its beginning, then `plot_line` can be used.## Datafiles, PreprocessingPreprocessing when necessary has already been executed, their resultare already placed inside the package. Listed below are sources, stepsjust in case, if one wants to preprocess with different parameters, so on.Country Border Datafile comes from [here](https://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php)For water regions the lake/river data from [NOAA](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/data/gshhg/latest/)was used.In order to regenerate the water file from its raw sources, see`util.preprocess_GSHHS`, assuming the data is unzipped under `/tmp` itwill recreate the datafile.[Cities](https://github.com/dr5hn/countries-states-cities-database/blob/master/csv/cities.csv).The only addition here was a new column for asciified city names using`import unidecode; unidecode.unidecode(..)`. Elevation Data is taken from NOAA, datafile is from [here](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/topo/gltiles.html)download &quot;all files in on zip&quot;, extract zip under /tmp, then run `util.preprocess_GLOBE`.## Links[Programming Articles on Python, IT](https://burakbayramli.github.io/dersblog/sk/)[Linear Algebra, Calculus](https://burakbayramli.github.io/dersblog/)</longdescription>
