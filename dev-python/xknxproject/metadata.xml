For bigger projects this might as well be &gt;3s.Not all supported languages are included in project / application data. If the configured language is not found, the default language will be used - which is manufacturer / product dependent.## Installation`pip install xknxproject`## Usage```python&quot;&quot;&quot;Extract and parse a KNX project file.&quot;&quot;&quot;from xknxproject.models import KNXProjectfrom xknxproject import XKNXProjknxproj: XKNXProj = XKNXProj(    path=&quot;path/to/your/file.knxproj&quot;,    password=&quot;password&quot;,  # optional    language=&quot;de-DE&quot;,  # optional)project: KNXProject = knxproj.parse()```The resulting `KNXProject` is a typed dictionary and can be used just like a dictionary, or can be exported as JSON.You can find an example file (exported JSON) in our test suite under https://github.com/XKNX/xknxproject/tree/main/test/resources/stubsThe full type definition can be found here: https://github.com/XKNX/xknxproject/blob/main/xknxproject/models/knxproject.py</longdescription>
