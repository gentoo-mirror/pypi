	<longdescription># minique /miniÀêk/A minimal Redis 4.0+ job queue for Python 3.7 and above.## Requirements* Python 3.7+* Redis 4.0+## Usage- Have a Redis 4.0+ server running.### Client```pythonfrom redis import StrictRedisfrom minique.api import enqueue, get_job# Get a Redis connection, somehow.redis = StrictRedis.from_url('redis://localhost:6379/4')job = enqueue(    redis=redis,    queue_name='work',    callable='my_jobs.calcumacalate',  # Dotted path to your callable.    kwargs={'a': 5, 'b': 5},  # Only kwargs supported.    # You can also set a `job_id` yourself (but it must be unique))job_id = job.id  # Save the job ID somewhere, maybe?while not job.has_finished:    pass  # Twiddle thumbs...print(job.result)  # Okay!# Get the same job later (though not later than 7 days (by default)):job = get_job(redis, job_id)```### Worker(s)- Ensure your workers are able to import the functions you wish to run.- Set the callables the worker will allow with `--allow-callable`.  - Alternately, you may wish to subclass `minique.work.job_runner.JobRunner`    to specify an entirely different lookup mechanism.```bash$ minique -u redis://localhost:6379/4 -q work -q anotherqueue -q thirdqueue --allow-callable 'my_jobs.*'```## Sentry SupportMinique automatically integrates with the [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/)exception tracking service.You can use the `[sentry]` [installation extra][extras] to install `sentry-sdk` along with Minique,or you can do it manually.Simply set the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable; if all goes well,you should see a &quot;Sentry configured with a valid DSN&quot; message at CLI boot.The [other environment-configurable options](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/options/)also work as you would expect.Exceptions occurring during job execution will be sent to Sentry and annotated with `minique` contextdescribing the job ID and queue name.### Development* Linting happens with `pre-commit`.* Tests are run with `pytest`. (Install with `pip install -e .[test]`.)* Code in `minique` is expected to pass `mypy --strict`.[extras]: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-setuptools-extras</longdescription>
