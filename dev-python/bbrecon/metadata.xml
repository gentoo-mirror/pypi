The API aims to provide a continuously up-to-date map of the Internet &quot;safe harbor&quot; attack surface, excluding out-of-scope targets.It comes with an ergonomic CLI and Python library.## Important NoticeWhile effort is taken to ensure the results returned by `bbrecon` are reliable and trustworthy, this service and its operators are in no way responsible for what you do with the data provided.Double check your scopes and ensure you stay within safe harbors.## Features- **Public Programs** - public bug bounty programs indexed and searchable with filters (live)- **Domains** - domains in scope across programs (live)- **Private Programs** - support for private programs (September 2020)- **Notifications** - webhook alerts when programs are created, updated or domains discovered (September 2020)- **Endpoints** - all HTTP and non-HTTP endpoints in scope across all programs (October 2020)## Status`bbrecon` is in a gradual **Beta** release phase; major features are released every few weeks to get feedback and fix kinks. You can sign up and start using it, but be aware that **breaking changes may be deployed without notice**. While the service and infrastructure is designed to scale, it is **not currently configured to serve a large global audience**. This will change, but for now YMMV.## HelpPlease report bugs with [GitHub issues](https://github.com/serain/bbrecon/issues).Use the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/bbrecon/community) for support or enquiring about service availability during beta.## Getting Started### API keyFetch an API key from the Console: https://console.bugbountyrecon.comOnly Google SSO is supported at this time.### Installation```$ pip3 install bbrecon```&gt; `bbrecon` requires Python &gt;= 3.8 - if `pip` tells you it can't find `bbrecon` it's probably because `pip` is using another Python version. Check this with `pip3 --version`.If you intend to use the CLI, you should permanently configure your key:```$ bbrecon configure keyEnter your API key: YOUR_API_KEY```You can alternatively set the `BBRECON_KEY` environment variable if you prefer.## CLIThe following will output all programs released in the last month that have &quot;web&quot; type targets (APIs/web apps):```$ bbrecon get programs --type web --since last-monthSLUG         PLATFORM     CREATED     REWARDS      MIN.BOUNTY    AVG.BOUNTY    MAX.BOUNTY      SCOPES  TYPEScybrary      bugcrowd     2020-07-22  fame         $0            $0            $0                   6  android,ios,webexpressvpn   bugcrowd     2020-07-14  cash,fame    $150          $1047         $2500               17  android,ios,other,webprestashop   yeswehack    2020-07-23  cash         $0            $0            $1000                1  web...```To get scopes for specific programs, use `get scopes`:```$ bbrecon get scopes rockset codefi-bbpSLUG        PLATFORM    TYPE    VALUErockset     hackerone   web     console.rockset.comrockset     hackerone   web     docs.rockset.comrockset     hackerone   web     api.rs2.usw2.rockset.comcodefi-bbp  hackerone   web     activate.codefi.network```To get domains for specific programs, use `get domains`:```$ bbrecon get domains dropcontact rebellion-defenseSLUG               DOMAIN                    CREATEDdropcontact        www.dropcontact.io        2020-08-23rebellion-defense  mooch.rip                 2020-08-23rebellion-defense  www.rebelliondefense.com  2020-08-23rebellion-defense  rebelliondefense.com      2020-08-23...```Most commands can output JSON to make it easy to work with your scripts. Try `--output json`:```$ bbrecon get programs --output json[    {        &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://bugcrowd.com/optimizely&quot;,        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Optimizely&quot;,        &quot;platform&quot;: &quot;bugcrowd&quot;,        &quot;rewards&quot;: [            &quot;cash&quot;,            &quot;fame&quot;        ],...```You can get information about specific programs by passing one or many slugs to the `get programs` command:```$ bbrecon get programs twago optimizelySLUG        PLATFORM    CREATED     REWARDS    MIN.BOUNTY    AVG.BOUNTY    MAX.BOUNTY      SCOPES  TYPEStwago       intigriti   2020-04-09             $0            $0            $0                   5  weboptimizely  bugcrowd    2018-03-22  cash,fame  $0            $750          $5000                6  web```Use `--help` to get a list of filters for each command:```$ bbrecon get programs --help...                                  Output format.  [default: wide]  -n, --name TEXT                 Filter by name.  -t, --type TEXT                 Filter by scope type.

A specific date in the format                                  '%Y-%m-%d' can be supplied. Alternatively,                                  the following keywords are supported:                                  'yesterday', 'last-week', 'last-month',                                  'last-year' as well as 'last-X-days' (where                                  'X' is an integer)....```Note that some filters are lists, and can be used multiple times! If you wanted to get all programs that have mobile apps in scope you could run:```$ bbrecon get programs --type android --type iosSLUG           PLATFORM     CREATED     REWARDS      MIN.BOUNTY    AVG.BOUNTY    MAX.BOUNTY  SCOPES  TYPESsquare         bugcrowd     2018-03-22  cash,fame    $300          $492          $5000            4  android,ios,other,webgojek          bugcrowd     2018-03-22  cash,fame    $200          $618          $5000            4  android,ios,websmartthings    bugcrowd     2018-03-22  fame         $0            $0            $0               5  android,hardware,ios,web...```## PythonYou are invited to check out this repo's codebase for more details, but to get started:```python3from bbrecon import BugBountyReconbb = BugBountyRecon(token=&quot;API_KEY&quot;)programs = bb.programs(    types=[&quot;web&quot;, &quot;ios&quot;],    platforms=[&quot;hackerone&quot;],    rewards=[&quot;cash&quot;],)for program in programs:    print(f&quot;{program.name} rewards up to ${program.maximum_bounty}!&quot;)    print(f&quot;More information is available at: {program.url}&quot;)    for scope in program.in_scope:        if scope.type == &quot;desktop&quot;:            print(&quot;Found a desktop app in scope for this program. Cool!&quot;)    domains = list(bb.domains(programs=[program.slug]))    print(&quot;Here are some domains for this program:&quot;)    for domain in domains[:3]:        print(domain.name)```## REST APIYou can interact directly with the REST API if you prefer.
