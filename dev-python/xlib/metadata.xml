	<longdescription>The Python X Library====================|Build Status| |codecov.io| |Code Health|`Homepage`_ | `Releases`_ | `Changelog`_Copyright~~~~~~~~~The main part of the code is::    Copyright (C) 2000-2002  Peter LiljenbergSome contributed code is copyrighted by `the contributors &lt;Contributors_&gt;`_,in these cases that is indicated in the source files in question.The Python X Library is released under LGPL v2.1 or later (since 2016),see the file LICENSE for details. 0.15rc1 and before were released underGPL v2.Requirements~~~~~~~~~~~~The Python X Library requires Python 2.7 or newer. It has been tested tovarious extents with Python 2.7 and 3.3 through 3.6.Installation~~~~~~~~~~~~The Python Xlib uses the standard setuptools package, to install runthis command:::    python setup.py installSee the command help for details: ``python setup.py install -h``.Alternatively, you can run programs from the distribution directory, orchange the module path in programs.There's a simple example program, implemented twice using both thehigh-level interface and the low-level protocol.Introduction~~~~~~~~~~~~The Python X Library is intended to be a fully functional X clientlibrary for Python programs. It is written entirely in Python, incontrast to earlier X libraries for Python (the ancient X extension andthe newer plxlib) which were interfaces to the C Xlib.This is possible to do since X client programs communicate with the Xserver via the X protocol. The communication takes place over TCP/IP,Unix sockets, DECnet or any other streaming network protocol. The C Xlibis merely an interface to this protocol, providing functions suitablefor a C environment.There are three advantages of implementing a pure Python library:-  Integration: The library can make use of the wonderful object system   in Python, providing an easy-to-use class hierarchy.-  Portability: The library will be usable on (almost) any computer   which have Python installed. A C interface could be problematic to   port to non-Unix systems, such as MS Windows or OpenVMS.-  Maintainability: It is much easier to develop and debug native Python   modules than modules written in C.Documentation~~~~~~~~~~~~~The reference manual is not finished by far, but is probably still useful. Itcan be `browsed online &lt;http://python-xlib.sourceforge.net/doc/html/index.html&gt;`__.There are also some `example programs &lt;Examples_&gt;`_ and, of course,`the standard X11 documentation &lt;http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/&gt;`__ applies.Project status~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The low-level protocol is complete, implementing client-side X11R6. Thehigh-level object oriented interface is also fully functional. It ispossible to write client applications with the library. Currently, theonly real application using Python Xlib is the window manager PLWM,starting with version 2.0.There is a resource database implementation, ICCCM support and aframework for adding X extension code. Several extensions have beenimplemented; (RECORD, SHAPE, Xinerama, Composite, RANDR, and XTEST)patches for additions are very welcome.There are most likely still bugs, but the library is at least stableenough to run PLWM. A continuously bigger part of the library is coveredby regression tests, improving stability.The documentation is still quite rudimentary, but should be of some helpfor people programming with the Xlib. X beginners should first find somegeneral texts on X. A very good starting point ishttp://www.rahul.net/kenton/xsites.htmlSee the file TODO for a detailed list of what is missing, approximatelyordered by importance... _Homepage:     https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib.. _Releases:     https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib/releases.. _Changelog:    https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib/tree/master/CHANGELOG.md.. _Contributors: https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib/graphs/contributors.. _Examples:     https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib/tree/master/examples.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/python-xlib/python-xlib.svg?branch=master   :target: https://travis-ci.org/python-xlib/python-xlib.. |codecov.io| image:: https://codecov.io/github/python-xlib/python-xlib/coverage.svg?branch=master   :target: https://codecov.io/github/python-xlib/python-xlib?branch=master.. |Code Health| image:: https://landscape.io/github/python-xlib/python-xlib/master/landscape.svg?style=flat   :target: https://landscape.io/github/python-xlib/python-xlib/master</longdescription>
