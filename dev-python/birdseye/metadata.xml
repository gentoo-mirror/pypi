	<longdescription>|logo| birdseye===============|Build Status| |Supports Python versions 2.7 and 3.5+|birdseye is a Python debugger which records the values of expressions in afunction call and lets you easily view them after the function exits.For example:.. figure:: https://i.imgur.com/rtZEhHb.gif   :alt: Hovering over expressionsYou can use birdseye no matter how you run or edit your code. Just ``pip install birdseye``, add the ``@eye`` decoratoras seen above, run your function however you like, and view the results in your browser.It's also `integrated with some common tools &lt;http://birdseye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integrations.html&gt;`_ for a smoother experience.You can try it out **instantly** on `futurecoder &lt;https://futurecoder.io/course/#ide&gt;`_: enter your code in the editor on the left and click the ``birdseye`` button to run. No imports or decorators required.Feature Highlights------------------Rather than stepping through lines, move back and forth through loopiterations and see how the values of selected expressions change:.. figure:: https://i.imgur.com/236Gj2E.gif   :alt: Stepping through loop iterationsSee which expressions raise exceptions, even if theyâ€™re suppressed:.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/UxqDyIL.png   :alt: Exception highlightingExpand concrete data structures and objects to see their contents.Lengths and depths are limited to avoid an overload of data... figure:: http://i.imgur.com/PfmqZnT.png   :alt: Exploring data structures and objectsCalls are organised into functions (which are organised into files) andordered by time, letting you see what happens at a glance:.. figure:: https://i.imgur.com/5OrB76I.png   :alt: List of function calls.. |logo| image:: https://i.imgur.com/i7uaJDO.png.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.com/alexmojaki/birdseye.svg?branch=master   :target: https://travis-ci.com/alexmojaki/birdseye.. |Supports Python versions 2.7 and 3.5+| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/birdseye.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/birdseye.. inclusion-end-marker**Read more documentation** `here &lt;http://birdseye.readthedocs.io&gt;`_</longdescription>
