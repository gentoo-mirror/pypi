	<longdescription># AQT : Accurate Quantized TrainingAQT is a quantization library designed to allow utilization oflow-bit and high-performance numerics of contemporary ML hardware accelerators.AQT supports both research and production[^research-vs-prod], but focuses on the latter.[^research-vs-prod]: The support for research is exemplified by having a state of the art quantization quality on standard models such as ResNet and Transformer. The production aspect is defined as high performance and robust out-of-the-box working results with good defaults.## Citing AQTPlease use a following bibtex entry:```@software{aqt2022github,  author = {Lew, Lukasz and Feinberg, Vlad and Agrawal, Shivani and Lee, Jihwan and Malmaud, Jonathan and Wang, Lisa and  Dormiani, Pouya and Pope, Reiner },  title = {AQT: Accurate Quantized Training)},  url = {http://github.com/google/aqt},  year = {2022},}```</longdescription>
