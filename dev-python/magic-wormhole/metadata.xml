The two endpoints areidentified by using identical &quot;wormhole codes&quot;: in general, the sendingmachine generates and displays the code, which must then be typed into thereceiving machine.The codes are short and human-pronounceable, using a phonetically-distinctwordlist. The receiving side offers tab-completion on the codewords, sousually only a few characters must be typed. Wormhole codes are single-useand do not need to be memorized.* PyCon 2016 presentation: [Slides](http://www.lothar.com/~warner/MagicWormhole-PyCon2016.pdf), [Video](https://youtu.be/oFrTqQw0_3c)For complete documentation, please see https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.ioor the docs/ subdirectory.This program uses two servers, whose source code is kept in separaterepositories: the[mailbox server](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole-mailbox-server),and the[transit relay](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole-transit-relay).## License, CompatibilityMagic-Wormhole is released under the MIT license, see the `LICENSE` file for details.This library is compatible with Python 3.8 and higher (tested against3.8, and 3.9). It also still works with Python 2.7 although that is nolonger supported by upstream libraries like Cryptography, so it maystop working at any time.## Packaging, InstallationMagic Wormhole packages are included in many operating systems.[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/magic-wormhole.svg)](https://repology.org/project/magic-wormhole/versions)To install it without an OS package, follow the [Installation docs](https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/welcome.html#installation).</longdescription>
