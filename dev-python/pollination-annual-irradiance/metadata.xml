	<longdescription># Annual IrradianceCalculate solar irradiance (W/m2) and radiation (kWh/m2) at each time step provided by a wea file.The fundamental calculation of this recipe is the same as that of[Annual Daylight](https://github.com/pollination/annual-daylight) in that a detailedaccounting of direct sun is computed at each time step. However, the recipe computesbroadband solar irradiance in W/m2 instead of visible illuminance in lux.The detailed matrices of W/m2 at each time step are stored under `results/total`.Detailed matrices of just the direct component (W/m2) are output to `results/direct`.The following values are also recorded for each sensor point under the `metrics` folder:* `average_irradiance`: The average irradiance in W/m2 over the Wea time period* `peak_irradiance`: The highest irradiance value in W/m2 during the Wea time period* `cumulative_radiation`: The cumulative radiation in kWh/m2 over the Wea time periodThe `peak_irradiance` value is suitable for assessing the worst-case solar loadon cooling design days or the highest radiant temperatures that occupants mightexperience in over the time period of the Wea.</longdescription>
