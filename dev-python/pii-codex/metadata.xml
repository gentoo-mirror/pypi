There was a need to not only detect PII in text, but also identify its severity, associated categorizations in cybersecurity research and policy documentation, and provide a way for others in similar research efforts to reproduce or extend the research. PII Codex is a combination of systematic research, conceptual frameworks, third-party open source software, and cloud service provider integrations. The categorizations are directly influenced by the research of Milne et al. (2016) while the ranking is a result of category severities on the scale provided by Schwartz and Solove (2012) from Non-Identifiable, Semi-Identifiable, and Identifiable.The outputs of the primary PII Codex analysis and adapter functions are AnalysisResult or AnalysisResultSet objects that will provide a listing of detections, severities, mean risk scores for each string processed, and summary statistics on the analysis made. The final outputs do not contain the original texts but instead will provide where to find the detections should the end-user care for this information in their analysis.### Statement of NeedThe general knowledge base of identifiable data, the usage restrictions of this data, and the associated policies surrounding it have shifted drastically over the years. The tech industry has had to adjust to many policy changes regarding the tracking of individuals, the usage of data from online profiles and platforms, and the right to be forgotten entirely from a service or platform (GDPR). While the shift has provided data protections around the globe, the majority of technology users continue to have little to no control over their personal information with third-party data consumers (Trepte, 2020). Understanding if identifiable data types exist in a data set can prevent accidental sharing of such data by allowing its detection in the first place and, in the case of this software package, present sanitized strings, the reasons to why the token was considered to be PII, and permit for the results to be publishable.### Potential UsagesPotential usages include sanitizing of dataset strings (e.g. a collection of social media posts), presenting results to users for software examining their interactions (e.g. UX research on user-awareness in cybersecurity applications), etc.&lt;hr/&gt;## Running Locally with PoetryThis project uses Poetry. To run this project, install `poetry` and proceed to follow the instructions under `/docs/LOCAL_SETUP.md`.`Note: This project has only been tested with Ubuntu and MacOS and with Python versions 3.9 and 3.10. You may need to upgrade pip ahead of installation.`## Installing with PIPVideo capture of install provided in LOCAL_SETUP.md file. Make sure you set up a virtual environment with either python 3.9 or 3.10 and upgrade pip with:```bashpip install --upgrade pippip install -U pip setuptools wheel # only needed if you haven't already done so ```Before adding `pii-codex` on your project, download the spaCy `en_core_web_lg` model:```bashpip install -U spacypython3 -m spacy download en_core_web_lg```For more details on spaCy installation and usage, refer to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://spacy.io/usage&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;.The repository releases are hosted on PyPi and can be installed with:```bashpip install pii-codexpip install &quot;pii-codex[detections]&quot;````Note: The extras installed with pii-codex[detections] are the spaCy, Micrisoft Presidio Analyzer, and Microsoft Anonymzer packages.`Using Poetry:```bashpoetry updatepoetry add pii-codexpoetry install pii-codex --extras=&quot;detections&quot;```For those using Google Collab, check out the example notebook:[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/EdyVision/802ce21aab21eb5d9afa9e43d301eef7/pii-codex-sample-notebook.ipynb)## UsageVideo capture of usage provided in LOCAL_SETUP.md.### Sample Input / OutputThe built-in analyzer uses Microsoft Presidio. Feed in a collection of strings with analyze_collection() or just a single string with analyze_item(). Those analyzing a collection of strings will also be provided with statistics calculated on the risk scores for detected items.```pythonfrom pii_codex.services.analysis_service import PIIAnalysisServicePIIAnalysisService().analyze_collection(    texts=[&quot;your collection of strings&quot;],    language_code=&quot;en&quot;,    collection_name=&quot;Data Set Label&quot;, # Optional Labeling    collection_type=&quot;SAMPLE&quot; # Defaults to POPULATION, used stats calculations)```You can also pass in a `data` param (dataframe) instead of simple text array with a text column and a metadata column to be analyzed for those analyzing social media posts. Current metadata supported are `URL`, `LOCATION`, and `SCREEN_NAME`.Sample output (results object converted to `dict` from notebook):```{    &quot;collection_name&quot;: &quot;PII Collection 1&quot;,    &quot;collection_type&quot;: &quot;POPULATION&quot;,    &quot;analyses&quot;: [        {            &quot;analysis&quot;: [                {                    &quot;pii_type_detected&quot;: &quot;PERSON&quot;,                    &quot;risk_level&quot;: 3,                    &quot;risk_level_definition&quot;: &quot;Identifiable&quot;,                    &quot;cluster_membership_type&quot;: &quot;Financial Information&quot;,                    &quot;hipaa_category&quot;: &quot;Protected Health Information&quot;,                    &quot;dhs_category&quot;: &quot;Linkable&quot;,                    &quot;nist_category&quot;: &quot;Directly PII&quot;,                    &quot;entity_type&quot;: &quot;PERSON&quot;,                    &quot;score&quot;: 0.85,                    &quot;start&quot;: 21,                    &quot;end&quot;: 24,                }            ],            &quot;index&quot;: 0,            &quot;risk_score_mean&quot;: 3,            &quot;sanitized_text: &quot;Hi!
