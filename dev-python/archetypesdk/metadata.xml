	<longdescription># Archetype Python LibraryThe Archetype Python library provides convenient access to the Archetype API from applications written in Python. It includes a pre-defined set of classes for API resources that initialize themselves dynamically from API responses which makes it compatible with a wide range of versions of the Archetype API.The SDK has everything you need to build and manage API subscriptions, usage-based billing, tracking metered usage, issue volume based discounts, graduated pricing models and more.# About Archetype[Archetype](https://archetype.dev) is the revenue infrastruce that make API monetization quick and painless. It works by integrating powerful, reliable purchase server with cross-platform support. Our open-source framework provides a backend and a wrapper around payment processors like Stripe to save engineers months from having to build custom billing infrastructure for their APIs.Whether you are building a new API or already have millions of customers, you can use Archetype to:-   Fetch products, make purchases, and check subscription status with our  [native SDKs](https://docs.archetype.dev/docs/installation).-   Host add [configure products](https://docs.archetype.dev/docs/products) remotely from our dashboard.-   Analyze the most important metrics for your app business  [in one place](https://docs.archetype.dev/docs/analytics).-   See customer transaction histories, chart lifetime value, and  [grant promotional subscriptions](https://docs.archetype.dev/docs/users).Sign up to [get started](https://app.archetype.dev/signup).# DocumentationIf looking to use our APIs directly, the [API reference](https://docs.archetype.dev/reference/basic) is here.With Archetype, you can keep track of all your app transactions in one place â€” whether your customers are charged through iOS, Android, or the web. As the single source of truth for your API business, we make sure your customers' subscription status is always up to date.# Installation**[Explore the docs and view the quickstart guide](https://docs.archetype.dev/docs/quickstart-guide)**You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the package. If you just want to use the package, just run:```shpip install --upgrade archetypesdk```## RequirementsPython 3.6+ (PyPy supported)# UsageThe library needs to be configured with your account's **app_id** and **secret key** which is available in your **[Archetype Dashboard](app.archetype.dev/settings)**. Set `archetype.app_id` and `archetype.secret_key` to their values:```pythonimport archetypesdk as archetypearchetype.app_id = &quot;ARCHETYPE_APP_ID&quot;archetype.secret_key = &quot;ARCHETYPE_SECRET_KEY&quot;CUSTOM_CUSTOMER_UID = &quot;XXX&quot;# list customerscustomers = archetype.Customer.All()# print the first customer's emailprint(customers[0][&quot;email&quot;])# retrieve specific Customercustomer = archetype.Customer.Retrieve(CUSTOM_CUSTOMER_UID)# print that customer's emailprint(customer[&quot;email&quot;])## Track a Metered Usagearchetype.BillableMetric.LogUsage(    custom_uid=CUSTOM_CUSTOMER_UID,     billable_metric_id=BILLABLE_METRIC_ID,     used_amount=AMOUNT,)# Authorize a Flask Request with Archetype Middelwarefrom flask import Flaskapp = Flask(__name__)@app.route(&quot;/a&quot;, methods=[&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;POST&quot;])@archetype.Authdef auth_test_url():    return jsonify({&quot;response&quot;: &quot;success!&quot;}), 200# Authorize a Django Request with Archetype Middelware@archetype.Authdef sensitive_fbv(request, *args, **kwargs):    return HttpResponse()# Authorize a FastAPI Request with Archetype Middelwarefrom archetypesdk.fastapi import authorized@app.get(&quot;/authorize&quot;)async def hello_world(is_authorized = Depends(authorized)):    return {&quot;response&quot;: &quot;Success&quot;}```You can leverage the SDK to create and configure billable metrics, products, token management, authorization and more.
