	<longdescription>txt2boil========This is a boilerplate generator that generates code based on thecomments it finds in source code.  Motivation----------The motivation is that ordinary boilerplate generators either requireyou to hack the build system you're using (to build the source code onthe fly) or you statically generate the boiler plate (and are thenunable to modify it or generate more without pulling together thescript that first generated it).The original use of this was to generate definitions of constants inhomework assignments done in the Racket programming language.  So asan example of writing a test code for rational number data-type::    ;; Constant Gen: r([0-9]+)/([0-9]+) (make-rational \1 \2)        (check-expect (rational-add r7/9 r5/6) r29/18)Would become::    ;; Constant Gen: r([0-9]+)/([0-9]+) (make-rational \1 \2)    (define r29/18 (make-rational 29 18))    (define r5/6 (make-rational 5 6))    (define r7/9 (make-rational 7 9))    (check-expect (rational-add r7/9 r5/6) r29/18)And no matter how many times you run the program on the source file,it will only generate the same output, or add/remove boilerplateaccording to how the source file changed.With this, one can keep the boilerplate in VCS and use ``txt2boil`` toupdate it whenever they need to.Installation------------The preferred way to install this is using pip::    pip install txt2boilAlthough if you're not a regular pip user or are not used to using pipthen the alternative is to just download the repository with git::    git clone https://github.com/kcolford/txt2boil.git    cd txt2boilOr you can download the tar package from the PyPi website by `clickinghere &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txt2boil&gt;`_ and then clicking onthe big green Download icon.  Alternatively you can use ``wget`` (or``curl`` if you prefer)::    wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/t/txt2boil/txt2boil-x.x.x.tar.gzOnce you have the tar ball, unpack it and change to the directorycontaining it::    tar xf txt2boil-x.x.x.tar.gz    cd txt2boil-x.x.xOnce you're in the source repository (regardless of how you got it)run the ``setup.py`` script::    python setup.py installHow To Use----------In order to use ``txt2boil`` as in the example above, simply use::    txt2boil -i rational.rktThe ``-i`` option specifies to update the file in place rather thanoutputting it on stdout.Supported Languages-------------------Language support all depends on what language the package's corelibrary has functionality for.  The current languages that aresupported are:- C- C++- Java- Python- RacketInternet Presence -----------------There are two significant web resources for txt2boil.  The first isthe source repository and the second is the PyPi page.  Regardless ofwhich one you go to, this document ought to be the main page foundthere.The primary source repository can be found at `Git Hub&lt;https://github.com/kcolford/txt2boil&gt;`_ while the PyPi (PythonPackage Index) page can be found `here&lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txt2boil/&gt;`_.While the Git Hub repository only has source code, the PyPi page hasdownloads for binary distributions.  These binary distributions areprovided by anyone generous enough to lend their computer to the taskof compiling them and uploading them.  Anyone who has privileges toupload to PyPi need only run either the shell script ``upload.sh``**or** the batch script ``upload.bat``.License-------Copyright (C) 2014 Kieran ColfordThis file is part of txt2boil.txt2boil is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify itunder the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by theFree Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at youroption) any later version. txt2boil is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, butWITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty ofMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
