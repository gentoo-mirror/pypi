But muskhas decided to turn that platform into a pay-for-play version of LinkedInand banished all the tinkerers. So, now I'm here.It has a bit of a weird structure. You basically do things like,```pythonasync with get_simple_client_session() as sess:    posts: GetPostsResp = await GetPostsReq(uris=[...]).do_xrpc(sess)    ...```which feels backwards from the expected,```pythonasync with get_simple_client_session() as sess:    posts: GetPostsResp = await sess.do_xrpc(GetPostsReq(uris=[...]))```or even,```pythonasync with get_simple_client_session() as sess:    posts: GetPostsResp = await sess.get_posts(uris=[...])```It's kinda an artifact of the way I did code generation but I kinda like itand fuck it S-expressions worked so there is a (completely nonsensical)precedence. **And, just to clarify, every request and response gets validated against the lexicon schema**, which is nice (although reference types are still a WIP). Moreover, the generated code is auto-complete/copilot friendly. And, in theory, you could override`do_xrpc` to do clever things like caching, instead of hacking each particular api call.But mostly I'm lazy so this is how it is.# Should I use this?~~Almost certainly not. Right now it's a bucket of slop. I offer no guarantees about the stability of the API, the correctness of theimplementation, or the quality of the documentation.~~If you want to use it, go ahead.Every single api call exists with Pydantic models for requests and responses(but with a few outstanding validations missing).It's still unstable but I've been using it pretty regularly.```bash# In your venv or mamba env or whateverpip install psychonaut```to use it as a library. This also installs the `psychonaut` command line tool.```bashpsychonaut --help# Temporary loginexport BSKY_USERNAME=yourusernameexport BSKY_PASSWORD=yourpassword# Permanent login (~/.psychonaut.json)psychonaut save-login yourusername psychonaut poast &quot;hey look, an annoying cron job&quot;```But definitely be mindful of the version because I'm going to break your code.Alternatively, just use [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)```bashpipx install psychonautexport BSKY_USERNAME=yourusernameexport BSKY_PASSWORD=yourpasswordpsychonaut poast &quot;hell yea, pipx&quot;```### Firehose**EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL AND STILL NOT FINISHED**`repos-firehose-stream` saves the raw messages for subsequent replay so youcan at least collect now and i'll get the json emit / validation workinglater.```bash# Stream the firehosepsychonaut repos-firehose-stream stream_dir# Stream the firehose but print to stdout toopsychonaut repos-firehose-stream --tee stream_dir# Replay serializedpsychonaut repos-firehose-replay stream_dir# Replay serialized filepsychonaut repos-firehose-replay stream_dir/your_stream.b64-lines```# How is this made?Initially, this was a collaboration between the [atproto repo](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto),me, and my friend ChatGPT (using GPT-4). I had been toying around with this automatic `langa`&lt;-&gt;`langb` transpiler in [langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain).My original goal was to jointly build that while making my python client from the `atproto`repo. However, the fine folks at OpenAI didn't give me GPT-4 API access, and GPT-3 isn't quite good enough to do the job. So instead, this was me testing the fences &quot;manually&quot; (with ChatGPT). And now it's *just*me.This also means this project was a bit...like theft? IDK. Question of the generative hour: where is the boundary?# See Also (for pythonistas)- [arroba](https://github.com/snarfed/arroba) - [lexrpc](https://github.com/snarfed/lexrpc) - [atprotools](https://github.com/ianklatzco/atprototools) </longdescription>
