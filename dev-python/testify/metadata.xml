	<longdescription>Testify - A Testing FrameworkTestify is a replacement for Python's unittest module and nose. It is modeled after unittest, and tests written for unittestwill run under testify with a minimum of adjustments, but it has features above and beyond unittest:  - class-level setup and teardown fixture methods which are run once each for an entire set of test methods.  - a decorator-based approach for fixture methods, eliminating the need for super() calls.  - More pythonic, less java  - enhanced test discovery - testify can drill down into packages to find test cases (similiar to nose).  - support for collecting and running tests by collecting modules, classes or methods into test suites.  - Pretty test runner output (color!)  - Extensible plugin system for adding additional functionality around reporting  - Comes complete with other handy testing utilities: Mocking (turtle), code coverage integration and profiling.</longdescription>
