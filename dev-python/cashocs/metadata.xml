For a introduction to these topics,we can recommend the textbooks- Optimal Control and general PDE constrained optimization    - `Hinze, Ulbrich, Ulbrich, and Pinnau - Optimization with PDE Constraints &lt;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-8839-1&gt;`_    - `Tröltzsch - Optimal Control of Partial Differential Equations &lt;https://doi.org/10.1090/gsm/112&gt;`_- Shape Optimization    - `Delfour and Zolesio - Shapes and Geometries &lt;https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9780898719826&gt;`_    - `Sokolowski and Zolesio - Introduction to Shape Optimization &lt;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-58106-9&gt;`_- FEniCS    - `Logg, Mardal, and Wells - Automated Solution of Differential Equations by the Finite Element Method &lt;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-23099-8&gt;`_    - `The FEniCS demos &lt;https://fenicsproject.org/docs/dolfin/latest/python/demos.html&gt;`_.. readme_end_disclaimerHowever, the `cashocs tutorial &lt;https://cashocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user&gt;`_ also gives many references eitherto the underlying theory of PDE constrained optimization or to relevant demosand documentation of FEniCS.An overview over cashocs and its capabilities can be found in `Blauth - cashocs: A Computational, Adjoint-BasedShape Optimization and Optimal Control Software &lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2020.100646&gt;`_. Moreover, note thatthe full cashocs documentation is available at `&lt;https://cashocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest&gt;`_... readme_start_installationInstallation============Via conda-forge---------------cashocs is available via the anaconda package manager, and you can install itwith.. code-block:: bash    conda install -c conda-forge cashocsAlternatively, you might want to create a new, clean conda environment with thecommand.. code-block:: bash    conda create -n &lt;ENV_NAME&gt; -c conda-forge cashocswhere `&lt;ENV_NAME&gt;` is the desired name of the new environment... note::    `Gmsh &lt;https://gmsh.info/&gt;`_ is now (starting with release 1.3.2) automatically installed with anaconda.Manual Installation-------------------- First, install `FEniCS &lt;https://fenicsproject.org/download/&gt;`_, version 2019.1.  Note that FEniCS should be compiled with PETSc and petsc4py.- Then, install `meshio &lt;https://github.com/nschloe/meshio&gt;`_, with a `h5py &lt;https://www.h5py.org&gt;`_  version that matches the HDF5 version used in FEniCS, and `matplotlib &lt;https://matplotlib.org/&gt;`_.  The version of meshio should be at least 4, but for compatibility it is recommended to use meshio 4.4.- You might also want to install `Gmsh &lt;https://gmsh.info/&gt;`_, version 4.8.  cashocs does not necessarily need this to work properly,  but it is required for the remeshing functionality... note::    If you are having trouble with using the conversion tool cashocs-convert from    the command line, then you most likely encountered a problem with hdf5 and h5py.    This can (hopefully) be resolved by following the suggestions from `this thread    &lt;https://fenicsproject.discourse.group/t/meshio-convert-to-xdmf-from-abaqus-raises-version-error-for-h5py/1480&gt;`_,    i.e., you should try to install `meshio &lt;https://github.com/nschloe/meshio&gt;`_    using the command    .. code-block:: bash        pip3 install meshio[all] --no-binary=h5py- You can install cashocs via the `PYPI &lt;https://pypi.org/&gt;`_ as follows  .. code-block:: bash      pip3 install cashocs- You can install the newest (development) version of cashocs with  .. code-block:: bash      pip3 install git+https://github.com/sblauth/cashocs.git- To get the latest (development) version of cashocs, clone this repository with git and install it with pip  .. code-block:: bash      git clone https://github.com/sblauth/cashocs.git      cd cashocs      pip3 install ... note::    To verify that the installation was successful, run the tests for cashocs    with    .. code-block:: bash        python3 -m pytest tests/    or simply    .. code-block:: bash        pytest tests/    from the source / repository root directory. Note that it might take some    time to perform all of these tests for the very first time, as FEniCS    compiles the necessary code. However, on subsequent iterations the    compiled code is retrieved from a cache, so that the tests are singificantly    faster... readme_end_installationUsage=====The complete cashocs documentation is available here `&lt;https://cashocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest&gt;`_. For a detailedintroduction, see the `cashocs tutorial &lt;https://cashocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user&gt;`_.
