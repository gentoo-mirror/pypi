	<longdescription># OrionBot: A Python bot training frameworkOrionBot is a Python library that allows you to easily train and run chatbots, fully customizable.## InstallationTo install OrionBot, simply use pip:```bashpip install orionbot```## UsageTo use OrionBot, simply import the `Chatbot` class and create a new instance with a name:```pythonfrom orionbot import Chatbotbot = Chatbot(&quot;My Bot&quot;)```### TrainingYou can train your bot by calling the `train` method with an input text and a response text:```pythonbot.train(&quot;Hi&quot;, &quot;Hello there!&quot;)```You can also train your bot from a file:```pythonbot.train_from_file(&quot;training_data.json&quot;)```Or, you can train your bot from the default file:```pythonbot.train_from_default_file()```### Getting ResponsesTo get a response from your bot, simply call the `get_response` method with an input text:```pythonresponse = bot.get_response(&quot;Hi&quot;)print(response)  # &quot;Hello there!&quot;```If your bot does not understand the input text, it will return a default response. You can set this response by calling the `set_no_response_message` method:```pythonbot.set_no_response_message(&quot;I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.&quot;)```### Training ToggleYou can enable or disable training by calling the `enable_training` or `disable_training` methods:```pythonbot.enable_training()bot.disable_training()```## ExamplesHere are some examples of how to use OrionBot:### Example 1: Simple greeting bot```pythonfrom orionbot import Chatbotbot = Chatbot(&quot;Greeting Bot&quot;)bot.train(&quot;Hi&quot;, &quot;Hello there!&quot;)bot.train(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Hi there!&quot;)bot.train(&quot;Hey&quot;, &quot;Hiya!&quot;)print(bot.get_response(&quot;Hi&quot;))  # &quot;Hello there!&quot;print(bot.get_response(&quot;Hey&quot;))  # &quot;Hiya!&quot;print(bot.get_response(&quot;What's up?&quot;))  # &quot;I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.&quot;```### Example 2: Movie recommendation bot```pythonfrom orionbot import Chatbotbot = Chatbot(&quot;Movie Bot&quot;)bot.train(&quot;What's a good movie to watch?&quot;, &quot;I recommend watching The Shawshank Redemption.&quot;)bot.train(&quot;What's your favorite movie?&quot;, &quot;My favorite movie is The Godfather.&quot;)bot.train(&quot;Have you seen Inception?&quot;, &quot;Yes, Inception is a great movie!&quot;)print(bot.get_response(&quot;What's a good movie to watch?&quot;))  # &quot;I recommend watching The Shawshank Redemption.&quot;print(bot.get_response(&quot;What's your favorite movie?&quot;))  # &quot;My favorite movie is The Godfather.&quot;print(bot.get_response(&quot;Have you seen The Matrix?&quot;))  # &quot;I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.&quot;```You can find more information on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LyubomirT/OrionBot)## Table of Contents  - [Overview](README.md) - [Training Guide](TRAINING.md) - [The Chatbot class](CHATBOTCLASS.md) - [Preprocessing Method](PREPROCESSING.md) - [Training Method](TRAINMETHOD.md) - [Train from an existing dataset](DATASETTRAINING.md) - [Training Mode](TRAININGMODE.md) - [&quot;No Response Message&quot;](NORESPONSE.md)</longdescription>
