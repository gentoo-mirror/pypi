Want to get scared because of impact you are having on the evironment while doing &quot;valuable&quot; research? Are you interested in knowing how much carbon you are burning playing with DALL-E just to get attention on twitter? If the thing that was missing from your machine learning workflow was existential dread, this is the correct package for you!perun is python package that calculates the energy consumption of your python scripts by sampling usage statistics from Intel RAPL, Nvidia-NVML and *psutil*. Unlike other energy measuring applications out there, this is the only one capable of handling MPI applications, being capable of gathering data from 100s of nodes at the same time, and accumulating it efficiently. This is posible without adding any line of code into your existing application, and without meaningfully extending the runtime of your application.## InstallationFrom PyPI:```consolepip install perun```From Github:```consolepip install git+https://github.com/Helmholtz-AI-Energy/perun```## Quick StartPerun has two usage methods, either using the command line, or using function decorators.### Command lineWhen using the command line, perun will output file containing runtime, energy and other information gathered while your script runs.```console$ perun monitor path/to/your/script.py [args]$ cat perun_results/script_2023-03-23T12:10:48.627214.txtPERUN REPORTApp name: scriptRun ID: 2023-03-23T12:10:48.627214RUNTIME: 0:00:06.333626 sCPU_UTIL: 64.825 %MEM_UTIL: 0.563 %NET_READ: 1.401 kBNET_WRITE: 1.292 kBDISK_READ: 174.633 MBDISK_WRITE: 88.000 kB```### DecoratorPerun can also monitor individual functions using a decorator:```pythonimport timefrom perun.decorator import monitor@monitor()def your_sleep_function(n: int):    time.sleep(n)```And then running your script like always:```consolepython path/to/your/script.py```&gt; :exclamation: Each time the function is run, perun will output a new report from the function.### MPIIf your python application uses mpi4py, you don't need to change anything. Perun is able to handle MPI applications, and will gather statistics in all the utilized nodes.```consolempirun -n 8 perun monitor path/to/your/script.py```or```mpirun -n 8 python path/to/your/script.py```## Usage### SubcommandsPerun subcommands have some shared options that are typed before the subcommands.```consoleUsage: perun [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...  Perun: Energy measuring and reporting tool.Options:  --version                       Show the version and exit.  -c, --configuration FILE        Path to configuration file  -n, --app_name TEXT             Name of the monitored application. The name                                  is used to distinguish between multiple                                  applications in the same directory. If left                                  empty, the filename will be  used.  -i, --run_id TEXT               Unique id of the latest run of the                                  application. If left empty, perun will use                                  the SLURM job id, or the current date.  --format [text|json|hdf5|pickle|csv|bench]                                  Report format.  --data_out DIRECTORY            Where to save the output files, defaults to                                  the current working directory.  --raw                           Use the flag '--raw' if you need access to                                  all the raw data collected by perun. The                                  output will be saved on an hdf5 file on the                                  perun data output location.  --sampling_rate FLOAT           Sampling rate in seconds.  --pue FLOAT                     Data center Power Usage Efficiency.  --emissions_factor FLOAT        Emissions factor at compute resource                                  location.  --price_factor FLOAT            Electricity price factor at compute resource                                  location.  --bench                         Activate benchmarking mode.  --bench_rounds INTEGER          Number of rounds per function/app.  --bench_warmup_rounds INTEGER   Number of warmup rounds per function/app.  -l, --log_lvl [DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR|CRITICAL]                                  Loggging level  --help                          Show this message and exit.Commands:  export    Export existing perun output file to another format.  monitor   Gather power consumption from hardware devices while SCRIPT...  sensors   Print sensors assigned to each rank by perun.  showconf  Print current perun configuration in INI format.```### monitorMonitor energy usage of a python script.```consoleUsage: perun monitor [OPTIONS] SCRIPT [SCRIPT_ARGS]...

The options are shown in the command line section. The options can also be passed as environmental variables by adding the prefix 'PERUN' to them. Ex. &quot;--format txt&quot; -&gt; PERUN_FORMAT=txt- Local INI file  Perun will look into the cwd for &quot;.perun.ini&quot; file, where options can be fixed for the directory.  Example:  ```ini  [post-processing]  pue = 1.58  emissions_factor = 0.262  price_factor = 34.6  [monitor]  sampling_rate = 1  [output]  app_name  run_id  format = text  data_out = ./perun_results  depth  raw = False  [benchmarking]  bench_enable = False  bench_rounds = 10  bench_warmup_rounds = 1  [debug]  log_lvl = ERROR  ```  The location of the file can be changed using the option &quot;-c&quot; or &quot;PERUN_CONFIGURATION&quot;.- Global INI file  If the file ~/.config/perun.ini is found, perun will override the default configuration with the contents of the file.### PriorityCMD LINE and ENV &gt; Local INI &gt; Global INI &gt; Default options## Data Output StructureWhen exporting data to machine readable formats like json, pickle, and hdf5, perun stores the data in a hierarchical format, with the application and individual runs at the root of data tree, and individual sensors and raw data a in the leafs. When processing, the data is propagated from the leafs (sensors), all the way to the root, where a aggregated statistics about the application are gatherd.&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Helmholtz-AI-Energy/perun/main/docs/images/data_structure.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</longdescription>
