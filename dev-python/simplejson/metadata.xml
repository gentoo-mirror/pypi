	<longdescription>simplejson----------simplejson is a simple, fast, complete, correct and extensibleJSON &lt;http://json.org&gt; encoder and decoder for Python 3.3+with legacy support for Python 2.5+.  It is pure Python codewith no dependencies, but includes an optional C extensionfor a serious speed boost.The latest documentation for simplejson can be read online here:https://simplejson.readthedocs.io/simplejson is the externally maintained development version of thejson library included with Python (since 2.6). This version is testedwith the latest Python 3.8 and maintains backwards compatibilitywith Python 3.3+ and the legacy Python 2.5 - Python 2.7 releases.The encoder can be specialized to provide serialization in any kind ofsituation, without any special support by the objects to be serialized(somewhat like pickle). This is best done with the ``default`` kwargto dumps.The decoder can handle incoming JSON strings of any specified encoding(UTF-8 by default). It can also be specialized to post-process JSONobjects with the ``object_hook`` or ``object_pairs_hook`` kwargs. Thisis particularly useful for implementing protocols such as JSON-RPCthat have a richer type system than JSON itself.For those of you that have legacy systems to maintain, there is avery old fork of simplejson in the `python2.2`_ branch that supportsPython 2.2. This is based on a very old version of simplejson,is not maintained, and should only be used as a last resort... _python2.2: https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/tree/python2.2</longdescription>
