	<longdescription># Download and load spaCy models on-the-flyA tiny drop-in replacement for `spacy.load()` that automatically downloads a model when it is not currently installed.```shellpip install spacy_download```Usage is identical to [`spacy.load()`](https://spacy.io/api/top-level/#spacy.load), meaning that you can also excludeor disable pipeline components. Example:```pythonfrom spacy_download import load_spacy# Will download the model if it isn't installed yetnlp = load_spacy(&quot;en_core_web_sm&quot;, exclude=[&quot;parser&quot;, &quot;tagger&quot;])  ```Under the hood, the package makes use of spaCy's capability to import models as modules, rather than using spaCy'sbuilt-in loader. This allows us to first download a model with `pip` and then load it as a module.**Note**: if you are using transformer models, you still need to install `spacy-transformers` yourself!**WARNING**: loading models on the fly can be useful, but it is[not an officially supported feature](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/discussions/10608). It should work fine withthe official models at the time of writing, but I cannot guarantee that this will always be the case.Use at your own risk.</longdescription>
