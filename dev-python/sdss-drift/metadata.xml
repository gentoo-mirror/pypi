The code is a relatively thin wrapper around [Pymodbus](http://riptideio.github.io/pymodbus/) with the main feature being that it's possible to define a PLC controller and a complete set of modules as a YAML configuration file which can then be loaded. It also provides convenience methods to read and write to the I/O modules and to convert the read values to physical units.This code is mostly intended to interface with the SDSS-V [FPS](https://www.sdss.org/future/technology/) electronic boxes but is probably general enough for other uses. It's originally based on Rick Pogge's [WAGO code](https://github.com/sdss/FPS/tree/master/WAGO).## InstallationTo install, run```consolepip install sdss-drift```To install from source, git clone or download the code, navigate to the root of the downloaded directory, and do```consolepip install .````sdss-drift` uses [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) for development. To install it in development mode do```consolepoetry install -E docs```## DocumentationRefer to the Read the Docs [documentation](https://sdss-drift.readthedocs.io/en/latest) for more details.</longdescription>
