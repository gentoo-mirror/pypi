	<longdescription># localstack-s3-pyspark[![test-distribute](https://github.com/enorganic/localstack-s3-pyspark/actions/workflows/test-distribute.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/enorganic/localstack-s3-pyspark/actions/workflows/test-distribute.yml)This package provides a CLI for configuring pyspark to use[localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) for the S3 file system.This is intended for testing packages locally (or in your CI/CD pipeline)which you intend to deploy on an Amazon EMR cluster.## InstallationExecute the following command, replacing **pip3** with the executableappropriate for the environment where you want to configure **pyspark** to use**localstack**:```shellpip3 install localstack-s3-pyspark```## Configure Spark's DefaultsIf you've installed **localstack-s3-pyspark** in a Dockerfile or virtualenvironment, just run the following command:```shelllocalstack-s3-pyspark configure-defaults```If you've installed **localstack-s3-pyspark** in an environment with multiplepython 3.x versions, you may instead want to run an appropriate variation ofthe following command (replacing `python3` with the command used to access thepython executable for which you want to configure pyspark):```shellpython3 -m localstack_s3_pyspark configure-defaults```### ToxPlease note that if you are testing your packages with **tox** (highlyrecommended), you will need to:- Include &quot;localstack-s3-pyspark&quot; in your tox **deps**- Include `localstack-s3-pyspark configure-defaults` in your tox  **commands_pre** (or by other means execute this command prior to your tests)Here is an example **tox.ini** which starts up localstack using the localstackCLI (you could also use `docker-compose` or just `docker run`, if you need greater control or fewer python dependencies, see the the localstackdocumentation[&quot;Getting Started&quot; page](https://docs.localstack.cloud/get-started)for details):```ini[tox]envlist = pytest[testenv:pytest]deps =  localstack-s3-pyspark  localstackcommands_pre =    localstack-s3-pyspark configure-defaults    localstack start -d    sleep 20commands =    py.testcommands_post =    localstack stop```## Patch *boto3*If your tests interact with S3 using **boto3**, you can patch boto3 from withinyour unit tests as follows:```python3from localstack_s3_pyspark.boto3 import use_localstackuse_localstack()```</longdescription>
