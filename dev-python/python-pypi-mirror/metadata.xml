	<longdescription>``pypi-mirror`` is a small script to generate a partial PyPI mirror. Itrelies on ``pip`` to do the most difficult part of the job (downloadinga package and its dependencies).Why?====Because most of the time you don't need a full PyPI mirror but only amirror that contains the packages you use. If you want a full PyPImirror you should look at `bandersnatch`_.Installation============You can install ``pypi-mirror`` using ``pip``:.. code:: sh   pip install python-pypi-mirrorOr using ``conda``:.. code:: sh    conda install -c conda-forge python-pypi-mirror How to use it?==============The script provides several commands to manage your mirror. To find outwhich commands are available, type:.. code:: sh   pypi-mirror --helpEvery command provides its own help message. So for example to get thehelp message of the ``download`` command, type:.. code:: sh   pypi-mirror download --helpThe commands that you will probably use the most are the ``download``command and the ``create`` command. For example to create a mirror whichcontains the ``requests`` package and its dependencies, you can type thefollowing:.. code:: sh   pypi-mirror download -d downloads requests   pypi-mirror create -d downloads -m simpleThe first command will create a ``downloads`` directory into the currentdirectory and use ``pip`` to download the ``requests`` package and itsdependencies into the newly created directory. Then the ``create``command will create a ``simple`` directory into the current directoryand will build the mirror inside this newly created directory. You canadd new packages by repeating this sequence of commands.To make your mirror available through HTTP, you can point your HTTPserver of choice to the ``simple`` directory. For exemple, type thefollowing command into the current directory:.. code:: sh   python3 -m http.serverIt will start a HTTP server that will serve file from the currentdirectory (which should contains the ``downloads`` directory and the``simple`` directory). You can then install packages using your brandnew mirror using the following command:.. code:: sh   pip install -i http://127.0.0.1:8000/simple requestsAbout versioning================This package use `semver`_ to manage version numbering. It means thatevery times the major number is increased a backward incompatiblechange has been introduced in the API (the command line is an API). Sobe careful when upgrading to a new major release as it will surelybreak your scripts... _bandersnatch: https://github.com/pypa/bandersnatch.git.. _semver: https://semver.org/</longdescription>
