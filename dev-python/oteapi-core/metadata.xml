and* An efficient data cache module that avoids downloading the same content several times.## Types of strategies### Download strategyDownload strategy patterns use a given protocol to download content into the data cache.They are configured with the `ResourceConfig` data model, using the scheme of the `downloadUrl` field for strategy selection.The `configuration` field can be used to configure how the downloaded content is stored in the cache using the `DownloadConfig` data model.Standard downloaded strategies: *file*, *https*, *http*, *sftp*, *ftp*### Parse strategyParse strategy patterns convert content from the data cache to a Python dict.Like download strategies, they are configured with the `ResourceConfig` data model, using the `mediaType` field for strategy selection.Additional strategy-specific configurations can be provided via the `configuration` field.Standard parse strategies: *application/json*, *image/jpg*, *image/jpeg*, *image/jp2*, *image/png*, *image/gif*, *image/tiff*, *image/eps*, *application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet*, *application/vnd.sqlite3*### Resource strategyResource strategy patterns can retrieve/upload data to external data services.They are configured with the `ResourceConfig` data model, using the scheme of the `accessUrl` and `accessService` fields.The scheme of the `accessUrl` is used for strategy selection.### Mapping strategyStrategies for mapping fields/properties in data models to ontological concepts.### Filter strategyFilter strategies can update the configuration of other strategies.They can also update values in the data cache.Standard filter strategies: *filter/crop*, *filter/sql*### Function strategyFunction strategies are synchronous transformations that (normally) run directly on the server hosting the OTE service.### Transformation strategyTransformation strategies are a special form of a function strategy intended for long-running transformations.In this sense, they represent asynchronous functions running in the background or on external resources.Standard transformation strategies: *celery/remote*The transformation strategy has consolidated the execution of thetransformation with the `get()` method to unify the strategy interfaces.`get()` is intended to start an asynchronous process and return a*task_id* which can be queried using the `status()` method (outside of a pipeline).## Entry points for pluginsThe way strategies are registered and found is through [entry points](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/).Special group names allow understanding the strategy type and the entry point values allow understanding of what kind of strategy a specific class implements.A full overview of recognized entry point group names can be seen in [Table of entry point strategies](#table-of-entry-point-strategies).### Defining entry pointsIn the following examples, let's imagine we have a package importable in Python through `my_plugin` and contains two download strategies and a single parse strategy:1. A peer-2-peer download strategy, implemented in a class named `Peer2PeerDownload` importable from `my_plugin.strategies.download.peer_2_peer`.2. A MongoDB download strategy, implemented in a class named `MongoRetrieve` importable from `my_plugin.strategies.mongo`.3. A MongoDB parse strategy, implemented in a class named `MongoParse` importable from `my_plugin.strategies.mongo`.There are now various different ways to let the Python environment know of these strategies through entry points.#### `setup.py`In the package's `setup.py` file, one can specify entry points.  Here, an example snippet is shown using [setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/):```python# setup.pyfrom setuptools import setupsetup(    # ...,    entry_points={        &quot;oteapi.download&quot;: [            &quot;my_plugin.p2p = my_plugin.strategies.download.peer_2_peer:Peer2PeerDownload&quot;,            &quot;my_plugin.mongo = my_plugin.strategies.mongo:MongoRetrieve&quot;,        ],        &quot;oteapi.parse&quot;: [            &quot;my_plugin.application/vnd.mongo+json = my_plugin.strategies.mongo:MongoParse&quot;,        ]    },)```#### YAML/JSON custom filesUse custom files that are later parsed and used in a `setup.py` file.```yamlentry_points:  oteapi.download:  - &quot;my_plugin.p2p = my_plugin.strategies.download.peer_2_peer:Peer2PeerDownload&quot;  - &quot;my_plugin.mongo = my_plugin.strategies.mongo:MongoRetrieve&quot;  oteapi.parse:  - &quot;my_plugin.application/vnd.mongo+json = my_plugin.strategies.mongo:MongoParse&quot;``````json{  &quot;entry_points&quot;: {    &quot;oteapi.download&quot;: [      &quot;my_plugin.p2p = my_plugin.strategies.download.peer_2_peer:Peer2PeerDownload&quot;,      &quot;my_plugin.mongo = my_plugin.strategies.mongo:MongoRetrieve&quot;    ],    &quot;oteapi.parse&quot;: [      &quot;my_plugin.application/vnd.mongo+json = my_plugin.strategies.mongo:MongoParse&quot;    ]  }}```#### `setup.cfg`/`pyproject.toml`A more modern approach is to use `setup.cfg` or `pyproject.toml`.```ini[options.entry_points]oteapi.download =    my_plugin.p2p = my_plugin.strategies.download.peer_2_peer:Peer2PeerDownload    my_plugin.mongo = my_plugin.strategies.mongo:MongoRetrieveoteapi.parse =    my_plugin.application/vnd.mongo+json = my_plugin.strategies.mongo:MongoParse```### Syntax and semanticsAs seen above, there are a few different syntactical flavors of how to list the entry points.However, the &quot;value&quot; stays the same throughout.#### General Python entry pointsThe general syntax for entry points is based on `ini` files and parsed using the built-in `configparser` module described [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#module-configparser).Specifically for entry points the nomenclature is the following:```ini[options.entry_points]GROUP =    NAME = VALUE```The `VALUE` is then further split into: `PACKAGE.MODULE:OBJECT.ATTRIBUTE [EXTRA1, EXTRA2]`.#### OTEAPI strategy entry pointsFrom the general syntax outlined above, OTEAPI Core then implements rules and requirements regarding the syntax for strategies.1. A class *MUST* be specified (as an `OBJECT`).2. The `NAME` *MUST* consist of exactly two parts: `PACKAGE` and strategy type value in the form of `PACKAGE.STRATEGY_TYPE_VALUE`.3. The `GROUP` *MUST* be a valid OTEAPI entry point group, see [Table of entry point strategies](#table-of-entry-point-strategies) for a full list of valid OTEAPI entry point group values.To understand what the strategy type value should be, see [Table of entry point strategies](#table-of-entry-point-strategies).### Table of entry point strategies| Strategy Type Name | Strategy Type Value | Entry Point Group | Documentation Reference ||:---:|:---:|:---:|:--- || Download | [`scheme`](oteapi/models/resourceconfig.py) | `oteapi.download` | [Download strategy](#download-strategy) || Filter | [`filterType`](oteapi/models/filterconfig.py) | `oteapi.filter` | [Filter strategy](#filter-strategy) || Function | [`functionType`](oteapi/models/functionconfig.py) | `oteapi.function` | [Function strategy](#function-strategy) || Mapping | [`mappingType`](oteapi/models/mappingconfig.py) | `oteapi.mapping` | [Mapping strategy](#mapping-strategy) || Parse | [`mediaType`](oteapi/models/resourceconfig.py) | `oteapi.parse` | [Parse strategy](#parse-strategy) || Resource | [`accessService`](oteapi/models/resourceconfig.py) | `oteapi.resource` | [Resource strategy](#resource-strategy) || Transformation | [`transformationType`](oteapi/models/transformationconfig.py) | `oteapi.transformation` | [Transformation strategy](#transformation-strategy) |## Other OTEAPI-related repositories* [OTEAPI Services](https://github.com/EMMC-ASBL/oteapi-services) - a RESTful interface to OTEAPI Core* [OTELib](https://github.com/EMMC-ASBL/otelib) - a Python interface to OTEAPI Services* [OTEAPI Plugin Template](https://github.com/EMMC-ASBL/oteapi-plugin-template) - a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) template for OTEAPI Plugins## InstallationOTEAPI Core can be installed with:```shellpip install oteapi-core```### For developersIf you want to install OTEAPI Core to have a developer environment, please clone down the repository from GitHub and install:```shellgit clone https://github.com/EMMC-ASBL/oteapi-core /path/to/oteapi-corepip install -U --upgrade-strategy=eager -e /path/to/oteapi-core[dev]```Note, `/path/to/oteapi-core` can be left out of the first line, but then it must be updated in the second line, either to `./oteapi-core`/`oteapi-core` or `.` if you `cd` into the generated folder wherein the repository has been cloned.The `--upgrade-strategy=eager` part can be left out.We recommend installing within a dedicated virtual environment.To test the installation, you can run:```shellcd /path/to/oteapi-corepytest```If you run into issues at this stage, please [open an issue](https://github.com/EMMC-ASBL/oteapi-core/issues/new).## LicenseOTEAPI Core is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE) with copyright &amp;copy; SINTEF.## AcknowledgmentOTEAPI Core has been supported by the following projects:* __OntoTrans__ (2020-2024) that receives funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, under Grant Agreement no. 862136.* __VIPCOAT__ (2021-2025) receives funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme - DT-NMBP-11-2020 Open Innovation Platform for Materials Modelling, under Grant Agreement no: 952903.* __OpenModel__ (2021-2025) receives funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme - DT-NMBP-11-2020 Open Innovation Platform for Materials Modelling, under Grant Agreement no: 953167.</longdescription>
