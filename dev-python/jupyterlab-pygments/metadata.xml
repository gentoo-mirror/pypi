Supported versions for `@jupyterlab/codemirror`'s CSS include `0.19.1`, `^1.0`, and, `^2.0`.## LimitationsPygments-generated HTML and CSS classes are not granular enough to reproduceall of the details of codemirror (the JavaScript text editor used by JupyterLab).This includes the ability to differentiate properties from general names.## License`jupyterlab_pygments` uses a shared copyright model that enables all contributors to maintain thecopyright on their contributions. All code is licensed under the terms of the revised [BSD license](LICENSE).</longdescription>
