	<longdescription># CodeZen## DescriptionCodeZen is a CLI utility that uses LLMs to help you debug and evolve your codebase based on your requests.Usage examples:```bashcodezen &quot;Why am I getting &lt;some exception message&gt;?&quot;codezen &quot;Write a README.md file for this project&quot;```The differences from Github Copilot:* This is a CLI tool, meaning it can be used regardless of your chosen IDE.* This provides the LLM with the entire codebase, so it can do things that require a more holistic view of your project.Current limitations:* Only works for small codebases- currently it sends the entire codebase on each request (except the ignored files). ðŸ˜†* It can't change files autonomously, it only offers a solution.* It uses gitignore file to know which files to ignore, so you must run this in a git repo and you can't currently ignore files that don't appear there.## Installation### Using PyPiYou can install the application using `pip` or `pipx`:```bashpip install --user codezen```or```bashpipx install codezen```### Compile from sourceYou can compile directly from source:```bashgit clone https://github.com/mmaorc/codezencd codezenpoetry build```### DevelopmentFor development purposes, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and install it in a virtual environment:```bashgit clone https://github.com/mmaorc/codezencd codezenpoetry installpoetry shell```## UsageBefore running the script, ensure that the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set up correctly.Run CodeZen with the following command:```bashcodezen &lt;issue_description&gt;````&lt;issue_description&gt;`: Describe the issue you are facing with your codeIf you want to ignore additional files without adding them to your `.gitignore`, You can create a `.czignore` file at the project's root and add them there.If you want to estimate the number of used tokens and show the files that are included in the prompt you can use:``` bashcodezen &lt;issue_description&gt; --estimate```## ContributingIf you would like to contribute to this project, please feel free to fork the repository, create a feature branch, and submit a pull request.## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
