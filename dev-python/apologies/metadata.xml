On UNIX-like platforms, it includes a console demo that plays the game with automated players, intended for use by developers and not by end users.  See the [documentation](https://apologies.readthedocs.io/en/stable) for notes about the public interface.It was written as a learning exercise and technology demonstration effort, andserves as a complete example of how to manage a modern (circa 2020) Pythonproject, including style checks, code formatting, integration with IntelliJ, CIbuilds at GitHub, and integration with PyPI and Read the Docs.</longdescription>
