Enables consumer driven contract testing,providing a mock service and DSL for the consumer project, andinteraction playback and verification for the service provider project.Currently supports version 2 of the [Pact specification].For more information about what Pact is, and how it can help youtest your code more efficiently, check out the [Pact documentation].Note: As of Version 1.0 deprecates support for python 2.7 to allow us to incorporate python 3.x features more readily. If you want to still use Python 2.7 use the 0.x.y versions. Only bug fixes will now be added to that release.# How to use pact-python## Installation```pip install pact-python```## Getting started&lt;!-- Absolute link for rendering page in docs.pact.io --&gt;A guide follows but if you go to the [examples](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python/tree/master/examples). This has a consumer, provider and pact-broker set of tests for both FastAPI and Flask.## Writing a PactCreating a complete contract is a two step process:1. Create a test on the consumer side that declares the expectations it has of the provider2. Create a provider state that allows the contract to pass when replayed against the provider## Writing the Consumer TestIf we have a method that communicates with one of our external services, which we'll call`Provider`, and our product, `Consumer` is hitting an endpoint on `Provider` at`/users/&lt;user&gt;` to get information about a particular user.If the code to fetch a user looked like this:```pythonimport requestsdef user(user_name):    &quot;&quot;&quot;Fetch a user object by user_name from the server.&quot;&quot;&quot;    uri = 'http://localhost:1234/users/' + user_name    return requests.get(uri).json()```Then `Consumer`'s contract test might look something like this:```pythonimport atexitimport unittestfrom pact import Consumer, Providerpact = Consumer('Consumer').has_pact_with(Provider('Provider'))pact.start_service()atexit.register(pact.stop_service)class GetUserInfoContract(unittest.TestCase):  def test_get_user(self):    expected = {      'username': 'UserA',      'id': 123,      'groups': ['Editors']    }    (pact     .given('UserA exists and is not an administrator')     .upon_receiving('a request for UserA')     .with_request('get', '/users/UserA')     .will_respond_with(200, body=expected))    with pact:      result = user('UserA')    self.assertEqual(result, expected)```This does a few important things: - Defines the Consumer and Provider objects that describe our product and our service under test - Uses `given` to define the setup criteria for the Provider `UserA exists and is not an administrator` - Defines what the request that is expected to be made by the consumer will contain - Defines how the server is expected to respondUsing the Pact object as a [context manager], we call our method under testwhich will then communicate with the Pact mock service. The mock service will respond withthe items we defined, allowing us to assert that the method processed the response andreturned the expected value. If you want more control over when the mock service isconfigured and the interactions verified, use the `setup` and `verify` methods, respectively:```python   (pact     .given('UserA exists and is not an administrator')     .upon_receiving('a request for UserA')     .with_request('get', '/users/UserA')     .will_respond_with(200, body=expected))    pact.setup()    # Some additional steps before running the code under test    result = user('UserA')    # Some additional steps before verifying all interactions have occurred    pact.verify()```### RequestsWhen defining the expected HTTP request that your code is expected to make youcan specify the method, path, body, headers, and query:```pythonpact.with_request(    method='GET',    path='/api/v1/my-resources/',    query={'search': 'example'})````query` is used to specify URL query parameters, so the above example expectsa request made to `/api/v1/my-resources/?search=example`.```pythonpact.with_request(    method='POST',    path='/api/v1/my-resources/123',    body={'user_ids': [1, 2, 3]},    headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'},)```You can define exact values for your expected request like the examples above,or you can use the matchers defined later to assist in handling values that arevariable.The default hostname and port for the Pact mock service will be`localhost:1234` but you can adjust this during Pact creation:```pythonfrom pact import Consumer, Providerpact = Consumer('Consumer').has_pact_with(    Provider('Provider'), host_name='mockservice', port=8080)```This can be useful if you need to run to create more than one Pact for your testbecause your code interacts with two different services. It is important to notethat the code you are testing with this contract _must_ contact the mock service.So in this example, the `user` method could accept an argument to specify thelocation of the server, or retrieve it from an environment variable so you canchange its URI during the test.The mock service offers you several important features when building your contracts:- It provides a real HTTP server that your code can contact during the test and provides the responses you defined.- You provide it with the expectations for the request your code will make and it will assert the contents of the actual requests made based on your expectations.- If a request is made that does not match one you defined or if a request from your code is missing it will return an error with details.- Finally, it will record your contracts as a JSON file that you can store in your repository or publish to a Pact broker.## Expecting Variable ContentThe above test works great if that user information is always static, but what happens ifthe user has a last updated field that is set to the current time every time the object ismodified? To handle variable data and make your tests more robust, there are 3 helpful matchers:### Term(matcher, generate)Asserts the value should match the given regular expression. You could use thisto expect a timestamp with a particular format in the request or response whereyou know you need a particular format, but are unconcerned about the exact date:```pythonfrom pact import Term...body = {    'username': 'UserA',    'last_modified': Term('\d+-\d+-\d+T\d+:\d+:\d+', '2016-12-15T20:16:01')}(pact .given('UserA exists and is not an administrator') .upon_receiving('a request for UserA') .with_request('get', '/users/UserA/info') .will_respond_with(200, body=body))```When you run the tests for the consumer, the mock service will return the value you providedas `generate`, in this case `2016-12-15T20:16:01`. When the contract is verified on theprovider, the regex will be used to search the response from the real provider serviceand the test will be considered successful if the regex finds a match in the response.### Like(matcher)Asserts the element's type matches the matcher. For example:```pythonfrom pact import LikeLike(123)  # Matches if the value is an integerLike('hello world')  # Matches if the value is a stringLike(3.14)  # Matches if the value is a float```The argument supplied to `Like` will be what the mock service responds with.When a dictionary is used as an argument for Like, all the child objects (and their child objects etc.) will be matched according to their types, unless you use a more specific matcher like a Term.```pythonfrom pact import Like, TermLike({    'username': Term('[a-zA-Z]+', 'username'),    'id': 123, # integer    'confirmed': False, # boolean    'address': { # dictionary        'street': '200 Bourke St' # string    }})```### EachLike(matcher, minimum=1)Asserts the value is an array type that consists of elementslike the one passed in. It can be used to assert simple arrays:```pythonfrom pact import EachLikeEachLike(1)  # All items are integersEachLike('hello')  # All items are strings```Or other matchers can be nested inside to assert more complex objects:```pythonfrom pact import EachLike, TermEachLike({    'username': Term('[a-zA-Z]+', 'username'),    'id': 123,    'groups': EachLike('administrators')})```&gt; Note, you do not need to specify everything that will be returned from the Provider in a&gt; JSON response, any extra data that is received will be ignored and the tests will still pass.&gt; Note, to get the generated values from an object that can contain matchers like Term, Like, EachLike, etc.&gt; for assertion in self.assertEqual(result, expected) you may need to use get_generated_values() helper function:```pythonfrom pact.matchers import get_generated_valuesself.assertEqual(result, get_generated_values(expected))```### Match common formatsOften times, you find yourself having to re-write regular expressions for common formats.```pythonfrom pact import FormatFormat().integer  # Matches if the value is an integerFormat().ip_address  # Matches if the value is an ip address```We've created a number of them for you to save you the time:| matcher           | description                                                                                                             ||-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| `identifier`      | Match an ID (e.g. 42)                                                                                                   || `integer`         | Match all numbers that are integers (both ints and longs)                                                               || `decimal`         | Match all real numbers (floating point and decimal)                                                                     || `hexadecimal`     | Match all hexadecimal encoded strings                                                                                   || `date`            | Match string containing basic ISO8601 dates (e.g. 2016-01-01)                                                           || `timestamp`       | Match a string containing an RFC3339 formatted timestamp (e.g. Mon, 31 Oct 2016 15:21:41 -0400)                         || `time`            | Match string containing times in ISO date format (e.g. T22:44:30.652Z)                                                  || `iso_datetime`    | Match string containing ISO 8601 formatted dates (e.g. 2015-08-06T16:53:10+01:00)                                       || `iso_datetime_ms` | Match string containing ISO 8601 formatted dates, enforcing millisecond precision (e.g. 2015-08-06T16:53:10.123+01:00)  || `ip_address`      | Match string containing IP4 formatted address                                                                           || `ipv6_address`    | Match string containing IP6 formatted address                                                                           || `uuid`            | Match strings containing UUIDs                                                                                          |These can be used to replace other matchers```pythonfrom pact import Like, FormatLike({    'id': Format().integer, # integer    'lastUpdated': Format().timestamp, # timestamp    'location': { # dictionary        'host': Format().ip_address # ip address    }})```For more information see [Matching](https://docs.pact.io/getting_started/matching)## Uploading pact files to a Pact BrokerThere are two ways to publish your pact files, to a Pact Broker.1. [Pact CLI tools](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/client_cli) **recommended**2. Pact Python API### CLISee [Publishing and retrieving pacts](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/publishing_and_retrieving_pacts)Example uploading to a Pact Broker```pact-broker publish /path/to/pacts/consumer-provider.json --consumer-app-version 1.0.0 --branch main --broker-base-url https://test.pactflow.io --broker-username someUsername --broker-password somePassword```Example uploading to a PactFlow Broker```pact-broker publish /path/to/pacts/consumer-provider.json --consumer-app-version 1.0.0 --branch main --broker-base-url https://test.pactflow.io --broker-token SomeToken```### Python API```pythonbroker = Broker(broker_base_url=&quot;http://localhost&quot;)broker.publish(&quot;TestConsumer&quot;,                       &quot;2.0.1&quot;,                       branch='consumer-branch',                       pact_dir='.')output, logs = verifier.verify_pacts('./userserviceclient-userservice.json')```The parameters for this differ slightly in naming from their CLI equivalents:| CLI                               |      native Python                ||-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|| `--branch`                        | `branch`                          || `--build-url`                     | `build_url`                       || `--auto-detect-version-properties`| `auto_detect_version_properties`  || `--tag=TAG`                       | `consumer_tags`                   || `--tag-with-git-branch`           | `tag_with_git_branch`             || `PACT_DIRS_OR_FILES`              | `pact_dir`                        || `--consumer-app-version`          | `version`                         || `n/a`                             | `consumer_name`                   |## Verifying Pacts Against a ServiceIn addition to writing Pacts for Python consumers, you can also verify those Pactsagainst a provider of any language. There are two ways to do this.### CLIAfter installing pact-python a `pact-verifier`application should be available. To get details about its use you can call it with thehelp argument:```bashpact-verifier --help```The simplest example is verifying a server with locally stored Pact files and no providerstates:```bashpact-verifier --provider-base-url=http://localhost:8080 --pact-url=./pacts/consumer-provider.json```Which will immediately invoke the Pact verifier, making HTTP requests to the server locatedat `http://localhost:8080` based on the Pacts in `./pacts/consumer-provider.json` andreporting the results.There are several options for configuring how the Pacts are verified:###### --provider-base-urlRequired. Defines the URL of the server to make requests to when verifying the Pacts.###### --pact-urlRequired if --pact-urls not specified. The location of a Pact file you wantto verify. This can be a URL to a [Pact Broker] or a local path, to providemultiple files, specify multiple arguments.```pact-verifier --provider-base-url=http://localhost:8080 --pact-url=./pacts/one.json --pact-url=./pacts/two.json```###### --pact-urlsRequired if --pact-url not specified. The location of the Pact files you wantto verify. This can be a URL to a [Pact Broker] or one or more local paths, separated by a comma.###### --provider-states-url_DEPRECATED AFTER v 0.6.0._ The URL where your provider application will produce the list of available provider states.The verifier calls this URL to ensure the Pacts specify valid states before making the HTTPrequests.###### --provider-states-setup-urlThe URL which should be called to setup a specific provider state before a Pact is verified. This URL will be called with a POST request, and the JSON body `{consumer: 'Consumer name', state: 'a thing exists'}`.###### --pact-broker-urlBase URl for the Pact Broker instance to publish pacts to. Can also be specified via the environment variable`PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL`.###### --pact-broker-usernameThe username to use when contacting the Pact Broker. Can also be specified via the environment variable`PACT_BROKER_USERNAME`.###### --pact-broker-passwordThe password to use when contacting the Pact Broker. You can also specify this valueas the environment variable `PACT_BROKER_PASSWORD`.###### --pact-broker-tokenThe bearer token to use when contacting the Pact Broker. You can also specify this valueas the environment variable `PACT_BROKER_TOKEN`.###### --consumer-version-tagRetrieve the latest pacts with this consumer version tag. Used in conjunction with `--provider`.May be specified multiple times.###### --consumer-version-selectorYou can also retrieve pacts with consumer version selector, a more flexible approach in specifying which pacts you need.May be specified multiple times. Read more about selectors [here](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/advanced_topics/consumer_version_selectors/).###### --provider-version-tagTag to apply to the provider application version. May be specified multiple times.###### --provider-version-branchBranch to apply to the provider application version.###### --custom-provider-headerHeader to add to provider state set up and pact verification requests e.g.`Authorization: Basic cGFjdDpwYWN0`May be specified multiple times.###### -t, --timeoutThe duration in seconds we should wait to confirm that the verification process was successful. Defaults to 30.###### -a, --provider-app-versionThe provider application version. Required for publishing verification results.###### -r, --publish-verification-resultsPublish verification results to the broker.### Python APIYou can use the Verifier class. This allows you to write native python code and the test framework of your choice.```pythonverifier = Verifier(provider='UserService',                    provider_base_url=PACT_URL)# Using a local pact filesuccess, logs = verifier.verify_pacts('./userserviceclient-userservice.json')assert success == 0# Using a pact broker- For OSS Pact Broker, use broker_username / broker_password- For PactFlow Pact Broker, use broker_tokensuccess, logs = verifier.verify_with_broker(    # broker_username=PACT_BROKER_USERNAME,    # broker_password=PACT_BROKER_PASSWORD,    broker_url=PACT_BROKER_URL,    broker_token=PACT_BROKER_TOKEN,    publish_version=APPLICATION_VERSION,    publish_verification_results=True,    verbose=True,    provider_version_branch=PROVIDER_BRANCH,    enable_pending=True,)assert success == 0```The parameters for this differ slightly in naming from their CLI equivalents:| CLI                               |  native Python                 | |-----------------------------------|------------------------------- || `--log-dir`                       | `log_dir`                      || `--log-level`                     | `log_level`                    || `--provider-app-version`          | `provider_app_version`         || `--headers`                       | `custom_provider_headers`      || `--consumer-version-tag`          | `consumer_tags`                || `--provider-version-tag`          | `provider_tags`                || `--provider-states-setup-url`     | `provider_states_setup_url`    || `--verbose`                       | `verbose`                      || `--consumer-version-selector`     | `consumer_selectors`           | | `--publish-verification-results`  | `publish_verification_results` || `--provider-version-branch`       | `provider_version_branch`      |You can see more details in the examples- [Message Provider Verifier Test](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python/tree/master/examples/message/tests/provider/test_message_provider.py)- [Flask Provider Verifier Test](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python/tree/master/examples/flask_provider/tests/provider/test_provider.py)- [FastAPI Provider Verifier Test](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python/tree/master/examples/fastapi_provider/tests/provider/test_provider.py)### Provider StatesIn many cases, your contracts will need very specific data to exist on the providerto pass successfully. If you are fetching a user profile, that user needs to exist,if querying a list of records, one or more records needs to exist. To supportdecoupling the testing of the consumer and provider, Pact offers the idea of providerstates to communicate from the consumer what data should exist on the provider.When setting up the testing of a provider you will also need to setup the management ofthese provider states. The Pact verifier does this by making additional HTTP requests tothe `--provider-states-setup-url` you provide. This URL could beon the provider application or a separate one. Some strategies for managing state include:- Having endpoints in your application that are not active in production that create and delete your datastore state- A separate application that has access to the same datastore to create and delete, like a separate App Engine module or Docker container pointing to the same datastore- A standalone application that can start and stop the other server with different datastore statesFor more information about provider states, refer to the [Pact documentation] on [Provider States].# Development&lt;!-- Absolute link for rendering page in docs.pact.io --&gt;Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)To setup a development environment:1. If you want to run tests for all Python versions, install 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 from source or using a tool like [pyenv]2. Its recommended to create a Python [virtualenv] for the projectTo setup the environment, run tests, and package the application, run:`make release`If you are just interested in packaging pact-python so you can install it using pip:`make package`This creates a `dist/pact-python-N.N.N.tar.gz` file, where the Ns are the current version.From there you can use pip to install it:`pip install ./dist/pact-python-N.N.N.tar.gz`## Offline Installation of Standalone PackagesAlthough all Ruby standalone applications are predownloaded into the wheel artifact, it may be useful, for development, purposes to install custom Ruby binaries. In which case, use the `bin-path` flag.```pip install pact-python --bin-path=/absolute/path/to/folder/containing/pact/binaries/for/your/os```Pact binaries can be found at [Pact Ruby Releases](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby-standalone/releases).## TestingThis project has unit and end to end tests, which can both be run from make:Unit: `make test`End to end: `make e2e`## ContactJoin us in slack: [![slack](https://slack.pact.io/badge.svg)](https://slack.pact.io)or- Twitter: [@pact_up](https://twitter.com/pact_up)- Stack Overflow: [stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pact](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pact)[bundler]: http://bundler.io/[context manager]: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Context_Managers[Pact]: https://docs.pact.io[Pact Broker]: https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker[Pact documentation]: https://docs.pact.io/[Pact Mock Service]: https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-mock_service[Pact specification]: https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification[Provider States]: https://docs.pact.io/getting_started/provider_states[pact-provider-verifier]: https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-provider-verifier[pyenv]: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv[rvm]: https://rvm.io/[rbenv]: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv[virtualenv]: http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/</longdescription>
