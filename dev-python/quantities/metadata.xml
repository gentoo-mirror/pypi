	<longdescription>==========quantities==========Quantities is designed to handle arithmetic andconversions of physical quantities, which have a magnitude, dimensionalityspecified by various units, and possibly an uncertainty. See the tutorial_for examples. Quantities builds on the popular numpy library and isdesigned to work with numpy ufuncs, many of which are alreadysupported. Quantities is actively developed, and while the current featuresand API are stable, test coverage is incomplete so the package is notsuggested for mission-critical applications.|pypi version|_ |Build status|_.. |pypi version| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/quantities.png.. _`pypi version`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/quantities.. |Build status| image:: https://github.com/python-quantities/python-quantities/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=master.. _`Build status`: https://github.com/python-quantities/python-quantities/actions/workflows/test.yml.. _tutorial: http://python-quantities.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/tutorial.htmlA Python package for handling physical quantities. The source code and issuetracker are hosted on GitHub:https://www.github.com/python-quantities/python-quantitiesDownload--------Get the latest version of quantities fromhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/quantities/To get the Git version do::    $ git clone git://github.com/python-quantities/python-quantities.gitDocumentation and usage-----------------------You can find the official documentation at:http://python-quantities.readthedocs.io/Here is a simple example:.. code:: python   &gt;&gt;&gt; import quantities as pq   &gt;&gt;&gt; distance = 42*pq.metre   &gt;&gt;&gt; time = 17*pq.second   &gt;&gt;&gt; velocity = distance / time   &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;%.3f %s&quot; % (velocity.magnitude, velocity.dimensionality)   '2.471 m/s'   &gt;&gt;&gt; velocity + 3   Traceback (most recent call last):     ...   ValueError: Unable to convert between units of &quot;dimensionless&quot; and &quot;m/s&quot;Installation------------quantities has a hard dependency on the `NumPy &lt;http://www.numpy.org&gt;`_ library.You should install it first, please refer to the NumPy installation guide:http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.htmlTo install quantities itself, then simply run::    $ pip install quantitiesTests-----To execute all tests, install pytest::    $ python -m pip install pytestAnd run::    $ pytestin the current directory. The master branch is automatically tested byGitHub Actions.Author------quantities was originally written by Darren Dale, and has received contributions from `many people`_... _`many people`: https://github.com/python-quantities/python-quantities/graphs/contributorsLicense-------Quantities only uses BSD compatible code.
