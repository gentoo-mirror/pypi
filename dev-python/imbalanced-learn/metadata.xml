Use the followingcommands to get a copy from Github and install all dependencies::  git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn.git  cd imbalanced-learn  pip install .Be aware that you can install in developer mode with::  pip install --no-build-isolation --editable .If you wish to make pull-requests on GitHub, we advise you to installpre-commit::  pip install pre-commit  pre-commit installTesting~~~~~~~After installation, you can use `pytest` to run the test suite::  make coverageDevelopment-----------The development of this scikit-learn-contrib is in line with the oneof the scikit-learn community. Therefore, you can refer to their`Development Guide&lt;http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers&gt;`_.About-----If you use imbalanced-learn in a scientific publication, we would appreciatecitations to the following paper::  @article{JMLR:v18:16-365,  author  = {Guillaume  Lema{{\^i}}tre and Fernando Nogueira and Christos K. Aridas},  title   = {Imbalanced-learn: A Python Toolbox to Tackle the Curse of Imbalanced Datasets in Machine Learning},  journal = {Journal of Machine Learning Research},  year    = {2017},  volume  = {18},  number  = {17},  pages   = {1-5},  url     = {http://jmlr.org/papers/v18/16-365}  }Most classification algorithms will only perform optimally when the number ofsamples of each class is roughly the same. Highly skewed datasets, where theminority is heavily outnumbered by one or more classes, have proven to be achallenge while at the same time becoming more and more common.One way of addressing this issue is by re-sampling the dataset as to offset thisimbalance with the hope of arriving at a more robust and fair decision boundarythan you would otherwise.You can refer to the `imbalanced-learn`_ documentation to find details aboutthe implemented algorithms... _imbalanced-learn: https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html</longdescription>
