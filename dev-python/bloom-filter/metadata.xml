	<longdescription>Note: This project has gone unmaintained for a while,please use the more up-to-date project at: - https://github.com/remram44/python-bloom-filter- https://pypi.org/project/bloom-filter2/A pure python bloom filter (low storage requirement, probabilisticset datastructure) is provided.  It is known to work on CPython 2.x,CPython 3.x, Pypy and Jython.Includes mmap, in-memory and disk-seek backends.The user specifies the desired maximum number of elements and thedesired maximum false positive probability, and the modulecalculates the rest.Usage:::    from bloom_filter import BloomFilter    # instantiate BloomFilter with custom settings,    # max_elements is how many elements you expect the filter to hold.    # error_rate defines accuracy; You can use defaults with    # `BloomFilter()` without any arguments. Following example    # is same as defaults:    bloom = BloomFilter(max_elements=10000, error_rate=0.1)    # Test whether the bloom-filter has seen a key:    assert &quot;test-key&quot; in bloom is False    # Mark the key as seen    bloom.add(&quot;test-key&quot;)    # Now check again    assert &quot;test-key&quot; in bloom is True    </longdescription>
