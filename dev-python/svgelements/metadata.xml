	<longdescription># svgelements`svgelements` does high fidelity SVG parsing and geometric rendering. The goal is to successfully and correctly process SVG for use with any scripts that may need or want to use SVG files as geometric data.This is both facilitated by, and results in, very useful elements within the SVG spec: Path, Matrix, Angle, Length, Color, Point and other SVG and CSS Elements. The SVG spec defines a variety of elements which generally interoperate. In order to have a robust experience with SVGs we must be able to correctly deal with the parsing and interactions of these elements.This project began as part of `meerK40t` which does SVG loading of files for laser cutting. It attempts to more fully map out the SVG specification, objects, and paths, while remaining easy to use and largely backwards compatible. These elements are quite useful in their own right. For example, the zooming and panning within `meerK40t` is done using the SVG matrix which more robust than the wxPython one. Internal console commands within `meerK40t` allows specifying robustly parsed angles of rotation, colors of objects, and naively uses the Path() and SVGImage objects. The ability to have these robustly manipulated with affine transformations provides considerable utility. There is significant utility in the interactions between these objects, however if you just want to robustly parse some SVG and convert the data to your own structures that is entirely reasonable.Without robust SVG parsing you'll find repeated edge cases of some svg files that do not parse correctly. `svgelements` aims to avoid those pitfalls with robust adherence to the SVG spec.# LicenseThis module is under a MIT License.https://github.com/meerk40t/svgelements/blob/master/LICENSE# Installing`pip install svgelements`Then in a script:`from svgelements import *`# RequirementsNone.However, there are some soft dependencies, with some common additions do modify the functionality slightly. If `scipy` is installed then the arc length code quickly provide the exact correct answer. Some of the SVGImage code is able to load the images if given access to PIL/Pillow. And if `numpy` exists there's a special `npoint()` command to do lightning fast linearization for Shapes.# Compatibility`svgelements` is compatible with Python 3+.  Support for 2.7 was dropped at Python 2 End-Of-Life January 1, 2020.We remain nominally backwards compatible with `svg.path`, passing the same robust tests from that project. There may be number of breaking changes. However, since `svgelements` permit a lot of leeway in what is accepted and how it's accepted it will have a huge degree of compatibility with projects seen and unseen. # PhilosophyThe goal of this project is to provide SVG spec-like elements and structures. Conforming to the SVG standard 1.1 and elements of 2.0. These provide much of the implementation decisions, with regard to the implementation of the objects. If there is a question on implementation and the SVG documentation has a methodology, that is the preferred methodology. If the SVG spec says one thing, and `svgelements` does something else, that is a bug.The primary goal of this project is to make a more robust version of `svg.path` to fully parse SVG files. This requires including other elements like `Point`, `Matrix`, and `Color`, etc. with clear emphasis on conforming to the SVG spec in all ways that realworld uses for SVG demands.`svgelements` should conform to the SVG Conforming Interpreter class (2.5.4. Conforming SVG Interpreters):&gt;An SVG interpreter is a program which can parse and process SVG document fragments. Examples of SVG interpreters are server-side transcoding tools or optimizer (e.g., a tool which converts SVG content into modified SVG content) or analysis tools (e.g., a tool which extracts the text content from SVG content, or a validity checker).Real world functionality demands we must correctly and reasonably provide reading, transcoding, and manipulation of SVG content.The svgelements code should not include any hard dependencies. It should remain a single file with emphasis on allowing projects to merely include a copy of `svgelements.py` to do any SVG parsing required. # Features SupportedSVG is a huge spec and bleeds into a lot of areas. Many of these are supported some are not.## Supported* Robust SVG parsing.* Basic SVG writing* SVG/CSS Lengths: `px`, `pt`, `pc`, `cm`, `mm`, `in`, `%`* SVG/CSS Color: keyword, `#rrggbb`, `#rgb`, `rgb(r,g,b)`, `rgb(r%,g%,b%)`, `rgba(r,g,b,a)`, `hsl(hue, s, l)`* SVG/CSS Matrix     * Full matrix support. All objects have a `.transform` object with all cascading matrix operations. Including viewport.* SVG Viewport. - Correctly processes viewports, including `preserveAspectRatio`.* CSS Angle - `deg`, `rad`, `grad`, `turn`. Full use of these within `rotate(&lt;angle&gt;)` transformation command.* SVG Shape: Rect - full parsing of `x`, `y`, `rx`, `ry`, `width`, `height`, presentation attributes in length/percent form.* SVG Shape: Circle - full parsing of `cx`, `cy`, `r`, presentation attributes in length/percent form.* SVG Shape: Ellipse - full parsing of `cx`, `cy`, `rx`, `ry`, presentation attributes in length/percent form.* SVG Shape: Polygon - full parsing of `.points`* SVG Shape: Polyline - full parsing of `.points`* SVG Shape: Line - full parsing of `x0`, `y0`, `x1`, `y1` presentation attributes in length/percent form.     * (Internally this is called `SimpleLine` since `Line` is a `PathSegment` type.)* SVG Shape: Path - Perfect path_d parsing. Relative/Absolute, Smooth BezierCurve, preservation of original segment form.* PathSegments with advanced geometric functions. eg. `point()`, `npoint()`, `bbox()` `reverse()`* Transformation of Shapes and Paths, within groups as well as with respect to the SVG Viewport.* First order use of `.stroke`, `.fill` and `.stroke_width` for all Shapes. `Stroke` and `Fill` are colors (Fill may return a `Pattern`, or Gradient-type in future versions, but is currently *always* a Color), and `stroke_width` is a length/percent value (will be rendered to a float during parsing).* SVG Spec deconstruction of basic shapes into Paths within regard to the SVG 2.0 spec. Path(shape) or shape.d()* `Group` objects. Container class.* `clipPath` objects, these are assigned as a `.clip_path` to any object that referenced them.* `&lt;defs&gt;` and `&lt;use&gt;` functionality within the parsing tree.* Accurate referencing of objects in the ShadowDOM.* `Pattern` objects. These are parsed they are not currently assigned.* `Text` objects. The lack of a font engine makes this class more of a parsed stub class.* `Image` creates `SVGImage` objects which will load Images if `Pillow` is installed with a call to `.load()`. Correct parsing of `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` and `viewbox`. * `Desc` description object.* `Title` description object.* Nested `SVG` objects. (Caveats see Non-Supported).* CSS Styling.## Not supportedSome things are currently not supported. * Full CSS/DOM specific parsing and modifications.* Full CSS StyleSheet.

(the height of 'm' and 'x' is unknown).* Slicing of SVG geometry, outside of viewbox.* Slicing of SVG geometry, within clipPath* External Loading of SVG files.* External loading of SVGz files.* External loading of CSS data from another file.* SVG Animation* Styling based on Descendant, Child, FirstChild, Sibling, Attribute, AttributeWithValue.* `Glyph` - Dropped in SVG 2.0* `tref` - Dropped in SVG 2.0# ParsingThe primary function of `svgelements` is to parse svg files. There are two main functions to facilitate this```python    def parse(source,              reify=True,              ppi=DEFAULT_PPI,              width=1,              height=1,              color=&quot;black&quot;,              transform=None,              context=None):```This parse function takes in values that cannot be known to the SVG but which are essential to the the rendering of the shapes. Parsing will pre-apply things like the relative translation by the viewport. It will solve the structural changes for the with the `&lt;use&gt;` and `&lt;defs&gt;`, and any items that are known SVG elements will be turned into their requisite values and parsed accordingly. So the `.fill` and `.stroke` of a `Path` will be filled in with a type of `Color` and the `.transform` of the Shape will be a type of `Matrix`. The `.values` for all the `SVGElement` will have the relevant inherited values. This permits parsing to deal with even unknown types of objects within the SVG by falling back to something akin to DOM parsing of the file. In cases of `&lt;use&gt;` and `&lt;defs&gt;` these unknown elements can still reference other. Since this structural shadow tree will be solved during the parse.`parse()` is a static function which takes a `source` file or stream of svg data to be parsed. This will return an `SVG` object which is a type of `Group`. There are several values which can be configured with other values as needed. `reify` determines whether the parsed elements in the `SVG` should have their transform matrix applied or not. This includes the effective matrix resulting from viewport.The `ppi` value defaults to `96` as this is quite common some other graphics programs use `72` and other values are permitted. Since there's nothing directly in the SVG spec setting this value and other places can vary with their value here. We can't predetermine this value. However it regulates all the relationships between physical values like a 1in by 1in `rect` to the unitless pixel values of the SVG. The `width` and `height` values are unknown to the SVG parsing. This is the physical view size of the svg itself. This often will have little impact in the SVG rendering however sometimes things widths are set to `100%` or heights to `50%` and those are according to the spec relative to the actual view we're using. The svg has no direct access to this. If we have a `ppi` value these height and width can be set to absolute units like `6in` or any other acceptable `Length` value that can be solved with `ppi`.The `color` is the value of the `currentColor` within the SVG spec. Usually the default stroke and fill values are set but in some cases these are set to `currentColor` which is a property of the CSS outside the scope of the SVG. In this case that color needs to be provided. It will be a rare edge case.The `transform` value is typical CSS/SVG transform matrix code to be preappended to the matrix before even the viewbox. If you need to set some units or apply something to the entire svg without changing things within the CSS this value becomes important. Especially when dealing with edge cases like the difference of `transform` applied directly to the `SVG` tag itself.The `context` permits giving a context of already set values that are come from outside the current svg context, such as we would find if we had SVG files embedded into SVG files. The second function within parsing that matters is the `.elements()` this is a function that exists on any `SVG` object and will flatten the elements yielding them in order.Here's an example parser with elements(). ```python       for element in svg.elements():            try:                if element.values['visibility'] == 'hidden':                    continue            except (KeyError, AttributeError):                pass            if isinstance(element, SVGText):                elements.append(element)            elif isinstance(element, Path):                if len(element) != 0:                    elements.append(element)            elif isinstance(element, Shape):                e = Path(element)                e.reify()  # In some cases the shape could not have reified, the path must.                if len(e) != 0:                    elements.append(e)            elif isinstance(element, SVGImage):                try:                    element.load(os.path.dirname(pathname))                    if element.image is not None:                        elements.append(element)                except OSError:                    pass   ```Here a few things are checked. The element.values for ['visibility'] is checked if it's hidden it is not added to our flat object list. Texts are specific added. Paths are only added if they have `PathSegments` and are not completely blank. Any Shape object is converted to a Path() object and reified. Any SVGImage objects are loaded. This is a soft dependency on PIL/Pillow to load images stored within SVG. The SVG `.elements()` function can also take a conditional function that well be used to test each element before yielding it. In most cases we don't want every single type of thing an svg can produce. We might just want all the Path objects so we check for any Path and include that but also for any non-Path Shape and convert that to a path. `pathname` is an attempt to get the local directory for loading relative path images.# WritingCirca 1.9.0+ some basic SVG writing was added. Any `SVGElement` object will permit you to call `write_xml(filename)` the expectation is that you save svg files. If you specify an `svgz` file it will gzip the save stream providing you with a `svgz` file. If you want the xml for a different purpose you may also call `string_xml` which provides the object as a string.```python&gt;&gt;&gt; Group(id=&quot;group&quot;).string_xml()'&lt;g id=&quot;group&quot; /&gt;'```This is not intended to be perfect, the project itself is potentially lossy and CSS tables and style tags will be gone, `Use` objects will be replaced with their real objects and these modifications are not able to be restored. The primary purpose of this project is to read correct geometric data.```python&gt;&gt;&gt; SVG().write_xml(&quot;empty.svg&quot;)```Writes a file called `empty.svg`.```xml&lt;svg version=&quot;1.1&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot; xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;```Or getting slightly more complex:```pythons = SVG()s.append(Rect(0,0,&quot;2in&quot;, &quot;2in&quot;))s.write_xml(&quot;rect.svg&quot;)```Produces a file called `rect.svg`.```xml&lt;svg version=&quot;1.1&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot; xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;rect width=&quot;2in&quot; height=&quot;2in&quot; /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;```Writing should work, but this is not the initial purpose of the library. Some non-parsed elements will restore to the file correctly, others may be lost. However, errors in this should still be reported. The reading is quite well vetted and robust, the writing may have issues needing to be corrected.# OverviewThe versatility of the project is provided through expansive and highly intuitive dunder methods, and robust parsing of object parameters. Points, PathSegments, Paths, Shapes, Subpaths can be multiplied by a matrix. We can add Shapes, Paths, PathSegments, and Subpaths together. And many non-declared but functionally understandable elements are automatically parsed. Such as adding strings of path_d characters to a Path or multiplying an element by the SVG Transform string elements.While many objects perform a lot of interoperations, a lot many svg elements are designed to also work independently, and be independently useful.## PointPoints define a single location in 2D space. The Point class is intended to take a wide variety of different initial definitions to wrap them into being a point.* Point(x,y)* (x,y)* [x,y]* &quot;x, y&quot;* x + yj (complex number)* a class with .x and .y as methods.Most objects requiring a point will wrap that object with the included Point class meaning any of these initial arguments is acceptable. Including independent x and y parameters, a tuple of x and y, a list of x and y, a string that parses akin to points within `polyline` objects, complex numbers with a real x and imag y values. And any class with `.x` or `.y` attributes.---    &gt;&gt;&gt; Point(10,10) * &quot;rotate(90)&quot;    Point(-10,10)## MatrixMatrices define affine transformations of 2d space and objects.* Matrix.scale(s)* Matrix.scale(sx,sy)* Matrix.scale(sx,sy,px,py)* Matrix.rotate(angle)* Matrix.rotate(angle, px, py* Matrix.skew_x(angle)* Matrix.skew_x(angle, px, py)* Matrix.skew_y(angle)* Matrix.skew_y(angle, px, py)* Matrix.translate(tx)* Matrix.translate(tx, ty)* Transform string values.    * &quot;scale(s)&quot;    * &quot;scale(sx,sy)&quot;    * &quot;translate(20,20) scale(2)&quot;    * &quot;rotate(0.25 turns)&quot;    * Any valid SVG or CSS transform string will be accepted as a matrix.    ---    &gt;&gt;&gt; Matrix(&quot;rotate(100grad)&quot;)    Matrix(0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0)    The matrix class also supports Length translates for x, and y. In some instances, CSS transforms permit length transforms so &quot;translate(20cm, 200mm)&quot; are valid transformations. However, these will cause issues for objects which require non-native units so it is expected that `.render()` will be called on these before they are used in some manner.## PathPaths define sequences of PathSegments that can map out any path element in SVG.* Path() object* String path_d value.---    &gt;&gt;&gt; Path() + &quot;M0,0z&quot;    Path(Move(end=Point(0,0)), Close(start=Point(0,0), end=Point(0,0)))## AngleAngles define various changes in direction.* Angle.degrees(degree_angle)* Angle.radians(radians_angle)* Angle.turns(turns)* Angle.gradians(gradian_angles)* CSS angle string.    * &quot;20deg&quot;    * &quot;0.3turns&quot;    * &quot;1rad&quot;    * &quot;100grad&quot;    ---    &gt;&gt;&gt; Point(0,100) * &quot;rotate(1turn)&quot;    Point(0,100)    &gt;&gt;&gt; Point(0,100) * &quot;rotate(0.5turn)&quot;    Point(-0,-100)    ## ColorColors define object color.* XHTML color names: &quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;dark grey&quot;, etc.* 3 digit hex: &quot;#F00&quot;* 4 digit hex: &quot;#FF00&quot;* 6 digit hex: &quot;#FF0000&quot;* 8 digit hex: &quot;#FFFF0000&quot;* &quot;RGB(r,g,b)&quot;* &quot;RGB(r%, g%, b%)&quot;---    &gt;&gt;&gt; Circle(stroke=&quot;yellow&quot;)    Circle(center=Point(0,0), r=1, stroke=&quot;#ffff00&quot;)## LengthLengths define the amount of linear space between two things.* &quot;20cm&quot;* &quot;200mm&quot;* &quot;3in&quot;* Length('200mm')    # ExamplesParse an SVG file:    &gt;&gt;&gt;

These are svg-based objects which interact in coherent ways.## PathThe Path element is based on regebro's code and methods from the `svg.path` project. The primary methodology is to use different PathSegment classes for each segment within a pathd code. These should always have a high degree of backwards compatibility. And for most purposes importing the relevant classes from `svgelements` should be highly compatible with any existing code.For this reason `svgelements` tests include `svg.path` tests in this project. And while the Point class accepts and works like a `complex` it is not actually a complex. This permits code from other projects to quickly port without requiring an extensive rewrite. But, the custom class allows for improvements like making the `Matrix` object easy.* ``Path(*segments)``Just as with `svg.path` the ``Path`` class is a mutable sequence, and it behaves like a list.You can add to it and replace path segments etc:    &gt;&gt;&gt; path = Path(Line(100+100j,300+100j), Line(100+100j,300+100j))    &gt;&gt;&gt; path.append(QuadraticBezier(300+100j, 200+200j, 200+300j))    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(path)    L 300,100 L 300,100 Q 200,200 200,300        &gt;&gt;&gt; path[1] = Line(200+100j,300+100j)    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(path)    L 300,100 L 300,100 Q 200,200 200,300        &gt;&gt;&gt; del path[1]    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(path)    L 300,100 Q 200,200 200,300        &gt;&gt;&gt; path = Move() + path    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(path)    M 100,100 L 300,100 Q 200,200 200,300The path object also has a ``d()`` method that will return theSVG representation of the Path segments:    &gt;&gt;&gt; path.d()    'M 100,100 L 300,100 Q 200,200 200,300'The d() parameter also takes a value for relative:    &gt;&gt;&gt; path.d(relative=True)    'm 100,100 l 200,0 q -100,100 -100,200'More modern and preferred methods are to simply use path_d strings where needed.     &gt;&gt;&gt; print(Path(&quot;M0,0v1h1v-1z&quot;))    M 0,0 L 0,1 L 1,1 L 1,0 ZAnd to use scaling factors as needed.    &gt;&gt;&gt; (Path(&quot;M0,0v1h1v-1z&quot;) * &quot;scale(20)&quot;).bbox()    (0.0, 0.0, 20.0, 20.0)---A ``Path`` object that is a collection of the PathSegment objects. These can be defined by combining a PathSegment with another PathSegment initializing it with `Path()` or `Path(*segments)` or `Path(&lt;svg_text&gt;)`.### SubpathsSubpaths provide a window into a Path object. These are backed by the Path they are created from and consequently operations performed on them apply to that part of the path.    &gt;&gt;&gt; p = Path('M 0,0 Q 50,50 100,0 M 20,20 v 20 h 20 v-20 h-20 z')    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(p)    M 0,0 Q 50,50 100,0 M 20,20 L 20,40 L 40,40 L 40,20 L 20,20 Z    &gt;&gt;&gt; q = p.subpath(1)     &gt;&gt;&gt; q *= &quot;scale(2)&quot;    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(p)    M 0,0 Q 50,50 100,0 M 40,40 L 40,80 L 80,80 L 80,40 L 40,40 Zor likewise `.reverse()` (notice the path will go 80,40 first rather than 40,80.)    &gt;&gt;&gt; q.reverse()    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(p)    M 0,0 Q 50,50 100,0 M 40,40 L 80,40 L 80,80 L 40,80 L 40,40 Z### SegmentsThere are 6 PathSegment objects:``Line``, ``Arc``, ``CubicBezier``, ``QuadraticBezier``, ``Move`` and ``Close``. These have a 1:1 correspondence to the commands in a `pathd`.    &gt;&gt;&gt; from svgelements import Path, Line, Arc, CubicBezier, QuadraticBezier, CloseAll of these objects have a ``.point()`` function which will return thecoordinates of a point on the path, where the point is given as a floatingpoint value where ``0.0`` is the start of the path and ``1.0`` is end.You can calculate the length of a Path or its segments with the ``.length()`` function. For CubicBezier and Arc segments this is done by geometric approximation and for this reason **may be very slow**. You can make it faster by passing in an ``error`` option to the method. If you don't pass in error, it defaults to ``1e-12``. While the project has no dependencies, if you have `scipy` installed the Arc.length() function will use to the hypergeometric exact formula contained and will quickly return with the exact answer.    &gt;&gt;&gt; CubicBezier(300+100j, 100+100j, 200+200j, 200+300j).length(error=1e-5)    297.2208145656899CubicBezier and Arc also has a ``min_depth`` option that specifies theminimum recursion depth. This is set to 5 by default, resulting in using aminimum of 32 segments for the calculation. Setting it to 0 is a bad idea forCubicBeziers, as they may become approximated to a straight line.``Line.length()`` and ``QuadraticBezier.length()`` also takes theseparameters, but they unneeded as direct values rather than approximations are returned.CubicBezier and QuadraticBezier also have ``is_smooth_from(previous)``methods, that checks if the segment is a &quot;smooth&quot; segment compared to thegiven segment.Unlike `svg.path` the preferred method of getting a Path from a `pathd` string isas an argument:    &gt;&gt;&gt; from svgelements import Path    &gt;&gt;&gt; Path('M 100 100 L 300 100')    Path(Move(end=Point(100,100)), Line(start=Point(100,100), end=Point(300,100)))#### PathSegment ClassesThese are the SVG PathSegment classes. See the `SVG specifications&lt;http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html&gt;`_ for more information on what eachparameter means.* ``Move(start, end)`` The move object describes a move to the start of the next subpath. It may lack a start position but not an end position.* ``Close(start, end)`` The close object describes a close path element. It will have a length if and only if the end point is not equal to the subpath start point. Neither the start point or end point is required.* ``Line(start, end)`` The line object describes a line moving straight from one point to the next point. * ``Arc(start, radius, rotation, arc, sweep, end)`` The arc object describes an arc across a circular path. This supports multiple types of parameterizations. The given default there is compatible with `svg.path` and has a complex radius. It is also valid to divide radius into `rx` and `ry` or Arc(start, end, center, prx, pry, sweep) where start, end, center, prx, pry are points and sweep is the radians value of the arc distance traveled.* ``QuadraticBezier(start, control, end)`` the quadratic bezier object describes a single control point bezier curve.* ``CubicBezier(start, control1, control2, end)`` the cubic bezier curve object describes a two control point bezier curve.### ExamplesThis SVG path example draws a triangle:    &gt;&gt;&gt; path1 = Path('M 100 100 L 300 100 L 200 300 z')You can format SVG paths in many different ways, all valid paths should beaccepted:    &gt;&gt;&gt; path2 = Path('M100,100L300,100L200,300z')And these paths should be equal:    &gt;&gt;&gt; path1 == path2    TrueYou can also build a path from objects:    &gt;&gt;&gt; path3 = Path(Move(100 + 100j), Line(100 + 100j, 300 + 100j), Line(300 + 100j, 200 + 300j), Close(200 + 300j, 100 + 100j))And it should again be equal to the first path::    &gt;&gt;&gt; path1 == path3    TruePaths are mutable sequences, you can slice and append::    &gt;&gt;&gt; path1.append(QuadraticBezier(300+100j, 200+200j, 200+300j))    &gt;&gt;&gt; len(path1[2:]) == 3    TrueNote that there is no protection against you creating paths that are invalid.You can for example have a Close command that doesn't end at the path start:    &gt;&gt;&gt; wrong = Path(Line(100+100j,200+100j), Close(200+300j, 0))    &gt;&gt;&gt; wrong.d()    'L 200,100 Z'## Matrix (Transformations)SVG 1.1, 7.15.3 defines the matrix form as:    [a c  e]    [b d  f]Since we are delegating to SVG spec for such things, this is how it is implemented in elements.To be compatible with SVG 1.1 and SVG 2.0 the matrix class provided has all the SVG functions as well as the CSS functions:* translate(x,[y])* translateX(x)* translateY(y)* scale(x,[y])* scaleX(x)* scaleY(y)* skew(x,[y])* skewX(x)* skewY(y)Since we have compatibility with CSS for the SVG 2.0 spec compatibility we can perform length translations:    &gt;&gt;&gt; Point(0,0) * Matrix(&quot;Translate(1cm,1cm)&quot;)    Point('1cm','1cm')Do note, however that this isn't an intended purpose. Points are expected in native units. You should render the Matrix prior to using it. This means you must give it the correct units to translate the information from one form to another.     &gt;&gt;&gt; Point(0,0) * (Matrix(&quot;Translate(1cm,1cm)&quot;).render(ppi=96.0))    Point(37.795296,37.795296)We can also rotate by `turns`, `grad`, `deg`, `rad` which are permitted CSS angles:        &gt;&gt;&gt; Point(10,0) * Matrix(&quot;Rotate(1turn)&quot;)    Point(10,-0)    &gt;&gt;&gt; Point(10,0) * Matrix(&quot;Rotate(400grad)&quot;)    Point(10,-0)    &gt;&gt;&gt; Point(10,0) * Matrix(&quot;Rotate(360deg)&quot;)    Point(10,-0)    A goal of this project is to provide a robust modifications of Path objects including matrix transformations. This is done by three major shifts from `svg.path`s methods. * Points are not stored as complex numbers. These are stored as Point objects, which have backwards compatibility with complex numbers, without the data actually being backed by a `complex`.* A matrix is added which conforms to the SVGMatrix element. The matrix contains valid versions of all the affine transformations elements required by the SVG Spec.* The `Arc` object is fundamentally backed by a different point-based parameterization.The objects themselves have robust dunder methods. So if you have a path object you may simply multiply it by a matrix.    &gt;&gt;&gt; Path(Line(0+0j, 100+100j)) * Matrix.scale(2)    Path(Line(start=Point(0,0), end=Point(100,100)), transform=Matrix(2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0), stroke='None', fill='None')Or rotate a parsed path.    &gt;&gt;&gt; Path(&quot;M0,0L100,100&quot;) * Matrix.rotate(30)    Path(Move(end=Point(0,0)), Line(start=Point(0,0), end=Point(100,100)), transform=Matrix(0.154251449888, -0.988031624093, 0.988031624093, 0.154251449888, 0, 0))Or modify an SVG path.    &gt;&gt;&gt; str(Path(&quot;M0,0L100,100&quot;) * Matrix.rotate(30))    'M 0,0 L 114.228,-83.378'    The Matrix objects can be used to modify points:    &gt;&gt;&gt; Point(100,100) * Matrix(&quot;scale(2)&quot;)    Point(200,200)        &gt;&gt;&gt; Point(100,100) * (Matrix(&quot;scale(2)&quot;) * Matrix(&quot;Translate(40,40)&quot;))    Point(240,240)    Do note that the order of operations for matrices matters:    &gt;&gt;&gt; Point(100,100) * (Matrix(&quot;Translate(40,40)&quot;) * Matrix(&quot;scale(2)&quot;))    Point(280,280)    The first version is:     &gt;&gt;&gt; (Matrix(&quot;scale(2)&quot;) * Matrix(&quot;Translate(40,40)&quot;))    Matrix(2, 0, 0, 2, 40, 40)The second is:    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Matrix(&quot;Translate(40,40)&quot;) * Matrix(&quot;scale(2)&quot;))    Matrix(2, 0, 0, 2, 80, 80)    This is:    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Point(100,100) * Matrix(&quot;Matrix(2,0,0,2,80,80)&quot;)    Point(280,280)### SVG Dictionary Parsing    &gt;&gt;&gt; node = { 'd': &quot;M0,0 100,0, 0,100 z&quot;, 'transform': &quot;scale(0.5)&quot;}    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(Path(node['d']) * Matrix(node['transform']))    M 0,0 L 50,0 L 0,50 Z### SVG Viewport Scaling, Unit ScalingThere is need in many applications to append a transformation for the viewbox, height, width. So as to prevent a variety of errors where the expected size is vastly different from the actual size. If we have a viewbox of &quot;0 0 100 100&quot; but the height and width show that to be 50cm wide, then a path &quot;M25,50L75,50&quot; within that viewbox has a real size of length of 25cm which can be quite different from 50 (unitless value).This conversion is done through the `Viewbox` object. This operation is automatically done for during SVG parsing.Viewbox objects have a call to `.transform()` which will provide the string for an equivalent transformation for the given viewbox.The `Viewbox.transform()` code conforms to the algorithm given in SVG 1.1 7.2, SVG 2.0 8.2 'equivalent transform of an SVG viewport.' This will also fully implement the `preserveAspectRatio`, `xMidYMid`, and `meetOrSlice` values for the viewboxes.## SVG ShapesAnother important SVG elements are the shapes. While all of these can be converted to paths. They can serve some usages in their original form. There are methods to deform a rectangle that simple don't exist in the path form of that object.* Rect* Ellipse* Circle* Line (SimpleLine)* Polyline* PolygonThe Line shape is converted into a shape called SimpleLine to not interfere with the Line(PathSegment).A Shape is said to be equal to another Shape or a Path if they decompose to same Path.    &gt;&gt;&gt; Circle() == Ellipse()    True     &gt;&gt;&gt; Rect() == Path('m0,0h1v1h-1z')    True### RectRectangles are defined by x, y and height, width. Within SVG there are also rounded corners defined with `rx` and `ry`.     &gt;&gt;&gt; Rect(10,10,8,4).d()    'M 10,10 L 18,10 L 18,14 L 10,14 Z'Much like all the paths these shapes also contain a `.d()` function that produces the path data for them. This could then be wrapped into a Path().    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(Path(Rect(10,10,8,4).d()) * &quot;rotate(0.5turns)&quot;)    M -10,-10 L -18,-10 L -18,-14 L -10,-14 Z    Or simply passed to the Path:    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(Path(Rect(10,10,8,4)) * &quot;rotate(0.5turns)&quot;)    M -10,-10 L -18,-10 L -18,-14 L -10,-14 L -10,-10 ZOr simply multiplied by the matrix itself:    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(Rect(10,10,8,4) * &quot;rotate(0.5turns)&quot;)    Rect(x=10, y=10, width=8, height=4, transform=Matrix(-1, 0, -0, -1, 0, 0), stroke='None', fill='None')And you can equally decompose that Shape:    &gt;&gt;&gt; (Rect(10,10,8,4) * &quot;rotate(0.5turns)&quot;).d()    'M -10,-10 L -18,-10 L -18,-14 L -10,-14 L -10,-10 Z'Matrices can be applied to Rect objects directly.    &gt;&gt;&gt; from svgelements import *    &gt;&gt;&gt; Rect(10,10,8,4) * &quot;rotate(0.5turns)&quot;    Rect(x=10, y=10, width=8, height=4, transform=Matrix(-1, 0, -0, -1, 0, 0), stroke='None', fill='None')        &gt;&gt;&gt; Rect(10,10,8,4) * &quot;rotate(0.25turns)&quot;    Rect(x=10, y=10, width=8, height=4, transform=Matrix(0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0))Rotated Rects produce path_d strings.:    &gt;&gt;&gt; Rect(10,10,8,4) * &quot;rotate(14deg)&quot;    Rect(x=10, y=10, width=8, height=4, transform=Matrix(0.970295726276, 0.2419218956, -0.2419218956, 0.970295726276, 0, 0))    &gt;&gt;&gt; (Rect(10,10,8,4) * &quot;rotate(14deg)&quot;).d()    'M 7.28373830676,12.1221762188 L 15.046104117,14.0575513836 L 14.0784165346,17.9387342887 L 6.31605072436,16.0033591239 Z'     This also works with `rx` and `ry`: (Note: the path will now contain Arcs)     &gt;&gt;&gt; (Rect(10,10,8,4, 2, 1) * &quot;rotate(0.25turns)&quot;).d()    'M -10,12 L -10,16 A 2,1 90 0,1 -11,18 L -13,18 A 2,1 90 0,1 -14,16 L -14,12 A 2,1 90 0,1 -13,10 L -11,10 A 2,1 90 0,1 -10,12 Z'You can also decompose the shapes in relative modes:    &gt;&gt;&gt; (Rect(10,10,8,4, 2, 1) * &quot;rotate(0.25turns)&quot;).d(relative=True)    'm -10,12 l 1.77636E-15,4 a 2,1 90 0,1 -1,2 l -2,0 a 2,1 90 0,1 -1,-2 l -1.77636E-15,-4 a 2,1 90 0,1 1,-2 l 2,0 a 2,1 90 0,1 1,2 z'### Ellipse &amp; CircleEllipses and Circles are different shapes but since a circle is a particular kind of Ellipse much of the functionality here is duplicated.While the objects are different they can be checked for equivalency:    &gt;&gt;&gt; Ellipse(center=(0,0), rx=10, ry=10) == Circle(center=&quot;0,0&quot;, r=10.0)    True### SimpleLineSimpleLine is renamed from the SVG form of `Line` since we already have `Line` objects as `PathSegment`.     &gt;&gt;&gt; s = SimpleLine(0,0,200,200)    &gt;&gt;&gt; s    SimpleLine(x1=0.0, y1=0.0, x2=200.0, y2=200.0)    &gt;&gt;&gt; s *= &quot;rotate(45)&quot;    &gt;&gt;&gt; s    SimpleLine(x1=0.0, y1=0.0, x2=200.0, y2=200.0, transform=Matrix(0.707106781187, 0.707106781187, -0.707106781187, 0.707106781187, 0, 0))    &gt;&gt;&gt; abs(s)    SimpleLine(x1=0.0, y1=0.0, x2=2.842170943040401e-14, y2=282.842712474619, stroke='None', fill='None')    &gt;&gt;&gt; s.d()    'M 0,0 L 2.84217094304E-14,282.842712475### Polyline and PolygonThe difference here is polylines are not closed while Polygons are closed.    &gt;&gt;&gt; p = Polygon(0,0, 100,0, 100,100, 0,100)    &gt;&gt;&gt; p *= &quot;scale(2)&quot;    &gt;&gt;&gt; p.d()    'M 0,0, L 200,0, L 200,200, L 0,200 Z'and the same for Polyline:    &gt;&gt;&gt; p = Polyline(0,0, 100,0, 100,100, 0,100)    &gt;&gt;&gt; p *= &quot;scale(2)&quot;    &gt;&gt;&gt; p.d()    'M 0,0, L 200,0, L 200,200, L 0,200'    You can just append a &quot;z&quot; to the polyline path though.     &gt;&gt;&gt; Path(Polyline((20,0), (10,10), 0)) + &quot;z&quot; == Polygon(&quot;20,0 10,10 0,0&quot;)    True## CSS LengthThe conversion of lengths to utilizes another element `Length` It provides conversions for `mm`, `cm`, `in`, `px`, `pt`, `pc`, `%`. You can also parse an element like the string '25mm' calling Length('25mm').value(ppi=96) and get the expected results. You can also call `Length('25mm').in_inches()` which will return  25mm in inches. This can be independently useful when dealing with lengths, etc.    &gt;&gt;&gt; Length('25mm').in_inches()    0.9842525## ColorColor is another fundamental element within SVG that is also useful elsewhere. The object contains an 'int' as 'value' in RGBA order, storing alpha in the 8 least signficant bits. It parses all the SVG color functions.If we get the `.fill` or `.stroke` of an object. This can be expressed in many ways, and needs to be converted to a consistent form. We could have a 3, 4, 6, or 8 digit hex. rgb(r,g,b) value, a static dictionary name or percent rgb(r,g,b). And must be properly parsed according to the spec.    &gt;&gt;&gt; Color(&quot;red&quot;).hex    '#ff0000'        &gt;&gt;&gt; Color('red').red    255        &gt;&gt;&gt;Color('hsl(120, 100%, 50%)')    Color('#00ff00')        &gt;&gt;&gt; c = Color('hsl(120, 100%, 50%)')    &gt;&gt;&gt; c.blue = 50    &gt;&gt;&gt; c    Color('#00ff32')    In addition you can set various properties of a particular color.

With regard to `svg.path` it is not back by, but implements all the same functionality as a `complex` and will take a complex as an input. This is so that older `svg.path` code will remain valid. While also allowing for additional functionality like finding a distance.    &gt;&gt;&gt; Point(0+100j).distance_to([0,0])    100.0The class supports `complex` subscribable elements, `.x` and `.y` methods, and `.imag` and `.real`. As well as providing several of these indexing methods.It includes a number of point functions like:* `move_towards(point,float)`: Move this point towards the other point. with an amount [0,1]* `distance_to(point)`: Calculate the Euclidean distance to the other point.* `angle_to(point)`: Calculate the angle to the given point.* `polar_to(angle,distance)`:  Return a point via polar coords at the angle and distance.* `reflected_across(point)`: Returns a point reflected across another point. (Smooth bezier curves use this).This for example takes the 0,0 point turns 1/8th of a turn, and moves forward by 5cm.    &gt;&gt;&gt; Point(0).polar_to(Angle.turns(0.125), Length(&quot;5cm&quot;).value(ppi=96))    Point(133.626550492764,133.626550492764)# AcknowledgmentsThe Path element of this project is based in part on the `regebro/svg.path` ( https://github.com/regebro/svg.path ) project. It is also may be based, in part, on some elements of `mathandy/svgpathtools` ( https://github.com/mathandy/svgpathtools ).</longdescription>
