	<longdescription># AnyAsciiUnicode to ASCII transliteration[**Web Demo**](https://anyascii.com)Converts Unicode characters to their best ASCII representationAnyAscii provides ASCII-only replacement strings for practically all Unicode characters. Text is converted character-by-character without considering the context. The mappings for each script are based on popular existing romanization systems. Symbolic characters are converted based on their meaning or appearance. All ASCII characters in the input are left unchanged, every other character is replaced with printable ASCII characters. Unknown characters and some known characters are replaced with an empty string and removed.```pythonfrom anyascii import anyasciis = anyascii('άνθρωποι')assert s == 'anthropoi'```Python 3.3+ compatible`pip install anyascii`[**FULL README**](https://github.com/anyascii/anyascii)</longdescription>
