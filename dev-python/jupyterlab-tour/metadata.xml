So you can start tour on event only if the user have not seen it; e.g. the welcome tour is launched at JupyterLab start except if the user have seen it.&gt; The state is cleaned if this extension is updated- Tooltip are styled using JupyterLab theming system- Commands to _add_ and _launch_ tours- Through the tour manager (`ITourManager` extension token), add, modify or delete a tour- Connect to tour events through signals- Override the default style (and options) for the tour separatelyThis extension is inspired by [@cdat/jupyterlab-tutorial](https://github.com/CDAT/jupyterlab-tutorial) licensed under BSD 3-Clause License with Copyright (c) 2020, Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC.## Requirements- JupyterLab &gt;= 3.0For JupyterLab 2.x, have look [there](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab-tour/tree/2.x).&gt; For developers, the API has changed between v3 (for JupyterLab 3) and v2 (for JupyterLab 2).## How to add a tour with Advanced SettingsAs a user of JupyterLab, after you've installed `jupyterlab-tour`, you can createyour own _Tours_ as data.- Open the JupyterLab _Advanced Settings_ panel &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl+,&lt;/kbd&gt;- Select _Tours_ from list of settings groups- In the editor, create JSON(5) compatible with the  [react-joyride data model](https://docs.react-joyride.com/props)- The _Tour_ will be available from the _Help Menu_, as well as the _Command Palette_### A simple TourFor example, to show a glowing button on the Jupyter logo, which reveals an orangeoverlay when pressed:```json5// json5 can have comments{  &quot;tours&quot;: [    {      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;my-tour&quot;,      &quot;label&quot;: &quot;My First Tour&quot;,      // steps are required, and have many, many options      &quot;steps&quot;: [        {&quot;target&quot;: &quot;#jp-MainLogo&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Look at this!&quot;}      ],      // below here not required!      &quot;options&quot;: {        &quot;styles&quot;: {          &quot;options&quot;: {            // you can use jupyterlab theme variables            &quot;backgroundColor&quot;: &quot;var(--jp-warn-color0)&quot;          }        }      }    }  ]}```### Shipping a Tour to BinderOn Binder, and elsewhere, you can store the above (_without_ comments) inan [overrides.json] file and put it in the _right place_,e.g. `{sys.prefix}/share/jupyter/lab/settings/overrides.json`. When JupyterLab isnext opened, those overrides will become the defaults, and your tour will be available.An example `overrides.json` might look like:```json5{  &quot;jupyterlab-tour:user-tours&quot;: {    &quot;tours&quot;: [      // that tour up there!    ]  }}```[overrides.json]: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/directories.html#overrides-json## How to add tour for my JupyterLab extensionAs an extension developer, there are two methods to add a tour: the easiest is to use JupyterLab commands and the advanced version is to request thisextension token `ITourManager`.### Add easily a tour```tsconst { commands } = app;// Add a tour - returns the tour or null if something went wrongconst tour = (await app.commands.execute('jupyterlab-tour:add', {  tour: { // Tour must be of type ITour - see src/tokens.ts    id: 'test-jupyterlab-tour:welcome',    label: 'Welcome Tour',    hasHelpEntry: true,    steps: [  // Step must be of type IStep - see src/tokens.ts      {        content:          'The following tutorial will point out some of the main UI components within JupyterLab.',        placement: 'center',        target: '#jp-main-dock-panel',        title: 'Welcome to Jupyter Lab!'      },      {        content:          'This is the main content area where notebooks and other content can be viewed and edited.',        placement: 'left-end',        target: '#jp-main-dock-panel',        title: 'Main Content'      }    ],    // can also define `options`  }})) as ITourHandler;if ( tour ) {  app.commands.execute('jupyterlab-tour:launch', {    id: 'test-jupyterlab-tour:welcome',    force: false  // Optional, if false the tour will start only if the user have not seen or skipped it  })}```&gt; One example is available on [Mamba navigator](https://github.com/mamba-org/gator/blob/master/packages/labextension/src/index.ts#L76).&gt; Test it on [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mamba-org/gator/master?urlpath=lab).If you want to react to step changes to trigger elements of the UI (like opening sidebar), you can connectto the `stepChanged` signal. Building from the previous example, this snippet will open the filebrowserafter the first step.```ts  tour.stepChanged.connect((_, data) =&gt; {    switch (data.type) {      case 'step:after':        if (data.step.target === '#jp-main-dock-panel') {          commands.execute('filebrowser:activate');        }        break;    }  });```&gt; `data` is an object of type [`CallbackProps`](https://docs.react-joyride.com/callback).## Disabling the User and Default ToursIf you _only_ wish to see the default _Welcome_ and _Notebook_ tours, or onesdefined by users, they can be disabled via the command line or a well-known file.The examples below disable all tours not provided by third-party extensions.Adding `jupyterlab-tour:plugin` to either of these will disable tours altogether!### Disabling Tours from the Command LineFrom the command line, run:```bashjupyter labextension disable &quot;jupyterlab-tour:user-tours&quot;jupyter labextension disable &quot;jupyterlab-tour:default-tours&quot;```### Disabling Tours with `pageConfig.json`Create a [pageConfig.json] and put it in _the right place_, e.g.`{sys.prefix}/etc/jupyter/labconfig/pageconfig.json` and add the plugin IDs to`disabledExtensions`.```json{  &quot;disabledExtensions&quot;: {    &quot;jupyterlab-tour:user-tours&quot;: true,    &quot;jupyterlab-tour:default-tours&quot;: true,  }}```[pageConfig.json]: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/directories.html#labconfig-directories## Uninstall```bashpip uninstall jupyterlab-tour```or```bashconda remove -c conda-forge jupyterlab-tour```## Contributing### Development installNote: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.```bash# Clone the repo to your local environment# Change directory to the jupyterlab-tour directory# Install package in development modepip install -e .# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLabjupyter labextension develop . --overwrite# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changesjlpm run build```You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.```bash# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when neededjlpm run watch# Run JupyterLab in another terminaljupyter lab```With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).By default, the `jlpm run build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:```bashjupyter lab build --minimize=False```</longdescription>
