This version uses its own separate data storage and access credentials. ## UsageDisplay help and list of commands.```shell script$ hca-util -husage: hca-util [-h] [--version] [--profile PROFILE] {config,create,select,list,upload,download,delete} ...hca-utiloptional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  --version, -v         show program's version number and exit  --profile PROFILE     use PROFILE instead of default 'hca-util' profilecommand:  {config,create,select,list,upload,download,delete}    config              configure AWS credentials    create              create an upload area (authorised users only)    select              select or show the active upload area    list                list contents of the area    upload              upload files to the area    download            download files from the area    delete              delete files from the area```In the above, optional arguments are between `[]` and choices between `{}`.The basic usage is as follows:```shell script$ hca-util cmd ARG1 ARG2 -o1 -o2```Use the tool by specifying a command (`cmd` - see list below) to run, any mandatory (positional) arguments (e.g. `ARG1` and `ARG2` - see positional args for each command), and any optional arguments (e.g. `-o1` and `o2` - see options for each command).## CommandsHelp with specific command:```shell script$ hca-util &lt;cmd&gt; -h```Some commands or options/flags are restricted to authorised users (admin) only.## `config` commandConfigure AWS credentials```shell script$ hca-util config ACCESS_KEY SECRET_KEYpositional arguments:  ACCESS_KEY         AWS Access Key ID  SECRET_KEY         AWS Secret Access Key```The tool uses the profile name _hca-util_ in local AWS config files.Once configured, the set up can be checked by running the command again, this time without credentials (`hca-util config`), to verify if the previously entered credentials are valid or not.## `create` commandCreate an upload area **(authorised users only)**```shell script$ hca-util create NAME [-p {u,ud,ux,udx}]positional arguments:  NAME               name for the new areaoptional arguments:  -p {u,ud,ux,udx}   allowed actions (permissions) on new area. u for                     upload, x for delete and d for download. Default is ux```## `select` commandShow or select the active upload area```shell script$ hca-util select AREApositional arguments:  AREA                area uuid. ```If AREA is not specified, the selected area is shown.## `list` commandList contents of selected area```shell script$ hca-util list [-b]optional arguments:  -b                 list all areas in bucket **(authorised users only)**```## `upload` commandUpload files to the selected area```shell script$ hca-util upload PATH [PATH ...] [-o]positional arguments:  PATH               valid file or directoryoptional arguments:  -o                  overwrite files with same names```## `download` commandDownload files from the selected area```shell script$ hca-util download (-a | -f file [file ...])optional arguments:  -a                  download all files from selected area  -f file [file ...]  download specified file(s) only```## `delete` commandDelete files from the selected area```shell script$ hca-util delete [-a | -d] [PATH [PATH ...]]positional arguments:  PATH               path to file or directory to deleteoptional arguments:  -a                 delete all files from the area  -d                 delete upload area and contents (authorised users only)```## `sync` commandTransfer files from the selected area to Ingest upload area```shell script$ hca-util sync INGEST_UPLOAD_AREApositional arguments:  INGEST_UPLOAD_AREA  Ingest upload area```INGEST_UPLOAD_AREA format: `s3://org-hca-data-archive-upload-_ENV_/_UUID_/`# DevelopersDownload dependencies```pip install -r requirements.txt```Run ```shell scriptpython3 -m ait.commons.util```Run tests```shell scriptnosetests```</longdescription>
