	<longdescription>Velociraptor Python Library===========================[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/velociraptor-python/badge/?version=latest)](https://velociraptor-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)[Velociraptor](http://github.com/pelahi/velociraptor-stf) catalogues providea signifciant amount of information, but applying units to it can be painful.Here, the `unyt` python library is used to automatically apply units tovelociraptor data and perform generic halo-catalogue reduction. This libraryis primarily intended to be used on [SWIFT](http://swiftsim.com) data thathas been post-processed with velociraptor, but can be used for anyvelociraptor catalogue.The internals of this library are based heavily on the internals of the[`swiftsimio`](http://github.com/swiftsim/swiftsimio) library, and essentiallyallow the velociraptor catalogue to be accessed in a lazy, object-orientedway. This enables users to be able to reduce data quickly and in acomputationally efficient manner, without having to resort to using the`h5py` library to manually load data (and hence manually apply units)!Requirements------------The velociraptor library requires:+ `unyt` and its dependencies+ `h5py` and its dependencies+ `python3.6` or aboveNote that for development, we suggest that you have `pytest` and `black`installed. To create the plots in the example directory, you will needthe plotting framework `matplotlib`.Installation------------You can install this library from PyPI using:```pip3 install velociraptor```Documentation-------------Full documentation is available on [ReadTheDocs](https://velociraptor-python.readthedocs.io/).Why a custom library?---------------------This custom library, instead of something like `pandas`, allows us toonly load in the data that we require, and provide significantcontext-dependent features that would not be available for somethinggeneric. One example of this is the automatic labelling of properties,as shown in the below example.```pythonfrom velociraptor import loadfrom velociraptor.tools import get_full_labelcatalogue = load(&quot;/path/to/catalogue.properties&quot;)stellar_masses = catalogue.apertures.mass_star_30_kpcstellar_masses.convert_to_units(&quot;msun&quot;)print(get_full_label(stellar_masses))```This outputs &quot;Stellar Mass $M_*$ (30 kpc) $\left[M_\odot\right]$&quot;, which iseasy to add as, for example, a label on a plot.</longdescription>
