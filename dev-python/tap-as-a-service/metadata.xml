	<longdescription>================Tap as a Service================Tap-as-a-Service (TaaS) is an extension to the OpenStack network service (Neutron).It provides remote port mirroring capability for tenant virtual networks.Port mirroring involves sending a copy of packets entering and/or leaving oneport to another port, which is usually different from the original destinationsof the packets being mirrored.This service has been primarily designed to help tenants (or the cloud administrator)debug complex virtual networks and gain visibility into their VMs, by monitoring thenetwork traffic associated with them. TaaS honors tenant boundaries and its mirrorsessions are capable of spanning across multiple compute and network nodes. It servesas an essential infrastructure component that can be utilized for supplying data to avariety of network analytics and security applications (e.g. IDS).* Free software: Apache license* API Reference: https://opendev.org/openstack/tap-as-a-service/src/branch/master/API_REFERENCE.rst* Source: https://opendev.org/openstack/tap-as-a-service/* Bugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/tap-as-a-serviceFor installing Tap-as-a-Service with Devstack please read the INSTALL.rst file</longdescription>
