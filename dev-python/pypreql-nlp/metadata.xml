	<longdescription>## PreQL NLPNatural language interface for generating PreQL query objects.PreQL is easier for a large language model to interact with as it requires only extract relevant concepts from a text,classifying them as metrics or dimensions, and mapping them to what is available in a model.This makes it more testable and less prone to hallucination than generating SQL directly. Requires setting the following environment variables- OPENAI_API_KEY- OPENAI_MODELRecommended to use &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot; or higher as the model.## Examples### Basic BQ example```pythonfrom trilogy_public_models import modelsfrom preql import Executor, Dialectsfrom preql_nlp import build_query# define the model we want to parseenvironment = models[&quot;bigquery.stack_overflow&quot;]# set up preql executor# default bigquery executor requires local default credentials configuredexecutor = Dialects.BIGQUERY.default_executor(environment= environment)# build a query off text and the selected modelprocessed_query = build_query(    &quot;How many questions are asked per year?&quot;,    environment,)# make sure we got reasonable outputsfor concept in processed_query.output_columns:    print(concept.name)# and run that to get our answerresults = executor.execute_query(processed_query)for row in results:    print(row)```## Don't Expecct PerfectionResults are non-determistic and may not always be accurate.```sql# generated from prompt: What is Taylor Swift's birthday? How many questions were asked on that day in 2020?SELECT    question.count,    answer.creation_date.year,    question.creation_date.year,    question.creation_date,WHERE    question.creation_date.year = 1989ORDER BY    question.count desc,    question.count descLIMIT 100;```## Setting Up Your EnvironmentRecommend that you work in a virtual environment with requirements from both requirements.txt and requirements-test.txt installed. The latter is necessary to runtests (surprise). Pypreql-nlp is python 3.10+</longdescription>
