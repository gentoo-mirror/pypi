	<longdescription>## POC-POETRY-PARTIFACT-PLUGINThis project is a poetry plugin that wraps the `poetry add/install` commands and adds some logicthat will authenticate to AWS CodeArtifact under the hood.Before any poetry `add` or `install` commands are run, this plugin will check the `pyproject.toml` filefor any codeartifact sources.It is looking for the first `tool.poetry.source` block that contains `.codeartifact.` in its url. The required fields are &quot;url&quot; and &quot;name.&quot;If the tool doesn't find any valid source blocks, nothing happens.## ConfigurationCreate a `tool.poetry.source` block in your `pyproject.toml` file, then set the &quot;url&quot; to the CodeArtifact repository url, and set the &quot;name&quot; to the id of the AWS profile you'll be using to authenticate.Here's an example of a valid `tool.poetry.source` block (the `default=true` is optional):```yaml[[tool.poetry.source]]name = &quot;&lt;your-aws-profile-name&gt;&quot;url = &quot;https://&lt;your-domain-name&gt;-&lt;your-project-id&gt;.d.codeartifact.&lt;your-region&gt;.amazonaws.com/pypi/&lt;your-repo-name&gt;/simple/&quot;default = true```## InstallationTo install the plugin, run this command:```shellpoetry self add poc-poetry-partifact-plugin```## UninstallationTo remove the plugin, run this command:```shellpoetry self remove poc-poetry-partifact-plugin```## Under the HoodOnce the plugin has gotten your repository url and the name of the AWS profile you'll be using, it  uses the AWS profile credentials located at `~/.aws/credentials` to make an API request to your AWS CodeArtifact repository.If this request is successful, a short-lived token will be returned that will grant temporary access.This token is set as a [poetry environment variable](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#using-environment-variables) and allows poetry to seamlessly authenticate to the repository.## Dependencies* [partifact](https://github.com/Validus-Risk-Management/partifact)</longdescription>
