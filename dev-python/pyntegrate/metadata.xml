The documentation can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/index.html), [here](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html), and [here](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html).## Why use C Extensions?The main benefit of using C Extensions would be the speed of C, with a slight penalty, when translating between C and Python.## How to Build or InstallTo build from source, use `python3 setup.py build`.To install from source, use `python3 setup.py install`.To install using pip, use `pip install pyntegrate`## Installation`git clone https://github.com/rtsfred3/pyntegrate.git``python3 setup.py install`### License```Copyright 2021 Ryan FredricksonLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;);you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.You may obtain a copy of the License at   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, softwaredistributed under the License is distributed on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.See the License for the specific language governing permissions andlimitations under the License.```</longdescription>
