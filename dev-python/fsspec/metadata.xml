Various optionally supported features might require specification of customextra require, e.g. `pip install fsspec[ssh]` will install dependencies for `ssh` backends support.Use `pip install fsspec[full]` for installation of all known extra dependencies.Up-to-date package also provided through conda-forge distribution:```bashconda install -c conda-forge fsspec```## PurposeTo produce a template or specification for a file-system interface, that specific implementations should follow,so that applications making use of them can rely on a common behaviour and not have to worry about the specificinternal implementation decisions with any given backend. Many such implementations are included in this package,or in sister projects such as `s3fs` and `gcsfs`.In addition, if this is well-designed, then additional functionality, such as a key-value store or FUSEmounting of the file-system implementation may be available for all implementations &quot;for free&quot;.## DocumentationPlease refer to [RTD](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)## Developfsspec uses GitHub Actions for CI. Environment files can be foundin the &quot;ci/&quot; directory. Note that the main environment is called &quot;py38&quot;,but it is expected that the version of python installed be adjustable atCI runtime. For local use, pick a version suitable for you.### TestingTests can be run in the dev environment, if activated, via ``pytest fsspec``.The full fsspec suite requires a system-level docker, docker-compose, and fuseinstallation. If only making changes to one backend implementation, it isnot generally necessary to run all tests locally.It is expected that contributors ensure that any change to fsspec does notcause issues or regressions for either other fsspec-related packages suchas gcsfs and s3fs, nor for downstream users of fsspec. The &quot;downstream&quot; CIrun and corresponding environment file run a set of tests from the dasktest suite, and very minimal tests against pandas and zarr from thetest_downstream.py module in this repo.### Code Formattingfsspec uses [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable) to ensurea consistent code format throughout the project.Run ``black fsspec`` from the root of the filesystem_spec repository toauto-format your code. Additionally, many editors have plugins that will apply``black`` as you edit files. ``black`` is included in the ``tox`` environments.Optionally, you may wish to setup [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com) toautomatically run ``black`` when you make a git commit.Run ``pre-commit install --install-hooks`` from the root of thefilesystem_spec repository to setup pre-commit hooks. ``black`` will now be runbefore you commit, reformatting any changed files. You can format withoutcommitting via ``pre-commit run`` or skip these checks with ``git commit--no-verify``.</longdescription>
