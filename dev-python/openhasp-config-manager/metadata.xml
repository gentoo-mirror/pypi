I am in theprocess of adding tests to everything to make it more reliable and have also added lots of features along the way.However, there are definitely still a couple of things that do not yet work as intended. Error logsmight need some love to be able to figure out what you did wrong. If you like theproject, feel free to open an issue or PR to help me out.# How to use## Docker```docker run -it --rm \  --name openhasp-config-manager \  --user 1000:1000 \  -v &quot;./openhasp-configs:/app/openhasp-configs&quot; \  -v &quot;./output:/app/output&quot; \  ghcr.io/markusressel/openhasp-config-manager```## InstallationSince openhasp-config-manager needs some dependencies (see [here](/pyproject.toml)) it is**recommended to install it inside a virtualenv**.### venv-install[venv-install](https://github.com/markusressel/venv-install) is a little helper tool to eas theinstallation, management and usage of python cli tools in venvs.```bashvenv-install openhasp-config-manager openhasp-config-manageropenhasp-config-manager -h```### Manual```bashmkdir -p ~/venvs/openhasp-config-managerpython3 -m venv ~/venvs/openhasp-config-managersource ~/venvs/openhasp-config-manager/bin/activatepip3 install openhasp-config-manager```And to use it:```shellsource ~/venvs/openhasp-config-manager/bin/activateopenhasp-config-manager -hopenhasp-config-manager analyze -c &quot;./openhasp-configs&quot;...```### Uninstall```bashdeactivaterm -rf ~/venvs/openhasp-config-manager```## Configurationopenhasp-config-manager is first and foremost a configurationmanagement system. Simply follow the basic folder structure andconfig deployment will become trivial. **Please read all of this,as it is very important to understand the basic structure onwhich everything relies.**### Folder StructureThe following folders should reside inside a single parentfolder, f.ex. named `openhasp-configs`. This folder can belocated anywhere you like, but must be accessible toopenhasp-config-manager when executing.* `common`: The `common` subdirectory can be used for files  that should be included on _all_ device. This folder is optional.* `devices`: The `devices` folder is required. It must contain one  subfolder for each openHASP device you want to configure using  openhasp-config-manager. It is recommended to name subfolders according  to the physical devices associated with them.    * `touch_down_1` (example device folder)        * A device folder contains `*.jsonl`, `*.cmd` and other files which should          only be uploaded to that particular device.        * You can create arbitrary nested folder structures for organizing the files.          There is a limit to the file name length though,          see [FAQ](#output-file-name-length-must-not-exceed-30-characters)        * You must provide a `config.json` file, see [config.json](#config.json)          for more info.A more advanced configuration layout could look something like this:```textopenhasp-configs├── common│   ├── content│   │   └── card.jsonl│   ├── dialog│   │   ├── connected.jsonl│   │   └── offline.jsonl│   ├── navigation_bar.jsonl│   └── page_header.jsonl└── devices    └── touch_down_1        ├── 0_home        │   ├── 0_header.jsonl        │   ├── 1_content.jsonl        │   └── page.cmd        ├── 5_about        │   ├── 0_header.jsonl        │   ├── 1_content.jsonl        │   └── page.cmd        ├── boot.cmd        ├── config.json        ├── offline.cmd        └── online.cmd```### config.jsonopenhasp-config-manager makes use of the `config.json` on your plate. It can extract informationfrom it to detect things like screen orientation, and also allows you to deploy changes within the`config.json` file. Since [the official API does not supportuploading the full file](https://github.com/HASwitchPlate/openHASP/issues/363), only settingswhich can also be set through the web ui on the plate itself are currently supported.To retrieve the initial version of the `config.json` file you can use thebuilt-in file browser integrated into the webserver of your openHASP plate, see[official docs](https://www.openhasp.com/latest/faq/?h=web#is-there-a-file-browser-built-in).The official `config.json` file doesn't provide enough info for openhasp-config-managerto enable all of its features though. To fix that simply add a section to thefile after downloading it:```json{  &quot;openhasp_config_manager&quot;: {    &quot;device&quot;: {      &quot;ip&quot;: &quot;192.168.5.134&quot;,      &quot;screen&quot;: {        &quot;width&quot;: 320,        &quot;height&quot;: 480      }    }  },  &quot;wifi&quot;: {    &quot;ssid&quot;: &quot;Turris IoT&quot;,    ...  }```### Config File Preprocessingopenhasp-config-manager runs all configuration files through various preprocessors, which allow us to usefeatures the original file formats do not support by themselves, like f.ex. templating.#### Multiline JSONL filesWhile the JSONL file format requires each object to be on a single line, openhasp-config-managerallows you to add as many line breaks as you wish. This makes it much easier to edit, since a configlike this:```json{  &quot;page&quot;: 0,  &quot;id&quot;: 31,  &quot;obj&quot;: &quot;msgbox&quot;,  &quot;text&quot;: &quot;%ip%&quot;,  &quot;auto_close&quot;: 5000}```will be deployed like this:```json lines{  &quot;page&quot;: 0,  &quot;id&quot;: 31,  &quot;obj&quot;: &quot;msgbox&quot;,  &quot;text&quot;: &quot;%ip%&quot;,  &quot;auto_close&quot;: 5000}```#### CommentsNeither JSON nor JSONL allows comments, but openhasp-config-manager does!You can mark comments by prefixing them with a double forward-slash:```json5// File description{  // Object Description  &quot;page&quot;: 0,  &quot;id&quot;: 31,  // Property Description  &quot;obj&quot;: &quot;msgbox&quot;,  &quot;text&quot;: &quot;%ip%&quot;,  &quot;auto_close&quot;: 5000}```#### TemplatingYou can use Jinja2 templates inside all jsonl object values. To access the value of another object in atemplate, you can use the `pXbY` syntax established by openHASP, where `X` is the `page` of an object and`Y` is its `id`. openhasp-config-manager even tries to resolve templates that lead to other templates.Be careful not to create loops in this way though.You can use the full functionality of Jinja2 like f.ex. math operations, function calls or type conversions.```yaml{  &quot;page&quot;: 1,  &quot;id&quot;: 1,  &quot;x&quot;: 0,  &quot;y&quot;: 0,  ...}  {    &quot;page&quot;: 1,    &quot;id&quot;: 2,    &quot;x&quot;: &quot;{{ p1b1.x }}&quot;,    &quot;y&quot;: &quot;{{ p1b1.y + 10 }}&quot;,    ...  }```#### VariablesBesides accessing other objects, you can also define custom variables yourself, which can thenbe referenced inside of templates. Variables are defined using `*.yaml` files. If youdecided to use a subfolder structure to organize your configuration files you can use these foldersto also set the scope of variables. More specific variable definitions (longer path) will overrideless specific ones.##### GlobalGlobal variables can be specified by creating `*.yaml` files inside the root config folder (f.ex. `openhasp-configs`).Example:`openhasp-configs/global.vars.yaml````yamlabout:  page_title: &quot;About&quot;```To access this variable, use a Jinja2 template:`openhasp-configs/common/about_page.jsonl````json lines{  &quot;page&quot;: 9,  &quot;id&quot;: 1,  ...  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;{{ about.page_title }}&quot;,  ...}```##### Device specificDevice specific variables can be specified by creating `*.yaml` files inside any of the sub-foldersof a `device` folder.&gt; **Note**&gt;&gt; Device specific variables will override global variables, given the same name.Example:`openhasp-configs/device/my_device/device.vars.yaml````yamlpage_title: &quot;My Device&quot;````openhasp-configs/device/my_device/some_folder/some_page.jsonl````json lines{  &quot;page&quot;: 1,  &quot;id&quot;: 1,  ...  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;{{ page_title }}&quot;,  ...}````openhasp-configs/device/my_device/some_other_folder/some_page.jsonl````json lines{  &quot;page&quot;: 2,  &quot;id&quot;: 1,  ...  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;{{ page_title }}&quot;,  ...}```#### Printing variablesIf you are not sure what variables are accessible in a given path, you can use the `vars`command, which will give you a copy&amp;paste ready output of all variables for agiven directory:```shell&gt; openhasp-config-manager vars -c openhasp-configs -p devices/touch_down_1/homecommon.navbar.first_page: 1common.navbar.last_page: 4...header.title: Home```## DeploymentTo deploy your configurations to the already connected openHASP devices, simply use the`generate`, `upload` or `deploy` commands of `openhasp-config-manager`.&gt; **Note**&gt; openhasp-config-manager needs direct IP access as well as an enabled webservice on the plate&gt; to be able to deploy files to the device. To enable the webservice&gt; try: `openhasp-config-manager cmd -d plate35 -C service -p &quot;start http&quot;`## Run commandsWhile openhasp-config-manager is first and foremost a config management system,it also allows you to run commands on a device by issuing MQTT messages without the need to install a separateMQTT client first. Note that the MQTT _server_ still needs to be running and also has tobe reachable from your local machine for this to work.For a list of possible commands to send to a device, take a look at the officialdocumentation: https://openhasp.haswitchplate.com/latest/commands/```shell&gt; openhasp-config-manager cmd -c ./openhasp-configs -d plate35 -C backlight -p &quot;{\&quot;state\&quot;:\&quot;on\&quot;,\&quot;brightness\&quot;:128}&quot;```# FAQ## How do I see device logs?Try the `logs` command (this does require network access to the device):```shell&gt; openhasp-config-manager logs -d plate35```If that doesn't work, open a terminal and run the following command with the device connected via USB cable:```shellbash -c &quot;screen -q -L -Logfile device.log /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 &amp;&gt; /dev/null; tail -F device.log; killall screen&quot;```## Output file name length must not exceed 30 charactersIf you want to organize your files (both common and device-specific ones) you cansimply create subfolders to achieve your desired structure. However, due to a technicallimitation openHASP does not support subfolder on the actual device. To overcomethis limitation openhasp-config-manager will automatically generate a file name forfiles in subfolders before uploading them to the device. `.json` or `.cmd` files within subfolderswill be renamed by concatenating their full subpath using an underscore (`_`) as a separator. So f.ex.the file in the following structure:```textopenhasp-configs└── devices    └── touch_down_1        └── 0_home            └── 0_header.jsonl```would be uploaded to the `touch_down_1` device with the name `0_home_0_header.jsonl`.# ContributingGitHub is for social coding: if you want to write code, I encourage contributionsthrough pull requests from forks of this repository.
