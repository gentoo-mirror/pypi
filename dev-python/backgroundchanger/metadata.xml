	<longdescription># Background ChangerA small program in Python 3 that grabs a random photo from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) according to your screen resolution and sets it as your background.## Further testingThis hasn't yet been tested on Windows or Mac ([being worked on](https://github.com/rugglcon/python-backgroundchanger/issues/1)), but it works for Ubuntu Linux. Any commands I might have gotten wrong to set it as your background, please feel free to fix those or add more!## DependenciesThis is pretty light on dependencies, but you will need to make sure you have a couple things:* `tkinter` - a python GUI toolkit, but is only used to get the screen resolution. This is usually installed via a system package.* `requests` - python module for HTTP requests.* `pywal` - generates color schemes and used for changing the wallpaper.### Optional Dependencies* `feh`, if you use a Linux system that's not Ubuntu or Elementary OS. This is not in PyPi, it'll be in your distros repos.## Installation and Usage&gt; **NOTE:** For Mac, first test if you have `tkinter` directly installed with your Python version first:&gt; ```sh&gt; python3&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; import tkinter&gt; ```&gt; If that doesn't cause an error, you're good. If it does, follow [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60469203/9565946) Stack Overflow Post to get that correctly set up. Then you can continue with the installation:```shpip install backgroundchanger```## Usage```shbackgroundchanger# To view the help menubackgroundchanger -h# orbackgroundchanger --help```## How to contribute?For issue and PR guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).</longdescription>
