	<longdescription>===============================================================devpi-client: manage devpi-server, Python packaging and testing===============================================================The ``devpi`` command line tool is typically used in conjunctionwith `devpi-server &lt;https://pypi.org/project/devpi-server/&gt;`_.It allows to upload, test and install packages from devpi indexes.See https://doc.devpi.net for quickstart and more documentation.Support=======If you find a bug, use the `issue tracker at Github`_.For general questions use `GitHub Discussions`_ or the `devpi-dev@python.org mailing list`_.For support contracts and paid help contact ``mail at pyfidelity.com``... _issue tracker at Github: https://github.com/devpi/devpi/issues/.. _devpi-dev@python.org mailing list: https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/devpi-dev.python.org/.. _GitHub Discussions: https://github.com/devpi/devpi/discussions=========Changelog=========.. towncrier release notes start6.0.4 (2023-04-13)==================Bug Fixes---------- Fix precedence of URL from command line over DEVPI_INDEX environment variable for ``devpi use``.- Fix relative DEVPI_INDEX environment variable with user and index causing an invalid URL in some cases.- Fix persistence of username when DEVPI_INDEX environment variable is used with ``devpi login``.- Fix precedence of ``--sdist`` and ``--wheel`` over ``formats`` setting from setup.cfg ``[devpi:upload]`` section.6.0.3 (2023-02-20)==================Bug Fixes---------- Fix #919: Retry 3 times and wait a moment on PermissionError during file removal to fix race condition after running tox.- Restore ability to build docs if project uses separate build and source directories for documentation.- Fix for changes in pypitoken 6.x.6.0.2 (2022-09-28)==================Bug Fixes---------- Better error message when trying to use ``devpi index`` which requires authentication (devpi-lockdown).6.0.1 (2022-08-16)==================Bug Fixes---------- fix #913: ``main.Hub.workdir`` cleanup (exit) can now handle read-only files (like those created by git).- Print info when ``DEVPI_INDEX`` environment variable is in use and allow relative index specification for it.6.0.0 (2022-07-19)==================Deprecations and Removals-------------------------- Removed support for ``--detox`` option.- When uploading we no longer &quot;register&quot; the package first. That requirement was removed from PyPI and devpi-server for some time.- Use ``sphinx-build`` command instead of ``setup.py build_sphinx`` when building documentation.- Removed tox dependency, instead ``devpi test`` looks for the ``tox`` binary in the path.- The ``--venv`` option will abort when no virtualenv exists at the location, it will not create a virtualenv anymore.Features--------- Fix #218: use new pip.conf location by default and warn if the legacy location exists.- Fix #38: add ``--user``/``-u`` option to ``use`` command to limit index listing to a specific user.- Fix #437: when the ``DEVPI_INDEX`` environment variable is set, it temporarily overwrites the current index.- Fix #691: allow anonymous uploads if the server has ``acl_upload=:ANONYMOUS:`` set on index.- Fix #863: allow ``--only-docs`` upload for files containing ``.docs.`` instead of ``.doc.`` and support gzipped tar files.- The ``--user/-u`` option for ``devpi use`` can be used to switch the current user and the authentication data of previous logins is preserved.- Use `build &lt;https://pypi.org/project/build/&gt;`_ package when possible and fall back to ``setup.py`` only for deprecated release types.- When the ``DEVPI_USER`` environment variable is set, it temporarily overwrites the current user name.- Support query strings on ``path`` for ``getjson`` command. This enables using ``?no_projects=``.- The ``devpi index -l [username]`` command now actually lists indexes of other users and works without login.- Fix #443 and #444: pass authentication info to pip via environment variable for ``devpi install`` and ``devpi test``.- When pushing to an external index with ``pypi:...``, a PyPI token is detected and ``pypitoken`` is installed a new unique time limited token is derived for the upload.- With ``devpi use --local`` a local configuration is created in the currently active virtualenv and automatically used as long as the virtualenv is activated.- Warn if the server changes the scheme, host or port during ``devpi use``.- Using ``--list`` or ``--urls`` with ``use`` command and a URL won't change the current index anymore.- Existing authentication data is validated on ``devpi use`` and removed if expired.Bug Fixes---------- Fix #562: encode username and url in devpiclient_get_password with sys.stdout.encoding.- Fix #627: support ``--index`` option when no index is currently selected.- Fix #808: Use mkdtemp from Python tempfile module to prevent permission and locking errors during ``devpi test`` and ``devpi upload``.- Fix #831: only download matching wheels if ``--select`` is in use.- Give helpful error message when specified/configured virtualenv is missing.Other Changes-------------- When there is no json error message only the HTML error code and reason is printed now, to get the full HTML output use the ``--debug`` flag.</longdescription>
