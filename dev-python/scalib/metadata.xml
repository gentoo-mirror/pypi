	<longdescription>Welcome to SCALib=================.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/scalib.svg    :target: https://pypi.org/project/scalib/    :alt: PyPI.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/scalib/badge/?version=stable    :target: https://scalib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/    :alt: Documentation Status.. image:: https://img.shields.io/matrix/scalib:matrix.org    :target: https://matrix.to/#/#scalib:matrix.org    :alt: Matrix roomThe Side-Channel Analysis Library (SCALib) is a Python package thatcontains state-of-the-art tools for side-channel security evaluation. It focuses on- simple interface,- state-of-the art algorithms,- excellent performance (see `benchmarks &lt;https://github.com/cassiersg/SCABench&gt;`_).SCALib should be useful for any side-channel practitionner who wants toevaluate, but not necessarily attack, protected or non-protectedimplementations.See the documentation_ for the list of implemented tools.We have a `matrix chat &lt;https://matrix.to/#/#scalib:matrix.org&gt;`_ forannouncements, questions, community support and discussions... _documentation: https://scalib.readthedocs.io/en/stableInstall=======SCALib is on PyPi! Simple install:.. code-block::    pip install scalibWe provide pre-built wheels for any recent python on Linux and Windows (x86).Be sure to use a **recent pip**.For other plateforms, this will build SCALib (see below for dependencies).Local build-----------To get **best performance**, you want to build locally (this will optimizeSCALib for your CPU).**Depdendencies:** You need a C/C++ compiler and the latest stablerelease of the `rust toolchain &lt;https://rustup.rs/&gt;`_.To install from source:.. code-block::    git clone https://github.com/simple-crypto/SCALib    cd SCALib    pip install .Usage=====See `API documentation &lt;https://scalib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#available-features&gt;`_,`example &lt;https://github.com/simple-crypto/scalib/tree/main/examples&gt;`_ and`real-world usages &lt;https://scalib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#concrete-evaluations&gt;`_.Alternatives============If your needs are not covered by SCALib, you might be more lucky with `lascar &lt;https://github.com/Ledger-Donjon/lascar&gt;`_ or `scared &lt;https://gitlab.com/eshard/scared&gt;`_.Please also let us know your needs by opening a `feature request &lt;https://github.com/simple-crypto/SCALib/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=feature_request.md&amp;title=&gt;`_.Versioning policy=================SCALib uses `semantic versioing &lt;https://semver.org/&gt;`_, see the `CHANGELOG&lt;CHANGELOG.rst&gt;`_ for breaking changes and novelties.About us========SCALib was initiated by Olivier Bronchain and Gaëtan Cassiers during their PhDat UCLouvain. It is now developed as a project of`SIMPLE-Crypto &lt;https://www.simple-crypto.dev/&gt;`_ and maintained by Gaëtan Cassiers (@cassiersg).Contributions and Issues========================Contributions welcome !Please file a **bug report** for any issue you encounter (even bad documentation isa bug !), and let us know your **suggestions** (open a `github issue&lt;https://github.com/simple-crypto/SCALib/issues/new/choose&gt;`_, email works too).We also welcome code contributions, see `CONTRIBUTING.rst &lt;CONTRIBUTING.rst&gt;`_.You can also come discuss on `matrix &lt;https://matrix.to/#/#scalib:matrix.org&gt;`_.All code contributions are subject to the Contributor License Agreement (`CLA&lt;https://www.simple-crypto.dev/organization&gt;`_) of SIMPLE-Crypto, which ensuresa thriving future for open-source hardware security.License=======This project is licensed under GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 3.See `COPYRIGHT &lt;COPYRIGHT&gt;`_ and `COPYING &lt;COPYING&gt;`_ for more information.For licensing-related matters, please contact info@simple-crypto.dev.Acknowledgements================This work has been funded in part by the Belgian Fund for Scientific Research(F.R.S.-FNRS) through the Equipment Project SCALAB, by the European Union (EU)and the Walloon Region through the FEDER project USERMedia (convention number501907-379156), and by the European Union (EU) through the ERC project 724725(acronym SWORD).</longdescription>
