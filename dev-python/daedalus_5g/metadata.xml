	<longdescription># Blue TeamThe following directory has a series of tools that are used for defending and building out environments for running scenarios in.# 4G/5G Environment Creation Tool## Dependencies- Linux with a recent kernel- Docker- python3 and pip3- uhd-host (`sudo apt-get install -y uhd-host`)## InstallationThe main tool in this directory is called `daedalus` and can be installed with easily with pip:```pip3 install daedalus-5g```or locally:```git clone https://github.com/IQTLabs/Daedaluscd Daedalus/bluesudo python3 setup.py install```Once installed, you can simply execute `daedalus` and you will be prompted for the 4G/5G environments you'd like it to create.** Note **```AMD64 CPUs must support SSE4.1, AVX, AVX2, and FMA. If you don't have those, you can alternatively try starting daedalus with -b which will build the images locally and might work.ARM64 CPUs don't have those requirements, but you will need g++ when pip installing for grpc.```</longdescription>
