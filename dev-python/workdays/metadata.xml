	<longdescription>Extend python datetime with excel-like workday addition/subtraction    functionality:    NETWORKDAYS(start_date,end_date,holidays)    Returns the number of whole working days between start_date and    end_date (inclusive of both start_date and end_date). Working days    exclude weekends and any dates identified in holidays. Use NETWORKDAYS    to calculate employee benefits that accrue based on the number of    days worked during a specific term.    WORKDAY(start_date,days,[holidays])    Returns a number that represents a date that is the indicated number    of working days before or after a date (the starting date). Working    days exclude weekends and any dates identified as holidays. Use    WORKDAY to exclude weekends or holidays when you calculate invoice    due dates, expected delivery times, or the number of days of work    performed.    This module has similarities with the BusinessHours module - you may    want to check it out as well to see which one better fits your needs.</longdescription>
