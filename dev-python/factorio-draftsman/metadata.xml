equivalent to 'draftsman-update -v -p some/path'```Both `mod-info.json` and `mod-settings.dat` are recognized by `draftsman-update`, so you can also just change the settings in either of those and the loading process will adjust as well.## TODO* Add warnings for placement constraints on rails, rail signals and train stops* Add constraints on `UpgradePlanner` and `DeconstructionPlanner`* `Blueprint.schedules` convenience functions* More doctests* Add documentation on report and contributing* Write test cases for `dump_format`* Add plaintext representations of Entity JSON objects for all entities in addition to blueprintables* Update modding documentation guide to reflect 2.0 changes* Reevaluate the diamond diagrams for inherited `Entity` subclass* Figure out exactly what determines if an `Entity` is flip-able or not* Maybe add interface so that mods can include files that can be loaded with Draftsman? (this would be neat)* Split documentation from docstrings so that each function has a more readable example* RailPlanner (specify rail paths via turtle-like commands)* Custom `data.raw` extraction and formatting?* Maybe integrate defaults for more succinct blueprint strings?* Unify entity validation into one monolithic thing* Investigate more performant alternatives to `schema` (validir? requires cython, currently we're pure python)* Look into Lua (or other language) bindings via backport to C/Cython</longdescription>
