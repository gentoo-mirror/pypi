	<longdescription># bodo_jupyterlab![Github Actions Status](https://github.com/Bodo-inc/jupyterlab-extensions.git/workflows/Build/badge.svg)A JupyterLab extension for use on the Bodo Cloud Platform.The extension has two components: a frontend component (see files in `src`) and a server component (see files in `bodo_jupyterlab`).## Requirements- JupyterLab &gt;= 3.0## InstallTo install the extension, execute:```bashpip install bodo_jupyterlab```## UninstallTo remove the extension, execute:```bashpip uninstall bodo_jupyterlab```## Contributing### Development installNote: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.You also need to first install our fork of remote-ikernel: https://github.com/Bodo-inc/remote_ikernel```bashsudo chown bodo:bodo -R /opt# Make sure you have nodejs installed. # If you don't have mamba installed: conda install -c conda-forge mamba. mamba install -c conda-forge nodejs=16.12# Clone the repo to your local environment# Install package in development modepip install -e .# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLabjupyter labextension develop . --overwrite# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changesjlpm run build# Enable itjupyter server extension enable bodo_jupyterlabjupyter lab extension enable bodo_jupyterlab```You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.```bash# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when neededjlpm run watch# Run JupyterLab in another terminaljupyter lab```With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).By default, the `jlpm run build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:```bashjupyter lab build --minimize=False```### Development uninstall```bashpip uninstall bodo_jupyterlab```In development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`command. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`folder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `bodo-jupyterlab` within that folder.### Packaging the extensionSee [RELEASE](RELEASE.md)</longdescription>
