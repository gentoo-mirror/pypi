Note that if you are going to propose major changes, be sure to open an issue for discussion first, to make sure that your PR will be accepted before you spend effort coding it.Questions/Comments------------------Another posterior plotting tool?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    This is my posterior plotter. There are many like it, but this one is mine.There are several excellent tools for plotting marginalised posteriors:- `getdist &lt;http://getdist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html&gt;`__- `corner &lt;https://corner.readthedocs.io&gt;`__- `pygtc &lt;https://pygtc.readthedocs.io&gt;`__- `dynesty &lt;https://dynesty.readthedocs.io&gt;`__- `MontePython &lt;http://baudren.github.io/montepython.html&gt;`__Why create another one? In general, any dedicated user of software will find that there is some functionality that in their use case is lacking, and the designs of previous codes make such extensions challenging. In my case this was:1. For large numbers of samples, kernel density estimation is slow, or inaccurate (particularly for samples generated from nested sampling). There are kernel density estimators, such as `fastKDE &lt;https://pypi.org/project/fastkde/&gt;`__, which ameliorate many of these difficulties.2. Existing tools can make it difficult to define new parameters. For example, the default cosmomc chain defines ``omegabh2``, but not ``omegab``. The transformation is easy, since ``omegab = omegabh2/ (H0/100)**2``, but implementing this transformation in existing packages is not so trivial. ``anesthetic`` solves this issue by storing the samples as a pandas array, for which the relevant code for defining the above new parameter would be.. code:: python    from anesthetic import read_chains    samples = read_chains(file_root)               # Load the samples    label = 'omegab'    tex = '$\Omega_b$'    h = (samples.H0/100)    samples[(label, tex)] = samples.omegabh2/h**2  # Define omegab    samples.plot_1d('omegab')                      # Simple 1D plot3. Many KDE plotting tools have conventions that don't play well with uniformly distributed parameters, which presents a problem if you are trying to plot priors along with your posteriors. ``anesthetic`` has a sensible mechanism, by defining the contours by the amount of iso-probability mass they contain, but colouring the fill in relation to the probability density of the contour.What's in a name?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~There is a convention for naming nested sampling packages with words that have nest in them (`nestle and dynesty &lt;https://dynesty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`__, `nestorflow &lt;https://bitbucket.org/tomcharnock/nestorflow&gt;`__). Doing a UNIX grep:.. code:: bash    grep nest /usr/share/dict/wordsyields a lot of superlatives (e.g. greenest), but a few other cool names for future projects:- amnesty- defenestrate- dishonestly- inestimable- minestrone- rhinestoneI chose ``anesthetic`` because I liked the soft 'th', and in spite of the US spelling.</longdescription>
