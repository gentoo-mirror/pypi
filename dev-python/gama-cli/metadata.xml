	<longdescription># GAMA CLI![GAMA CLI](./docs/gama_cli.png)Publicly available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/gama-cli/) for convenience but if you don't work at Greenroom Robotics, you probably don't want to use this.## Install* For development:  * `pip install -e ./libs/gama_config`  * `pip install -e ./tools/gama_cli`* For production: `pip install gama-cli`* You may also need to `export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin` if you don't have `~/.local/bin` in your path* Install autocomplete:  * bash: `echo 'eval &quot;$(_GAMA_CLI_COMPLETE=bash_source gama)&quot;' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc`  * zsh: `echo 'eval &quot;$(_GAMA_CLI_COMPLETE=zsh_source gama)&quot;' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc` (this is much nicer)## Usage* `gama --help` to get help with the CLI### GroundstationInstalling a GAMA on a groundstation is as simple as this:* `mkdir ~/gama &amp;&amp; cd ~/gama`* `gama authenticate` to authenticate with the GAMA package registry* `gama gs configure` to configure GAMA on a groundstation* `gama gs install` to install GAMA on a groundstation* `gama gs up` to start GAMA on a groundstation* `gama gs down` to stop GAMA on a groundstation### VesselInstalling a GAMA on a vessel is as simple as this:* `mkdir ~/gama &amp;&amp; cd ~/gama`* `gama authenticate` to authenticate with the GAMA package registry* `gama vessel configure` to configure GAMA on a vessel* `gama vessel install` to install GAMA on a vessel* `gama vessel up` to start GAMA on a vessel* `gama vessel down` to stop GAMA on a vessel## Dev modeGAMA CLI can be ran in dev mode.
