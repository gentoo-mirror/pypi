	<longdescription># _spyrograph_: elegant mathematics and geometries&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;media/rgb.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Animation of three geometric, symmetrical shapes being drawn next to one another left to right. The shape on the left is red, the middle green, and the right is blue.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;## What is it?_spyrograph_ is a lightweight Python package that provides an expressive and flexible set of tools for drawing beautiful mathematically driven art. With just a few lines of easy-to-read code you can start analyzing, visualizing, and exploring elegant mathematics [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/spyrograph?period=total&amp;units=international_system&amp;left_color=grey&amp;right_color=brightgreen&amp;left_text=downloads)](https://pepy.tech/project/spyrograph)[![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/chris-greening/spyrograph)](https://github.com/chris-greening/spyrograph/issues)[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/chris-greening/spyrograph)](LICENSE)[![Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/spyrograph?color=brightgreen)](https://pypi.org/project/spyrograph/)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/spyrograph/badge/?version=latest)](https://spyrograph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)[![&quot;Buy Me A Coffee&quot;](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/chrisgreening)[Official website](https://chris-greening.github.io/spyrograph/)[Official docs](https://spyrograph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)## Table of Contents* [Key features](#key-features)* [Installation](#installation)* [Quickstart](#quickstart)* [Contributing](#contributing)* [Blog posts](#blog-posts)* [Documentation](#documentation)* [License](#license)* [Support](#support)---## :key: Key features &lt;a name=&quot;key-features&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;- Expressive and consistent syntax- Robust underlying mathematics- Beginner _and_ expert friendly- `numpy` is the only required third-party installation- Clear visualizations and animations- Flexible to a wide range of usecases- Lightweight, just plug and play&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;media/sample_drawing.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Sample hypotrochoid drawing showing a circle rolling around the interior of another circle drawing a geometric shape&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;---## :computer: Installation &lt;a name=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;### pipInstall the latest stable release from PyPI using```shell$ pip3 install spyrograph```or clone the development version from GitHub with```shell$ git clone https://github.com/chris-greening/spyrograph.git```---## :seedling: Quickstart &lt;a name=&quot;quickstart&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;`spyrograph` is designed to be expressive and easy-to-use - simply `import spyrograph` and jump right into drawing elegant, complex shapes in just a few lines of code!```pythonfrom spyrograph import Hypotrochoid# Trace a hypotrochoid from 0 to 2pi where# the fixed circle radius is 300, rolling circle # radius is 200, and the distance from the rolling # circle is 100hypotrochoid = Hypotrochoid(    R=300,    r=200,    d=100,    thetas=np.arange(0, 2*np.pi, .1))hypotrochoid.trace(    show_circles=True,     frame_pause=.05,     circle_color=&quot;grey&quot;)```---## :pray: Contributing &lt;a name=&quot;contributing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome!Feel free to [open an Issue](https://github.com/chris-greening/spyrograph/issues/new/choose), check out existing [Issues](https://github.com/chris-greening/spyrograph/issues), or [start a discussion](https://github.com/chris-greening/spyrograph/discussions).
