Currently, most scientific publications are made with LaTeX andpublished in PDF format. While the capabilities of LaTeX and related software areundeniable, there are many pitfalls. RSM aims to cover this gap.## What RSM does differentlyOne of the main aims of the RSM suite is to provide scientists with tools to authorscientific manuscripts in a format that is web-ready in a transparent, native way thatis both easy to use and easy to learn.  In particular, RSM is a suite of tools thatallow the user to write a plain text file (in a special `.rsm` format) and convert thefile into a web page (i.e. a set of .html, .css, and .js files).  These files can thenbe opened natively by any web browser on any device.  In the rest of this README, and inthe documentation, the files output by RSM are referred to as *the document*, or *theoutput document*.## FeaturesRSM's output document has the following features:1. Responsive: its geometry and layout adapt to the device it is being read on.2. Accessible: the user is free to change the geometry, layout, typography and other   settings of a RSM document.3. Separation of concerns: internally, the structure and content of an RSM document are   separate from the style and look-and-feel.  The former are stored in HTML format,   while the latter are treated with CSS and Javascript.4. Interactive: RSM documents support context-relevant tooltips, embedded video or   animations, enhanced document navigation, smart search, content folding, smart   context menus, and many other opportunities for interaction.5. Extensible: potential to extend using the entire ecosystem of modern web technologies## ComponentsThe RSM framework is comprised of several components, each of which can be used inisolation, though using them in unison yields best results.1. **The RSM file format, `.rsm`** is a format that allows writers to produce technical   documents that get rendered directly into web-ready formats. RSM is a plain text   format so you can edit a .`rsm` file with your favorite text editor. Fundamentally,   the `.rsm` file format is essentially an extension of the `.rst` file format.1. **The RSM project** is simply a folder that contains a `.rsm` file and its `.html`   output.  When sharing your RSM document, you should always share *the entire* RSM   folder, not just one file.2. **rsm-edit, the RSM text editor,** is a text editor specifically designed to edit   `.rsm` files. Besides having basic text editing features, rsm-edit has features   specific to producing `.rsm` files.  *Currently work in progress.*3. **rsm-view, the RSM reader,** is a file viewer specifically designed to show `.rsm`   files. It is essentially a web browser, though it has some extra features.   *Currently work in progress.*4. **rsm-make, the RSM command line utility,** is for now the main way to execute all the   core functionality of the RSM framework.## Basic usageOne of the objectives of the RSM project is to make it possible to produce and sharedocuments that can be viewed easily at any time anywhere, without restriction of device,software, software versions, operating system, internet connection, etc. Therefore, theonly required component is a `.rsm` file. An basic `.rsm` file can be produced with anytext editor, and it can be viewed on any modern web browser, even without internetconnection.## Advanced usageAdditionally to the basic features, the RSM project also provides advanced features thatdo require the adoption of some of the other components. For example, writers using the`.rsm` format may find it useul to use rsm-edit. Accordingly, some of the features ofrsm-edit can only be fully enjoyed by readers via rsm-view.Adopting the rsm-edit and rsm-view is not necessarily the most accessiblething. However, the project is currently in proof-of-concept stage. If it proves to be auseful tool and the community starts adopting it, then care will be placed to guaranteethat adopting the rsm-view and rsm-edit tools is as easy and accessible aspossible. Specifically, there should be cloud versions of both tools where all that'snecessary is an internet connection.&lt;!-- ## Design philosophy --&gt;&lt;!-- The RSM project follows a set of principles. Features are designed with these principles --&gt;&lt;!-- in mind. If you think a feature could be improved, or a new feature could be --&gt;&lt;!-- implemented, following these principles, please get in touch. --&gt;&lt;!-- 1. RSM documents should be easily readable in any device, regardless of screen size, --&gt;&lt;!--    operating system, or internet connection. --&gt;&lt;!-- 2. RSM documents should ship with the source code that generated them. --&gt;&lt;!-- ## Under the hood --&gt;&lt;!-- -&gt; Only show what the writer intended to show, unless the writer asks for more via --&gt;&lt;!-- &quot;details on demand&quot; interactions. For example don't show menus, buttons, other things --&gt;&lt;!-- unless the reader is hovering or selecting somehow --&gt;## Related projectsThis is a list of other projects or ideas that have inspired RSM or are somehow related.+ https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/proof.pdf+ https://github.com/Mathpix/mathpix-markdown-it+ distill.pub&lt;!-- # -- Remember ----------------------------------------------------------- --&gt;&lt;!-- # the doctree is the model, the html/css is the view --&gt;&lt;!-- # as much as possible, only use margin-bottom --&gt;&lt;!-- # Use margins when pushing blocks away from each other --&gt;&lt;!-- # Use padding when pushing things into their own block --&gt;&lt;!-- # only use JS for complex selectors and adding/removing classes --&gt;&lt;!-- # anything more complicated goes to rsm-read (exception tooltips/tree) --&gt;&lt;!-- Only show what the writer intended to show, unlews the writer asks for more via &quot;details --&gt;&lt;!-- on demand&quot; interactions. For example don't show menus, buttons, other things unless the --&gt;&lt;!-- reader is hovering or selecting somehow --&gt;&lt;!-- + mathematical writing should be accessible, as opposed to obfuscated by notation, --&gt;&lt;!--   convention, or implicit assumption --&gt;&lt;!-- + the core will NOT be extended for aesthetic purposes. All aesthetics will be handled --&gt;&lt;!--   via CSS. We want to avoid a situation like LaTeX where migrating from one journal --&gt;&lt;!--   template to another is a PITA --&gt;&lt;!-- + learn Lean, but remember RSM is about publishing, writing, and reading, not about --&gt;&lt;!--   proof checking/assisting --&gt;&lt;!-- + Lean is about checking correctness, RSM is about making a proof easy to read for a human --&gt;&lt;!-- + Lean is about writing/checking math, RSM is about publishing/sharing math --&gt;&lt;!-- + the proof markup language (PMUL) should be writeable by hand, if at all possible --&gt;&lt;!-- + quote Mason Porter: 'a proof should _always_ have accompanying prose' --&gt;&lt;!-- + quote Lamport: 'get to a level where every step is obviously true, and then go one --&gt;&lt;!--   level further' --&gt;&lt;!-- + write a short paper for a math education or math software meeting --&gt;&lt;!-- + the document should only show what the writer intended, all other bells and whistles --&gt;&lt;!--   should only happen &quot;on demand&quot;, when the reader requests them --&gt;&lt;!-- + the core extensions should take care of the model, the theme should take care of the --&gt;&lt;!--   view. In particular, all css and js belongs to the theme --&gt;&lt;!-- + the UI should be seamless and out of your way. The user should be able to hide --&gt;&lt;!--   navigations/menus/buttons and maximize screen real state to show CONTENT. --&gt;&lt;!-- + from Conor: how to date/timestamp versions of a web-paper? --&gt;</longdescription>
