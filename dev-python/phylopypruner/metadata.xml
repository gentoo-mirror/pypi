Unfortunately,contaminants present in even a single taxon can cause a tree-based orthologyinference method to erroneuosly infer paralogy and unnecessarily excludesequences.PhyloPyPruner is a Python package for phylogenetic tree-based orthologyinference, using the species overlap method. It uses trees and alignmentsinferred from the output of a graph-based orthology inference approach, suchas [OrthoMCL](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12952885),[OrthoFinder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26243257) or[HaMStR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19586527), in order to obtain setsof sequences that are 1:1 orthologous. In addition to algorithms seen inpre-existing tree-based tools (for example,[PhyloTreePruner](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3825643/),[UPhO](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/33/8/2117/2578877),[Agalma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3840672/) or[Phylogenomic DatasetReconstruction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25158799)), this packageprovides new methods for reducing potential contamination.![proteomes2orthologs](https://gitlab.com/fethalen/phylopypruner/raw/master/doc/images/proteomes2orthologs.png)**Figure 1.** A rough overview of a tree-based orthology inference approach.## Quick installationThe easiest way to install PhyloPyPruner is by using the package manager forPython, [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):```bashpip install phylopypruner # install for all userspip install --user phylopypruner # install for the current user only```Once installed, the program is located within `$HOME/.local/bin`. Depending onyour OS, you might have to add the directory to your `$PATH` to avoid typingthe entire path. Once in your path, you run the program like this:```bashphylopypruner```## [Documentation](https://gitlab.com/fethalen/phylopypruner/wikis)1.
