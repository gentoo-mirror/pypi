Client apps (sometimes called 'skids') can reuse these classes for common use cases. The code modules are oriented around each step in the extract, transform, and load process.`palletjack` works with pandas DataFrames (either regular for tabular data or Esri's spatially-enabled dataframes for spatial data). The extract and transform methods return dataframes and the load methods consume dataframes as their source data.The [documentation](https://agrc.github.io/palletjack/palletjack) includes a user guide along with an API description of the available classes and methods.Pallet jack: [forklift's](https://www.github.com/agrc/forklift) little brother.## Dependencies`palletjack` relies on the dependencies listed in `setup.py`. These are all available on PyPI and can be installed in most environments, including Google Cloud Functions.The `arcgis` library does all the heavy lifting for spatial data. If the `arcpy` library is not available (such as in a cloud function), it relies on `shapely` for its geometry engine.## Installation1. Activate your application's environment1. `pip install ugrc-palletjack`## Quick start1. Import the desired modules1. Use a class in `extract` to load a dataframe from an external source1. Transform your dataframe as desired with helper methods from `transform`1. Use the dataframe to update a hosted feature service using the methods in `load`   ```python   from palletjack import extract, transform, load   #: Load the data from a Google Sheet   gsheet_extractor = extract.GSheetLoader(path_to_service_account_json)   sheet_df = gsheet_extractor.load_specific_worksheet_into_dataframe(sheet_id, 'title of desired sheet', by_title=True)   #: Convert the data to points using lat/long fields, clean for uploading   spatial_df = pd.DataFrame.spatial.from_xy(input_df, x_column='longitude', y_column='latitude')   renamed_df = transform.DataCleaning.rename_dataframe_columns_for_agol(spatial_df)   cleaned_df = transform.DataCleaning.switch_to_nullable_int(renamed_df, ['an_int_field_with_null_values'])   #: Truncate the existing feature service data and load the new data   gis = arcgis.gis.GIS('my_agol_org_url', 'username', 'super-duper-secure-password')   updates = palletjack.load.FeatureServiceUpdater.truncate_and_load_features(      gis, 'feature_service_item_id', cleaned_df, r'c:\directory\to\save\truncated\data\in\case\of\error'   )   ```## Development1. Create a conda environment with Python 3.9   - `conda create -n palletjack python=3.9`   - `activate palletjack`1. Clone the repo1. Install in dev mode with development dependencies   - `pip install -e .[tests]`### Troubleshooting Weird Append ErrorsIf a `FeatureLayer.append()` call (within a load.FeatureServiceUpdater method) fails with an &quot;Unknown Error: 500&quot; error or something like that, you can query the results to get more info. The debug log will include the HTTP GET call, something like the following:`https://services1.arcgis.com:443 POST /&lt;unique string&gt;/arcgis/rest/services/&lt;feature layer name&gt;/FeatureServer/&lt;layer id&gt;/append/jobs/&lt;job guid&gt;?f=json token=&lt;crazy long token string&gt;`You can use this and a token from an AGOL tab to build a new job status url. To get the token, log into AGOL in a browser and open a private hosted feature layer item. Click the layer, and then open the developer console. With the Network tab of the console open, click on the &quot;View&quot; link for the service URL. You should see a document in the list whose name includes &quot;?token=&lt;really long token string&gt;&quot;. Copy the name and then copy out the token string.Now that you've got the token string, you can build the status query:`https://services1.arcgis.com/&lt;unique string&gt;/arcgis/rest/services/&lt;feature layer name&gt;/FeatureServer/&lt;layer id&gt;/append/jobs/&lt;job guid&gt;?f=json&amp;&lt;token from agol&gt;`Calling this URL in a browser should return a message that will hopefully give you more info as to why it failed.</longdescription>
