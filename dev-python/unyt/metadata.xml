Afunction might return an array but at least with plain NumPy arrays, there is noway to easily tell what the units of the data are without somehow knowing *apriori*.The ``unyt`` package (pronounced like &quot;unit&quot;) provides a subclass of NumPy's``ndarray`` class that knows about units. For example, one could do:    &gt;&gt;&gt; import unyt as u    &gt;&gt;&gt; distance_traveled = [3.4, 5.8, 7.2] * u.mile    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(distance_traveled.to('km'))    [ 5.4717696  9.3341952 11.5872768] kmAnd a whole lot more! See `the documentation &lt;http://unyt.readthedocs.io&gt;`_ forinstallation instructions, more examples, and full API reference.This package only depends on ``numpy`` and ``sympy``.  Notably, it does *not*depend on ``yt`` and it is written in pure Python.Code of Conduct---------------The ``unyt`` package is part of `The yt Project&lt;https://yt-project.org&gt;`_. Participating in ``unyt`` development thereforehappens under the auspices of the `yt community code of conduct&lt;http://yt-project.org/doc/developing/developing.html#yt-community-code-of-conduct&gt;`_. Iffor any reason you feel that the code of conduct has been violated, please sendan e-mail to confidential@yt-project.org with details describing theincident. All emails sent to this address will be treated with the strictestconfidence by an individual who does not normally participate in yt development.License-------The unyt package is licensed under the BSD 3-clause license.Citation--------If you make use of unyt in work that leads to a publication we would appreciatea mention in the text of the paper or in the acknowledgements along with acitation to our `paper&lt;https://joss.theoj.org/papers/dbc27acb614dd33eb02b029ef20e7fe7&gt;`_ in theJournal of Open Source Software.
