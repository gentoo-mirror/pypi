	<longdescription>pyFAI: Fast Azimuthal Integration in Python===========================================Main development website: https://github.com/silx-kit/pyFAI|Github Actions| |Appveyor Status| |myBinder Launcher| |RTD docs| |Zenodo DOI|PyFAI is an azimuthal integration library that tries to be fast (as fast as Cand even more using OpenCL and GPU).It is based on histogramming of the 2theta/Q positions of each (center of)pixel weighted by the intensity of each pixel, but parallel version uses aSparseMatrix-DenseVector multiplication.Neighboring output bins get also a contribution of pixels next to the borderthanks to pixel splitting.Finally pyFAI provides also tools to calibrate the experimental setup using Debye-Scherrerrings of a reference compound.References----------* The philosophy of pyFAI is described in the proceedings of SRI2012: https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/425/20/202012* Implementation in parallel is described in the proceedings of EPDIC13: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0885715613000924* Benchmarks and optimization procedure is described in the proceedings of EuroSciPy2014: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1412.6367* Calibration procedures are described in J. Synch. Radiation 2020: https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600577520000776Installation------------With PIP........As most Python packages, pyFAI is available via PIP::   pip install pyFAI[gui]It is advised to run this in a vitural environment.Provide the *--user* to perform an installation local to your user (not recommended).Under UNIX, you may have to run the command via *sudo* to gain root access anperform a system wide installation (neither recommended).With conda..........pyFAI is also available via conda::  conda install pyfai -c conda-forgeTo install conda please see either `conda &lt;https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html&gt;`_ or `Anaconda &lt;https://www.continuum.io/downloads&gt;`_.From source code................The latest release of pyFAI can be downloaded from`Github &lt;https://github.com/silx-kit/pyFAI/archive/main.zip&gt;`_.Presently the source code has been distributed as a zip package.Download it one and unpack it::    unzip pyFAI-main.zipAs developement is also done on Github,`development branch is also available &lt;https://github.com/silx-kit/pyFAI/archive/main.zip&gt;`_All files are unpacked into the directory pyFAI-main::    cd pyFAI-mainBuild it &amp; test it::    python3 run_tests.pyFor its tests, pyFAI downloads test images from the internet.Depending on your network connection and your local network configuration,you may have to setup a proxy configuration like this (no more needed at ESRF)::   export http_proxy=http://proxy.site.org:3128Finally, install pyFAI in the virtualenv after testing it::    pip install --upgrade .The newest development version can also be obtained by checking out from the gitrepository::    git clone https://github.com/silx-kit/pyFAI.git    cd pyFAI    pip install --upgrade .If you want pyFAI to make use of your graphic card, please install`pyopencl &lt;http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyopencl&gt;`_Documentation-------------Documentation can be build using this command and Sphinx (installed on your computer)::    python3 build-doc.pyDependencies------------Python 3.7, ... 3.10 are well tested and officially supported.For full functionality of pyFAI the following modules need to be installed.* ``numpy``      - http://www.numpy.org* ``scipy``  - http://www.scipy.org* ``matplotlib`` - http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/* ``fabio``  - http://sourceforge.net/projects/fable/files/fabio/* ``h5py``     - http://www.h5py.org/* ``pyopencl`` - http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyopencl/* ``pyqt5``     - http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro* ``silx``       - http://www.silx.org* ``numexpr``    - https://github.com/pydata/numexprThose dependencies can simply be installed by::   pip install -r requirements.txtUbuntu and Debian-like Linux distributions------------------------------------------To use pyFAI on Ubuntu/Debian the needed python modulescan be installed either through the Synaptic Package Manager(found in System -&gt; Administration)or using apt-get on from the command line in a terminal::   sudo apt-get install pyfaiThe extra Ubuntu packages needed are:* ``python3-numpy``* ``python3-scipy``* ``python3-matplotlib``* ``python3-dev``* ``python3-fabio``* ``python3-pyopencl``* ``python3-pyqt5``* ``python3-silx``* ``python3-numexpr``using apt-get these can be installed as::    sudo apt-get build-dep pyfaiMacOSX------One needs to install `Python` (&gt;=3.7) and `Xcode` prior to start installing pyFAI.The compiled extension will use only one core due to the limitation of the compiler.OpenCL is hence greately adviced on Apple systems.Then install the missing dependencies with `pip`::   pip install -r requirements.txtWindows-------Under Windows, one needs to install `Python` (&gt;=3.7) and the Visual Studio C++ compiler.Then install the missing dependencies with `pip`::   pip install  -r requirements.txtGetting help------------A mailing-list, pyfai@esrf.fr, is available to get help on the program and how to use it.One needs to subscribe by sending an email to sympa@esrf.fr with a subject &quot;subscribe pyfai&quot;.Maintainers-----------* Jérôme Kieffer (ESRF)Contributors------------* Valentin Valls (ESRF)* Frédéric-Emmanuel Picca (Soleil)* Thomas Vincent (ESRF)* Dimitris Karkoulis (ESRF)* Aurore Deschildre (ESRF)* Giannis Ashiotis (ESRF)* Zubair Nawaz (Sesame)* Jon Wright (ESRF)* Amund Hov (ESRF)* Dodogerstlin @github* Gunthard Benecke (Desy)* Gero Flucke (Desy)Indirect contributors (ideas...)--------------------------------* Peter Boesecke* Manuel Sánchez del Río* Vicente Armando Solé* Brian Pauw* Veijo Honkimaki.. |Github Actions| image:: https://github.com/silx-kit/pyFAI/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg.. |Appveyor Status| image:: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/silx-kit/pyfai?svg=true   :target: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ESRF/pyfai.. |myBinder Launcher| image:: https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg   :target: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/silx-kit/pyFAI/main?filepath=binder%2Findex.ipynb.. |RTD docs| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyFAI/badge/?version=main    :alt: Documentation Status    :scale: 100%    :target: https://pyfai.readthedocs.io/en/main/?badge=main.. |Zenodo DOI| image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.832896.svg   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.832896</longdescription>
