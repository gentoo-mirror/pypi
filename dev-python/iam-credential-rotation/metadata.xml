Rotating credentials usually means deleting the existing credentials and then generating new ones. But what happens if you delete an existing set of credentials while there is a current automated job or pipeline running?When the machine account has two sets of credentials, with the most recent set being the credentials available in the secrets store (which is where automated jobs fetch credentials when they start). You can confidently delete the older of the two credentials, generate new credentials, and update the secrets store with the new, with no fear of causing any system failure. Both the new credentials and the prior credentials used by any jobs still in flight will remain valid until the next rotation. By setting a rotation window at 1/2 (or less) the desired time period then both keys are replaced within the period. Additional [discussion](discussion.md).  ## Install```bashpip install iam-credential-rotation```## Usage```Usage: iam-credential-rotation [OPTIONS] PATH  For machine account AWS IAM Users on PATH, perform credential rotation using  CURRENT/LAST two-key pattern. Outputs list of updated users/credentials for  processing and storage in secure location.Options:  -o, --outfile TEXT  Write results to TEXT file  --version           Show the version and exit.  --help              Show this message and exit.```For example:  If machine users are stored on the path `users/PSKServiceAccounts/` then the following will rotate each of the IAM Users on that path. _Note that the actual output does not obfuscate the credential information. In normal use, a pipeline or other automated job that performs this rotation would parse the output and write the new credentials into a Secrets store._  ```$ iam-credential-rotation PSKServiceAccounts{  &quot;PSKNonprodServiceAccount&quot;: {    &quot;AccessKeyId&quot;: &quot;AKIARKL**************&quot;,    &quot;SecretAccessKey&quot;: &quot;bCFqIBZUo****************************&quot;  },  &quot;PSKProdServiceAccount&quot;: {    &quot;AccessKeyId&quot;: &quot;AKIARKLI**************&quot;,    &quot;SecretAccessKey&quot;: &quot;cVSkOhunYxS****************************&quot;  }}```### DevelopmentThe pipeline uses `requirements.txt` but there is also a Pipfile if you prefer pipenv for local development.  **Pipenv setup**  ```echo '3.11.3' &gt; .python-version    # using pyenv for version selectionpipenv --python 3.11               # pipenv creates the virtual env  pipenv shell  pipenv install --dev  ```For the build pipeline, the packages build dependencies are also maintained in a `requirements.txt` file since (currently) the generic python build environment already exists on the build executor.  **Run unit tests**  ```PYTHONPATH=.:./src coverage run -m pytest -vv -l  coverage report  ```**build**  ```python -m build```**install locally during development**  ```pip install --editable .```** check setuptools-scm dynamic version**```python -m setuptools_scm```</longdescription>
