This documentation describes currentstate of application functionality.  The application currently supports a set ofstandard archetypes- simple - a basic project shell- cli - for creating command-line interface projects- lib - for developing and publishing a Python librariesSupport for user-defined archetypes is coming. Please check back periodically tosee what's new.If you would like to see updates or additions to the standard archetypes, the templatesare located in the `archetypes`_ directory and are made available to the CLI throughthe `StandardArchetype`_ class. Please submit a PR for review using the instructions inthe `Bugs, Contribution, and Feedback`_  section, or reach out to the author's emaillisted at the bottom of this document... _`archetypes`: https://github.com/inception-tools/inception-tools/tree/develop/inception_tools/data/archetypes/.. _`StandardArchetype`: https://github.com/inception-tools/inception-tools/blob/develop/inception_tools/standard_archetype.pyDocumentation=============Create a new Python project, ready to go, with a single command!Inception-tools is a command-line application designed to create new softwareprojects (in particular, Python-based projects) using a set of standardized projectarchetypes.The base ``inception-tools`` package provides:- Simple command-line invocation for creating &quot;stubbed-out&quot; Python projects,  parameterized through the command-line call.- A set of standard archetypes for common Python project types:    - simple        - Creates a basic project shell.    - cli        - Creates a project shell geared toward developing and publishing a          Python-based command-line application.    - lib        - Creates a project shell geared specifically toward developing and          publishing a Python library- Each standard archetype creates a shell project structure with files,  directories, class and function stubs, completely set up and ready for  publication to PyPI using a standardized set of Makefile targets.Python Package Index:https://pypi.org/project/inception-tools/GitHub Repository:https://github.com/inception-tools/inception-toolsInstallation============Download and install the latest version of this application from the Pythonpackage index (PyPI) as follows:::    pip install inception-toolsNote that ``inception-tools`` has dependencies on the following packages:- ``click``- ``jinja2``These should be automatically installed by ``pip`` using the command-lineabove.Usage=====Once Inception Tools has been installed, you can create a new project shellas follows\:::    it incept package_name [project_root]This will create a new project (using the standard ``application``archetype) under the directory ``project_root`` using additional parametersstored in file ``inception-tools.cfg``\:::    &lt;project_root&gt;/        docs/        &lt;package_name&gt;/            __init__.py            cli.py        scripts/        tests/            __init__.py            end-to-end/                __init__.py            integration/                __init__.py            unit/                __init__.py        LICENSE        Makefile        Pipfile        README.rst        setup.cfg        setup.py``package_name`` (required)    The package name that will used for your new project, e.g.    ``inception_tools``. This will be used to create for the name of the    package, for the name of a stub entry point files, and in the names of    test modules. It will also be used as the relative path for the    ``project_root`` argument in the event that it is omitted (see below).``[project_root]`` (optional) default: package_name    The path to the directory under which your project should be installed,    e.g. ``inception-tools``.    Example `installing to a directory my_package in the current working    directory`::        it incept my_package    Example `installing to a directory called my_project in the user's home    directory`::        it incept my_package ~/my_projectThe following options are also available:``--author-name`` (optional)    The name of the package author, e.g. 'Jane Doe'.  Defaults to '[author-name]'.``--author-email`` (optional)    The email address of the author, e.g. 'jane.doe@inception-tools.org'.``--org-name`` (optional)    The name of the organization sponsoring development for the project, e.g.    'inception-tools'.``--archetype`` (optional)    Determines the archetype used to create the stub project. Defaults to 'cli'. Must be    one of the following:    - simple        - Creates a basic project shell.    - cli        - Creates a project shell geared toward developing and publishing a          Python-based command-line application.    - lib        - Creates a project shell geared specifically toward developing and          publishing a Python libraryLicense=======``inception-tools`` is released under the Apache Software License v2.0 - see the files``LICENSE`` for further details.Bugs, Contribution, and Feedback================================Contributions and feedback are welcome.  Contributions can be made by openinga pull request at the ``inception-tools`` `repository`_ and tagging `@avanherick` forreview.  Please see the `Development` section of this document for code styleand branching guidelines... _`repository`: https://github.com/inception-tools/inception-tools/This project was created to fill what looked like a lack of standardizedconventions practices for structuring Python projects, and out of the desireto avoid the need to manually create the same directory and file structuresover and over again.If you come across this project and know of other project which accomplishsimilar goals, or of documented standards around Python project structure,we would welcome hearing about them.Please submit feedback, bugs, feature requests, and code changes using GitHubat:http://github.com/inception-tools/inception-toolsDevelopment===========Repository Management:    Inception Tools manages its repository using the `GitFlow`_ model... _`GitFlow`: https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/Code style:    Inception Tools code should adhere to the `PEP 8`_ guidelines with the exception    of maximum line length, which instead uses `black`_'s default of 88... _`PEP 8`: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/.. _`black`: https://github.com/psf/blackVersioning:    Inception Tools uses semantic versioning and adheres to the guidelines    specified `here`_... _`here`: https://semver.org/CI/CD:    - All builds are automated through GitHub actions.    - Development builds are executed against the ``develop`` branch.    - Beta builds are executed with each push to the ``master`` branch.    - Release builds are triggered by the creation of a release through GitHub.Changes=======**v0.1.0**- Initial public version:author: Andrew van Herick:email: avanherick@gmail.com:date: 2022-01-03</longdescription>
