	<longdescription>==============================================================cell-tracking-BC: Base Classes for Cell Tracking in Microscopy==============================================================Brief Description=================The ``cell-tracking-BC`` project proposes a set of classes and tools for the processing and analysis of cell microscopy time-lapses/videos, typically in live-cell imaging. Its purpose is to serve as a basis for the development of computational pipelines and applications, for example to detect cell-related events such as division or death.Installation============The ``cell-tracking-BC`` project is published on the `Python Package Index (PyPI) &lt;https://pypi.org&gt;`_ at: `https://pypi.org/project/cell-tracking-bc &lt;https://pypi.org/project/cell-tracking-bc&gt;`_. It requires version 3.8, or newer, of the interpreter. It should be installable from Python distribution platforms or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Otherwise, it can be installed from a command-line console:- For all users, after acquiring administrative rights:    - First installation: ``pip install cell-tracking-bc``    - Installation update: ``pip install --upgrade cell-tracking-bc``- For the current user (no administrative rights required):    - First installation: ``pip install --user cell-tracking-bc``    - Installation update: ``pip install --user --upgrade cell-tracking-bc``Documentation=============The documentation is extremely limited at the moment. It currently takes the form of a `small PDF document &lt;https://gitlab.inria.fr/edebreuv/cell-tracking-bc/-/raw/master/documentation/latex/main.pdf&gt;`_. The tools `pdoc3 &lt;https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc&gt;`_ and `pydoctor &lt;https://github.com/twisted/pydoctor&gt;`_ are also used to generate an `API documentation &lt;https://edebreuv.gitlabpages.inria.fr/cell-tracking-bc&gt;`_.Thanks======The project is developed with `PyCharm Community &lt;https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm&gt;`_.The development relies on several open-source packages (see ``install_requires`` in ``setup.py``).The code is formatted by `Black &lt;https://github.com/psf/black&gt;`_, *The Uncompromising Code Formatter*.The imports are ordered by `isort &lt;https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort&gt;`_... *your imports, so you don't have to*.</longdescription>
