In particular, this library refactors thefragment code from XBlock into a standalone implementation.A Django view subclass called FragmentView is provided which supports threedifferent ways of rendering a fragment into a page:* the fragment can be rendered as a standalone page at its own URL* the fragment can be rendered into another page directly from Django* the fragment can be returned as JSON so that it can be rendered client-sideThe rationale behind this design can be found in `OEP-12`_... _OEP-12: https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architectural-decisions/oep-0012-arch-fragment-views.htmlThe intention is that a client-side implementation will be provided in asubsequent version. This should provide JavaScript code to request fragementsover AJAX and then dynamically update the current page. This logic will be arefactoring of the current implementation in edx-platform for rendering XBlocks.It is also intended that this functionality will enhance the capabilitiesaround dependency loading...
