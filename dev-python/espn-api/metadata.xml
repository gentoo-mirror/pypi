Please feel free to make suggestions, bug reports, and pull request for features or fixes!This package was inspired and based off of [rbarton65/espnff](https://github.com/rbarton65/espnff).## InstallingWith Git:```git clone https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-apicd espn-apipython3 setup.py install```With pip:```pip install espn_api```## Usage### [For Getting Started and API details head over to the Wiki!](https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api/wiki)```python# Football APIfrom espn_api.football import League# Basketball APIfrom espn_api.basketball import League# Hockey APIfrom espn_api.hockey import League# Baseball APIfrom espn_api.baseball import League# Initleague = League(league_id=222, year=2019)```### Run Tests```python3 setup.py nosetests```## [Discussions](https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api/discussions) (new)If you have any questions about the package, ESPN API data, or want to talk about a feature please start a [discussion](https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api/discussions)! ## Issue ReportingIf you find a bug follow the steps below for reporting.1. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api/issues) with a brief description of the bug for the title. In the title also add which sport (Football or Basketball)2. Run the application in debug mode to view ESPN API request's and response's    ```python    # ... import statement above    league = League(league_id=1245, year=2019, debug=True)    ```    The application will print all requests and the response from ESPN's API in the console. I would suggest piping the console output to a text file as it will be a lot of data.3. Find the last log before the crash and copy it in the issue descrption with the line number of the crash or possible bug.4.
