Constructs can be composed together to form higher-level building blocks which represent more complex state.Constructs are often used to represent the *desired state* of cloud applications. For example, in the AWS CDK, which is used to define the desired state for AWS infrastructure using CloudFormation, the lowest-level construct represents a *resource definition* in a CloudFormation template. These resources are composed to represent higher-level logical units of a cloud application, etc.## ContributingThis project has adopted the [Amazon Open Source Code ofConduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct).We welcome community contributions and pull requests.
