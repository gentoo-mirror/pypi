	<longdescription>**Status:** Stable release[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/crafter.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/crafter/#history)# CrafterOpen world survival game for evaluating a wide range of agent abilities withina single environment.![Crafter Terrain](https://github.com/danijar/crafter/raw/main/media/terrain.png)## OverviewCrafter features randomly generated 2D worlds where the player needs to foragefor food and water, find shelter to sleep, defend against monsters, collectmaterials, and build tools. Crafter aims to be a fruitful benchmark forreinforcement learning by focusing on the following design goals:- **Research challenges:** Crafter poses substantial challenges to current  methods, evaluating strong generalization, wide and deep exploration,  representation learning, and long-term reasoning and credit assignment.- **Meaningful evaluation:** Agents are evaluated by semantically meaningful  achievements that can be unlocked in each episode, offering insights into the  ability spectrum of both reward agents and unsupervised agents.- **Iteration speed:** Crafter evaluates many agent abilities within a single  env, vastly reducing the computational requirements over benchmarks suites  that require training on many separate envs from scratch.See the research paper to find out more: [Benchmarking the Spectrum of AgentCapabilities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06780.pdf)```@article{hafner2021crafter,  title={Benchmarking the Spectrum of Agent Capabilities},  author={Danijar Hafner},  year={2021},  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.06780},}```## Play Yourself```shpython3 -m pip install crafter  # Install Crafterpython3 -m pip install pygame   # Needed for human interfacepython3 -m crafter.run_gui      # Start the game```&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Keyboard mapping (click to expand)&lt;/summary&gt;| Key | Action || :-: | :----- || WASD | Move around || SPACE| Collect material, drink from lake, hit creature || TAB | Sleep || T | Place a table || R | Place a rock || F | Place a furnace || P | Place a plant || 1 | Craft a wood pickaxe || 2 | Craft a stone pickaxe || 3 | Craft an iron pickaxe || 4 | Craft a wood sword || 5 | Craft a stone sword || 6 | Craft an iron sword |&lt;/details&gt;![Crafter Video](https://github.com/danijar/crafter/raw/main/media/video.gif)## InterfaceTo install Crafter, run `pip3 install crafter`. The environment follows the[OpenAI Gym][gym] interface. Observations are images of size (64, 64, 3) andoutputs are one of 17 categorical actions.```pyimport gymimport crafterenv = gym.make('CrafterReward-v1')  # Or CrafterNoReward-v1env = crafter.Recorder(  env, './path/to/logdir',  save_stats=True,  save_video=False,  save_episode=False,)obs = env.reset()done = Falsewhile not done:  action = env.action_space.sample()  obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)```[gym]: https://github.com/openai/gym## EvaluationAgents are allowed a budget of 1M environmnent steps and are evaluated by theirsuccess rates of the 22 achievements and by their geometric mean score. Examplescripts for computing these are included in the `analysis` directory of therepository.- **Reward:** The sparse reward is `+1` for unlocking an achievement during  the episode and `-0.1` or `+0.1` for lost or regenerated health points.  Results should be reported not as reward but as success rates and score.- **Success rates:** The success rates of the 22 achievemnts are computed  as the percentage across all training episodes in which the achievement was  unlocked, allowing insights into the ability spectrum of an agent.- **Crafter score:** The score is the geometric mean of success rates, so that  improvements on difficult achievements contribute more than improvements on  achievements with already high success rates.## BaselinesBaseline scores of various agents are available for Crafter, both with andwithout rewards. The scores are available in JSON format in the `scores`directory of the repository. For comparison, the score of human expert playersis 50.5\%. The [baselineimplementations](https://github.com/danijar/crafter-baselines) are available asa separate repository.&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/danijar/crafter/raw/main/media/scores.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;## QuestionsPlease [open an issue][issues] on Github.[issues]: https://github.com/danijar/crafter/issues</longdescription>
