	<longdescription># ocr-opsOCR-Ops is infrastructure to perform Optimal Character Recognition (OCR) at scale on a large number of images and videos.Built on top of the algo-ops framework, OCR-Ops is modular and extensible in its data processing operations.Key Features:* Supports building an OCRPipeline that can utilize multiple popular OCR annotation methods (e.g. PyTesseract, EasyOCR,  etc.) and return the results in structured and efficient fashion within a unified framework.* Enables multi-levels of information of the OCR application (e.g. text-only, bounding boxes, etc.)* Allows definition of an image pre-processing pipeline (before OCR) and a text-cleaning pipeline (after OCR) of  detected but noisy text to enable optimal and robust OCR performance.* Supports several nice presets that are plug-and-play for the above purpose!</longdescription>
