	<longdescription>Welcome to cronomaxrf================&lt;!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! --&gt;Recently my lab, the Rijkserfgoedlaboratorium in Amsterdam, acquired anew Bruker Crono X-Ray Fluorescence spectral image (MACRO-XRF) scanner.This instrument saves its raw data into a specific type of HDF5 fileformat. Currently these files can only be read and converted bycommercially licensed Crono software. This situation restricts access tothe data to a limited number of researchers who can run the software.Furthermore, it is likely that we will loose the ability to read thedata at some point in the future.In order to make optimal use of the Crono data in collaborative researchprojects now and to make sure that we can still read the data in thefuture we need to: 1) understand the Crono HDF5 file format, and 2)develop open software tools available to all researchers for reading andconverting these data files. To support open heritage science`cronomaxrf` package is currently being developed under the GPLv3 opensource software license.For installation instructions, documentation and code see:https://fligt.github.io/cronomaxrf/</longdescription>
