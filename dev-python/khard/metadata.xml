	<longdescription>khard=====Khard is an address book for the Unix console. It creates, reads, modifies andremoves vCard address book entries at your local machine. Khard is alsocompatible to the email clients mutt and alot and the SIP client twinkle. Youcan find more information about khard and the whole synchronization process[here][blog].Warning: If you want to create or modify contacts with khard, beware that thevcard standard is very inconsistent and lacks interoperability. Differentactors in that sector have defined their own extensions and even producenon-standard output. A good example is the type value, which is tied to phonenumbers, email and post addresses. Khard tries to avoid such incompatibilitiesbut if you sync your contacts with an Android or iOS device, expect problems.You are on the safe side, if you only use khard to read contacts. For furtherinformation about the vcard compatibility issues have a look into [this blogpost][sad].Installation------------[![Packaging status][repos-badge]][repos]Khard is already packaged for quite some distributions.
