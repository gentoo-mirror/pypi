To move data between your local (host) machine and the container, you can mount a [volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) with:```docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/data:/home/conda/data ghcr.io/asfhyp3/asf-tools:latest```## Quick Usage### Local Resolution Weighted CompositeThe `make_composite` tool allows you to create a local-resolution-weighted compositefrom a set of Sentinel-1 RTC products ([D. Small, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350465)).It is intended to be used with RTC products generated by [ASF HyP3](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/using/vertex).You will need to request RTC products using the `Include Scattering Area` option,then download and unzip them into an empty directory.To generate a composite of the co-polarization images, navigate to the directorycontaining the unzipped RTC products and run:```make_composite VV-composite */*VV.tif```To generate a composite of the cross-polarization images, navigate to the directorycontaining the unzipped RTC products and run:```make_composite VH-composite */*VH.tif```#### Usage TipBecause the imagery has been radiometrically terrain corrected (RTC), geometric andradiometric distortions have been removed from the files to be composited. One thestrong points of LRW composites is that you combine both ascending and descendingdatatakes into a single product. In this manner no layover or shadow masks arerequired - what is shadowed on an ascending pass is visible in a descending passand vice-versa. Thus, not only is it possible to combine ascending and descending,but it is highly encouraged. Using many datatakes from both the ascending anddescending satellite passes will make the best composites possible.#### About Local Resolution Weighting (LRW)In an LRW composite, each satellite pass contributes to creating the output pixels.The amount of this contribution is scaled by the inverse of the scattering area usedduring terrain correction (thus the need for requesting the area map option of HyP3 RTC).The inverse of the surface scattering area, also referred to as local resolution,is multiplied by each pixel's backscatter value. The results of all of the imagescovering any single pixel are then summed. This total is then divided by the sumof the weights used to get the output average backscatter.### Water extent mapping&gt;[!WARNING]&gt; The HydroSAR codes (`flood_map`, `water_map` and `hand` modules) are being&gt; moved to the [HydroSAR project repository](https://github.com/fjmeyer/hydrosar)&gt; and will be provided in a new pip/conda installable package `hydrosar`.&gt; &gt; The `asf_tools.hydrosar` subpackage will be removed in a future release.The `water_map` tool allows you to create a surface water extent map from a Sentinel-1dual-pol (VV+VH) RTC product. It is intended to be used with RTC products generated by[ASF HyP3](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/using/vertex).Additionally, a HAND (height above nearest drainage) GeoTIFF that is pixel aligned tothe RTC images is required, and preferably derived from the same DEM used to correctthe RTC images -- the quality of the HAND used is directly tied to the quality of theoutput water extent map.To make a water extent map, run:```water_map [OUT_RASTER] [VV_RASTER] [VH_RASTER] [HAND_RASTER]```For more information and to see the options available, see:```water_map --help```For details on the algorithm see the `asf_tools.water_map.make_water_map` docstring.&lt;!-- FIXME: Link to API reference on our docs page! --&gt;### Flood depth mapping&gt;[!WARNING]&gt; The HydroSAR codes (`flood_map`, `water_map` and `hand` modules) are being&gt; moved to the [HydroSAR project repository](https://github.com/fjmeyer/hydrosar)&gt; and will be provided in a new pip/conda installable package `hydrosar`.&gt; &gt; The `asf_tools.hydrosar` subpackage will be removed in a future release.The `flood_map` tool allows you to create an estimated flood depth map from the surfacewater extent map created by the `water_map` tool. Additionally, a HAND (height above nearest drainage) GeoTIFF that is pixel aligned tothe surface water extent map is required. An ideal candidate is the HAND image created by the `water_map` tool. To make a flood depth map, run:```flood_map [OUT_RASTER] [SURFACE_WATER_MAP] [HAND_RASTER]```For more information and to see the options available, see:```flood_map --help```For details on the algorithm see the `asf_tools.flood_map.make_flood_map` docstring.</longdescription>
