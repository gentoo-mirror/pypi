(e.g. `pip install psgshortcut`)To do this, follow these steps:1. Open a command window (I promise, it's the last time you'll need to for this program)2. Type - `where psgdemos`3. Copy the line that `where psgdemos` gave you into the first input of the shortcut maker program4. Run psgdemos by typing `psgdemos` in your command window5. Right click and choose &quot;File Location&quot;6. Copy the file location results, but change the extension from .py to .ico and paste into the Icon file input of the shortcut maker7. Click &quot;Create Shortcut&quot;This will create a shortcut in the same folder as the target file.  You can safely move this shortcut file to any place you want (like to your desktop).  Double-click the shortcut and your program should launch.## Release Notes1.12.1   18-Sep-2022* Hmmm... despite deleting 1.12.0 from PyPI, it complains about reuse, so 12.1.1 it is1.12.0   18-Sep-2022* Bug fix in demo browser when editor set in demo browser and blank is in filenames1.12.0   8-May-2022* **Numerous** updates to the demo programs.

The Demo Browser installed via PyPI is slightly different than the Demo Browser found in the PySimpleGUI Repo.  You can tell the difference by looking at the program's icon.  If it has the PySimpleGUI Emoji as the icon, then it's the pip installed `psgdemo` version.  If the icon is a light bulb, then you're running the version from the PySimpleGUI repo.## ContributingLike the PySimpleGUI project, this project is currently licensed under an open-source license, the project itself is structured like a proprietary product.
