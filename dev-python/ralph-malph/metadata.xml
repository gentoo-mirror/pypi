	<longdescription># RalphRalph is a toolbox for your learning analytics, it can be used as a:- **library**, to fetch learning events from various backends, (de)serialize or    convert them from various standard formats such as    [xAPI](https://adlnet.gov/projects/xapi/), or    [openedx](https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/developers/references/internal_data_formats/tracking_logs/index.html)- **command-line interface** (CLI), to build data pipelines the UNIX-way™️,- **HTTP API server**, to collect xAPI statements (learning events)  following the [ADL LRS  standard](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#partthree).## Quick start guide### Testing the LRS server with Docker compose&gt; Preliminary notes:&gt;&gt; 1. [`curl`](https://curl.se), [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and&gt;    [`docker compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) are required to run&gt;    some commands of this tutorial. Make sure they are installed first.&gt;&gt; 2. In order to run the Elasticsearch backend locally on GNU/Linux operating&gt;    systems, ensure that your virtual memory limits are not too low and&gt;    increase them (temporally) if needed by typing this command from your&gt;    terminal (as `root` or using `sudo`): `sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`&gt;&gt; Reference:&gt; https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/vm-max-map-count.htmlTo bootstrap a test environment on your machine, clone this project first andrun the `bootstrap` Makefile target:```$ make bootstrap```This command will create required `.env` file (you may want to edit it for yourtest environment), build the Ralph's Docker image and start a single nodeElasticsearch cluster _via_ Docker compose.You can check the `elasticsearch` service status using the `status` helper:```bash$ make status# This is an alias for:$ docker compose ps```You may now start the LRS server using:```$ make run-lrs```The server should be up and running at[http://localhost:8100](http://localhost:8100). You can check its status usingthe hearbeat probe:```$ curl http://localhost:8100/__heartbeat__```The expected answer should be:```json{&quot;database&quot;:&quot;ok&quot;}```If the database status is satisfying, you are now ready to send xAPI statementsto the LRS:```$ curl -sL https://github.com/openfun/potsie/raw/main/fixtures/elasticsearch/lrs.json.gz | \  gunzip | \  head -n 100 | \  sed &quot;s/@timestamp/timestamp/g&quot; | \  jq -s . | \  curl -Lk \    --user ralph:secret \    -X POST \    -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \    http://localhost:8100/xAPI/statements/ -d @-```The command above fetches one hundred (100) example xAPI statements from our[Potsie](https://github.com/openfun/potsie) project and sends them to the LRSusing `curl`.You can get them back from the LRS using `curl` to query the`/xAPI/statements/` endpoint:```$ curl -s \    --user ralph:secret \    -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \    http://localhost:8100/xAPI/statements/ \ |  jq```&gt; Note that using `jq` is optional in this case, it is used to improve response&gt; readability. It is not required to install it to run this snippet.### Testing the CLI (Docker)Ralph is distributed as a [Dockerimage](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fundocker/ralph). If[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed on your machine, itcan be pulled from DockerHub:```$ docker run --pull always --rm fundocker/ralph:latest ralph --help```### Testing the CLI (Python)Ralph is distributed as a standard python package; it can be installed _via_`pip` or any other python package manager (_e.g_ Poetry, Pipenv, etc.):```sh# Install the full package$ pip install \    ralph-malph[backend-es,backend-ldp,backend-mongo,backend-swift,backend-ws,cli,lrs]# Install only the core package (library usage without backends, CLI and LRS)$ pip install ralph-malph```If you installed the full package (including the CLI, LRS and supportedbackends), the `ralph` command should be available in your `PATH`. Try toinvoke the program usage thanks to the `--help` flag:```$ ralph --help```You should see a list of available commands and global flags for `ralph`. Notethat each command has its own usage that can be invoked _via_:```$ ralph COMMAND --help```&gt; You should substitute `COMMAND` by the target command, _e.g._ `list`, to see&gt; its usage.## DocumentationWe try our best to maintain an up-to-date reference documentation for thisproject.
