It is a replacement for the &quot;urlview&quot; program.Requires: Python 3.7+ and the python-urwid library## FeaturesUrlscan parses an email message or file and scans it for URLs and emailaddresses. It then displays the URLs and their context within the message, andallows you to choose one or more URLs to send to your Web browser.Alternatively, it send a list of all URLs to stdout.Relative to urlview, urlscan has the following additional features:- Support for emails in quoted-printable and base64 encodings. No more stripping  out =40D from URLs by hand!- The context of each URL is provided along with the URL. For HTML mails, a  crude parser is used to render the HTML into text. Context view can be toggled  on/off with `c`.- URLs are shortened by default to fit on one line. Viewing full URL (for one or  all) is toggled with `s` or `S`.- Jump to a URL by typing the number.- Incremental case-insensitive search with `/`.- Execute an arbitrary function (for example, copy URL to clipboard) instead of  opening URL in a browser.- Use `l` to cycle through whether URLs are opened using the Python webbrowser  module (default), xdg-open (if installed) or opened by a function passed on  the command line with `--run` or `--run-safe`.- Configure colors and keybindings via ~/.config/urlscan/config.json. Generate  default config file for editing by running `urlscan -g`. Cycle through  available palettes with `p`. Set display width with `--width`.- Copy URL to clipboard with `C` or to primary selection with `P`.  Requires  xsel or xclip.- Run a command with the selected URL as the argument or pipe the selected  URL to a command.- Show complete help menu with `F1`. Hide header on startup with `--nohelp`.- Use a custom regular expression with `-E` for matching urls or any  other pattern. In junction with `-r`, this effectively turns urlscan  into a general purpose CLI selector-type utility.- Scan certain email headers for URLs. Currently `Link`, `Archived-At` and  `List-*` are scanned when `--headers` is passed.- Queue multiple URLs for opening and open them all at once with `a` and `o`.## Installation and setupTo install urlscan, install from your distribution repositories (Archlinux),from Pypi, or do a local development install with pip -e:    pip install --user urlscan    OR    cd &lt;path/to/urlscan&gt; &amp;&amp; pip install --user -e .**NOTE**    The minimum required version of urwid is 1.2.1.Once urlscan is installed, add the following lines to your .muttrc:    macro index,pager \cb &quot;&lt;pipe-message&gt; urlscan&lt;Enter&gt;&quot; &quot;call urlscan to    extract URLs out of a message&quot;    macro attach,compose \cb &quot;&lt;pipe-entry&gt; urlscan&lt;Enter&gt;&quot; &quot;call urlscan to    extract URLs out of a message&quot;Once this is done, Control-b while reading mail in mutt will automaticallyinvoke urlscan on the message.To choose a particular browser, set the environment variable BROWSER. If BROWSERis not set, xdg-open will control which browser is used, if it's available.:    export BROWSER=/usr/bin/epiphany## Command Line usage    urlscan OPTIONS &lt;file&gt;    OPTIONS [-c, --compact]            [-d, --dedupe]            [-E, --regex &lt;expression&gt;]            [-f, --run-safe &lt;expression&gt;]            [-g, --genconf]            [-H, --nohelp]            [    --headers]            [-n, --no-browser]            [-p, --pipe]            [-r, --run &lt;expression&gt;]            [-R, --reverse]            [-s, --single]            [-w, --width]            [-W  --whitespace-off]Urlscan can extract URLs and email addresses from emails or any text file.Calling with no flags will start the curses browser. Calling with '-n' will justoutput a list of URLs/email addressess to stdout. The '-c' flag removes thecontext from around the URLs in the curses browser, and the '-d' flag removesduplicate URLs. The '-R' flag reverses the displayed order of URLs and context.Files can also be piped to urlscan using normal shell pipe mechanisms: `cat&lt;something&gt; | urlscan` or `urlscan &lt; &lt;something&gt;`. The '-W' flag condenses thedisplay output by suppressing blank lines and ellipses lines.Instead of opening a web browser, the selected URL can be passed as the argumentto a command using `--run-safe &quot;&lt;command&gt; {}&quot;` or `--run &quot;&lt;command&gt; {}&quot;`. Notethe use of `{}` in the command string to denote the selected URL. Alternatively,the URL can be piped to the command using `--run-safe &lt;command&gt; --pipe` (or`--run`). Using --run-safe with --pipe is preferred if the command supports it,as it is marginally more secure and tolerant of special characters in the URL.## ThemingRun `urlscan -g` to generate ~/.config/urlscan/config.json with the defaultcolor and black &amp; white palettes. This can be edited or added to, as desired.The first palette in the list will be the default. Configure the palettesaccording to the [Urwid display attributes][1].Display width can be set with `--width`.## KeybindingsRun `urlscan -g` to generate ~/.config/urlscan/config.json. All of the keys willbe listed. You can either leave in place or delete any that will not be altered.To unset a binding, set it equal to &quot;&quot;.  For example: `&quot;P&quot;: &quot;&quot;`The follow actions are supported:- `add_url` -- add a URL to the queue (default: `a`)- `all_escape` -- toggle unescape all URLs (default: `u`)- `all_shorten` -- toggle shorten all URLs (default: `S`)- `bottom` -- move cursor to last item (default: `G`)- `clear_screen` -- redraw screen (default: `Ctrl-l`)- `clipboard` -- copy highlighted URL to clipboard using xsel/xclip (default: `C`)- `clipboard_pri` -- copy highlighted URL to primary selection using xsel/xclip (default: `P`)- `context` -- show/hide context (default: `c`)- `del_url` -- delete URL from the queue (default: `d`)- `down` -- cursor down (default: `j`)- `help_menu` -- show/hide help menu (default: `F1`)- `link_handler` -- cycle link handling (webbrowser, xdg-open, --run-safe or --run) (default: `l`)- `open_queue` -- open all URLs in queue (default: `o`)- `open_queue_win` -- open all URLs in queue in new window (default: `O`)- `open_url` -- open selected URL (default: `space` or `enter`)- `palette` -- cycle through palettes (default: `p`)- `quit` -- quit (default: `q` or `Q`)- `reverse` -- reverse display order (default: `R`)- `shorten` -- toggle shorten highlighted URL (default: `s`)- `top` -- move to first list item (default: `g`)- `up` -- cursor up (default: `k`)## Update TLD list (for developers, not users)`wget https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt`## Known bugs and limitations- Running urlscan sometimes &quot;messes up&quot; the terminal background. This seems to  be an urwid bug, but I haven't tracked down just what's going on.- Extraction of context from HTML messages leaves something to be desired.  Probably the ideal solution would be to extract context on a word basis rather  than on a paragraph basis.- The HTML message handling is a bit kludgy in general.- multipart/alternative sections are handled by descending into all the  sub-parts, rather than just picking one, which may lead to URLs and context  appearing twice.
