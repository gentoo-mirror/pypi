This library is intended to be a place for scrapli users to add  additional platform support to scrapli. Please see the main [scrapli repo](https://github.com/carlmontanari/scrapli) for much more information about the main project.#### Key Features:- __Easy__: It's easy to get going with scrapli -- check out the documentation and example links above, and you'll be   connecting to devices in no time.- __Fast__: Do you like to go fast? Of course you do! All of scrapli is built with speed in mind, but if you really   feel the need for speed, check out the `ssh2` transport plugin to take it to the next level!- __Great Developer Experience__: scrapli has great editor support thanks to being fully typed; that plus thorough   docs make developing with scrapli a breeze.- __Well Tested__: Perhaps out of paranoia, but regardless of the reason, scrapli has lots of tests! Unit tests   cover the basics, regularly ran functional tests connect to virtual routers to ensure that everything works IRL! - __Pluggable__: scrapli provides a pluggable transport system -- don't like the currently available transports,   simply extend the base classes and add your own! Need additional device support? Create a simple &quot;platform&quot; in   [scrapli_community -- this repo!](https://github.com/scrapli/scrapli_community) to easily add new device support!- __Concurrency on Easy Mode__: [Nornir's](https://github.com/nornir-automation/nornir)   [scrapli plugin](https://github.com/scrapli/nornir_scrapli) gives you all the normal benefits of scrapli __plus__   all the great features of Nornir.## RequirementsMacOS or \*nix&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, Python 3.7+&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Although many parts of scrapli *do* run on Windows, Windows is not officially supported## Installation```pip install scrapli-community```See the [docs](https://scrapli.github.io/scrapli_community/user_guide/installation) for other installation methods/details.## A simple Example```pythonfrom scrapli import Scraplimy_device = {    &quot;host&quot;: &quot;172.18.0.11&quot;,    &quot;auth_username&quot;: &quot;scrapli&quot;,    &quot;auth_password&quot;: &quot;scrapli&quot;,    &quot;auth_strict_key&quot;: False,    &quot;platform&quot;: &quot;ruckus_fastiron&quot;}conn = Scrapli(**my_device)conn.open()```</longdescription>
