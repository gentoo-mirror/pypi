We recommend that for eachinstallation you start by creating a fresh environment that only has Python installed and then install the `roman_datamodels`package and its dependencies into that bare environment. If using conda environments, first make sure you have a recentversion of Anaconda or Miniconda installed. If desired, you can create multiple environments to allow for switchingbetween different versions of the `roman-datamodels` package (e.g. a released version versus the current development version).In all cases, the installation is generally a 3-step process:* Create a conda environment* Activate that environment* Install the desired version of the `roman-datamodels` package into that environmentDetails are given below on how to do this for different types of installations, including tagged releases, DMS buildsused in operations, and development versions. Remember that all conda operations must be done from within a bash shell.### Installing latest releasesYou can install the latest released version via `pip`. From a bash shell:    conda create -n &lt;env_name&gt; python    conda activate &lt;env_name&gt;    pip install roman-datamodels&gt; **Note**\&gt; Alternatively, you can also use `virtualenv` to create an environment;&gt; however, this installation method is not supported by STScI if you encounter issues.You can also install a specific version (from `roman-datamodels 0.1.0` onward):    conda create -n &lt;env_name&gt; python    conda activate &lt;env_name&gt;    pip install roman-datamodels==0.5.0### Installing the development version from GithubYou can install the latest development version (not as well tested) from the Github main branch:    conda create -n &lt;env_name&gt; python    conda activate &lt;env_name&gt;    pip install git+https://github.com/spacetelescope/roman_datamodels### Installing for DevelopersIf you want to be able to work on and test the source code with the `roman-datamodels` package, the high-level procedure to dothis is to first create a conda environment using the same procedures outlined above, but then install your personalcopy of the code overtop of the original code in that environment. Again, this should be done in a separate condaenvironment from any existing environments that you may have already installed with released versions of the `roman-datamodels`package.As usual, the first two steps are to create and activate an environment:    conda create -n &lt;env_name&gt; python    conda activate &lt;env_name&gt;To install your own copy of the code into that environment, you first need to fork and clone the `roman_datamodels` repo:    cd &lt;where you want to put the repo&gt;    git clone https://github.com/spacetelescope/roman_datamodels    cd roman_datamodels&gt; **Note**\&gt; Installing via `setup.py` (`python setup.py install`, `python setup.py develop`, etc.) is deprecated and does not work.Install from your local checked-out copy as an &quot;editable&quot; install:    pip install -e .If you want to run the unit or regression tests and/or build the docs, you can make sure those dependencies areinstalled too:    pip install -e &quot;.[test]&quot;    pip install -e &quot;.[docs]&quot;    pip install -e &quot;.[test,docs]&quot;Need other useful packages in your development environment?    pip install ipython pytest-xdist</longdescription>
