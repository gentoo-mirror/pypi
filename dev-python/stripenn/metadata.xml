Then what are 3C data and stripes?* **Chromatin conformation capture technique**    Basically, the chromatin conformation capture technique measures the frequency of DNA interactions. There are several sequencing techniques to see the genome-wide DNA interactions such as `Hi-C &lt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2858594/&gt;`_ , `HiChIP &lt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5501173/&gt;`_,  `PLAC-seq &lt;https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016137&gt;`_ and `micro-C &lt;https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)00638-8&gt;`_. Currently, imaging-based methods are also developed to construct the spatial distance map of DNA interaction ( `Su et al., 2020 &lt;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420309405&gt;`_ ). These data have revealed that our genome is highly organized including special features such as compartment, TAD, loops and stripes.* **Architectural stripe**    Architectural stripes are shown in the figure above (highlighted in green border). Stripe is one of the distinctive features found from 3C data. It was first predicted by `Fudenberg et al., Cell Reports, 2016 &lt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4889513/&gt;`_. As shown in the figure above, it is a linear pattern where an anchor forms interaction with contiguous genomic region. It is known that stripes are enriched with super-enhancers, and also it is a hopspot for DNA damage. To address more characteristics of stripes, we need accurate stripe caller and that's why we've developed Stripenn.Requirement############**Python 3.8 or higher version**Installation############**Linux / Mac**Open terminal and type following:::    pip install stripennIf pip is not installed, install pip first: `pip installation &lt;https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/&gt;`_When pip is not working, replace it with 'pip3'. Installation may take several minutes.**Windows**Windows users will fail to install stripenn using the above command. This is because the pypairix package installed with the cooler package does not support Windows. But we can still install stripenn on Windows! The strategy is (1) to install all dependency packages except pypairix and then (2) to install stripenn without dependency packages. To do this, type followings on command windows:::   pip install simplejson multiprocess pandas numpy matplotlib opencv-python scikit-image scipy joblib tqdm Bottleneck typer pathlib   pip install --no-deps cooler   pip install --no-deps stripennIf you have any trouble with installation, please leave it on issue board.Quick start (Example run)#########################Let's check if stripenn is working or not with a simple example which might take less than 5 minutes. This example .cool file is Smc1-HiChIP of only chr16 of mouse T lymphocyte (`Fasolino et al., Immunity, 2020 &lt;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320300303&gt;`_).::   cd &lt;Test_Directory&gt; # Move to your test directory   wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/1bb2npvrzp3by5y/BL6.DPT.chr16.mcool?dl=0 -O test.mcool --no-check-certificate   stripenn compute --cool test.mcool::resolutions/5000 --out output_dir/ -k 16 -m 0.95,0.96,0.97,0.98,0.99*Tip*: For those whose computer has not enough memory (e.g., &lt; 24GB), we provide slow version of Stripenn as follow:::   stripenn compute --cool test.mcool::resolutions/5000 --out output_dir/ -k 16 -m 0.95,0.96,0.97,0.98,0.99 -sIn this example, stripes are searched from chromosome 16 of 5kb-resolution data for short running time.**Output**::   cat output_dir/result_filtered.txtwill show a result table including 12 columns like below... csv-table:: result_filtered.txt   :header: &quot;chr&quot;, &quot;pos1&quot;,&quot;pos2&quot;,&quot;chr2&quot;,&quot;pos3&quot;,&quot;pos4&quot;,&quot;length&quot;,&quot;width&quot;,&quot;Mean&quot;,&quot;maxpixel&quot;,&quot;pvalue&quot;,&quot;Stripiness&quot;    &quot;16&quot;, &quot;23970001&quot;, &quot;24015000&quot;, &quot;16&quot;, &quot;23970001&quot;, &quot;24870000&quot;, &quot;900000&quot;, &quot;45000&quot;, &quot;2.913&quot;, &quot;98.0%&quot;, &quot;0.025&quot;, &quot;10.809&quot;    &quot;16&quot;, &quot;10550001&quot;, &quot;10595000&quot;, &quot;16&quot;, &quot;10550001&quot;, &quot;10870000&quot;, &quot;320000&quot;, &quot;45000&quot;, &quot;6.638&quot;, &quot;99.0%&quot;, &quot;0.042&quot;, &quot;10.020&quot;    &quot;16&quot;, &quot;32490001&quot;, &quot;32525000&quot;, &quot;16&quot;, &quot;32490001&quot;, &quot;32700000&quot;, &quot;210000&quot;, &quot;35000&quot;, &quot;8.117&quot;, &quot;98.0%&quot;, &quot;0.012&quot;, &quot;5.254&quot;Each line represents the coordinates and other information of a vertical stripe... image:: https://github.com/ysora/stripenn/blob/main/image/readme1.png* chr: chromosome* pos1: x1 position of stripe* pos2: x2 position of stripe* chr2: chromosome (same as chr_1)* pos3: y1 position of stripe* pos4: y2 position of stripe* length: Length of vertical stripe (y2-y1+1)* width: Width of vertical stripe (x2-x1+1)* mean: Average pixel value within stripe* maxpixel: Pixel saturation parameter.
