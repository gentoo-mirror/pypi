	<longdescription>====================================================Flask ASK SDK - Extending ASK SDK to work with Flask====================================================**flask-ask-sdk** is the extension package, that will let skill developersuse `ASK SDK &lt;https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-python/overview.html&gt;`__package in their Flask application. It provides an easy way to register anduse `skills as custom webservices &lt;https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/host-a-custom-skill-as-a-web-service.html&gt;`__.Quick Start-----------If you already have a skill built using the ASK SDK skill builders, then youonly need to do the following, to set this up in your flask app:.. code-block:: python    from flask import Flask    from ask_sdk_core.skill_builder import SkillBuilder    from flask_ask_sdk.skill_adapter import SkillAdapter    sb = SkillBuilder()    # Register all handlers, interceptors etc.    # For eg : sb.add_request_handler(LaunchRequestHandler())    app = Flask(__name__)    skill_response = SkillAdapter(        skill=sb.create(), skill_id=&lt;YOUR_SKILL_ID&gt;, app=app)    skill_response.register(app=app, route=&quot;/&quot;)    if __name__ == '__main__':        app.run()Are you planning to deploy your skill on AWS Lambda? Then, you don't evenneed this package. The `ASK SDK` provides a `lambda_handler` that can bedirectly used in your lambda console.More code examples can be found `here &lt;https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-python/sample-skills.html&gt;`__.Features--------- Works as an extension on skills built using ASK SDK. No need to learn  something new.- Provides default request signature and request timestamp verification.  These can be configured on app level by setting / unsetting app  configuration.- Provides a way to register multiple skills on your app, at different  endpoints.Installation------------.. important::    `cryptography` is a dependency for this package. If you have not    already installed    `cryptography &lt;https://cryptography.io/en/latest/&gt;`_, you might need to    install additional prerequisites as detailed in the    `cryptography installation guide &lt;https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/&gt;`_    for your operating system.Assuming that you have Python and ``virtualenv`` installed, you caninstall the package and it's dependencies (``ask-sdk-webservice-support``,``flask``) from PyPi as follows:.. code-block:: sh    $ virtualenv venv    $ . venv/bin/activate    $ pip install flask-ask-sdkThis package is **not** installed along-side `ask-sdk` standard distribution,and has to be installed separately if you need support for skilldeployment as webservice, using Flask.SDK Usage and Getting Started-----------------------------Getting started guides, SDK Features, API references, samples etc. canbe found in the `technical documentation &lt;https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-python/overview.html&gt;`_Got Feedback?-------------- We would like to hear about your bugs, feature requests, questions or  quick feedback.
