	<longdescription>The CGCloud plugin for Toil lets you setup a fully configured Toil/Mesoscluster in EC2 in just minutes, regardless of the number of nodes.Prerequisites=============The ``cgcloud-toil`` package requires that the ``cgcloud-core`` package andits prerequisites_ are present... _prerequisites: ../core#prerequisitesInstallation============Read the entire section before pasting any commands and ensure that allprerequisites are installed. It is recommended to install this plugin into the virtualenv you created for CGCloud::   source ~/cgcloud/bin/activate   pip install cgcloud-toilIf you get ``DistributionNotFound: No distributions matching the version forcgcloud-toil``, try running ``pip install --pre cgcloud-toil``.Be sure to configure_ ``cgcloud-core`` before proceeding... _configure: ../core/README.rst#configurationConfiguration=============Modify your ``.profile`` or ``.bash_profile`` by adding the following line::   export CGCLOUD_PLUGINS=&quot;cgcloud.toil:$CGCLOUD_PLUGINS&quot;Login and out (or, on OS X, start a new Terminal tab/window).Verify the installation by running::   cgcloud list-rolesThe output should include the ``toil-box`` role.Usage=====Create a single ``t2.micro`` box to serve as the template for the clusternodes::   cgcloud create -IT toil-boxThe ``I`` option stops the box once it is fully set up and takes an image (AMI)of it. The ``T`` option terminates the box after that.Substitute ``toil-latest-box`` for ``toil-box`` if you want to use the latestunstable release of Toil.Now create a cluster by booting a leader and the workers from that AMI::   cgcloud create-cluster toil -s 2 -t m3.large   This will launch a leader and two workers using the ``m3.large`` instance type.SSH into the leader::   cgcloud ssh toil-leader   ... or the first worker::   cgcloud ssh -o 0 toil-worker   ... or the second worker::   cgcloud ssh -o 1 toil-worker</longdescription>
