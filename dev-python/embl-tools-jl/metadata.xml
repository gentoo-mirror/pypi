It is recommended to put EMBL-Tools in the root of your regular work directory you use JupyterLab in. If the scan does not find the EMBL-Tools in the current Jupyter Lab working dir root, the extension will copy the supplied version for temporary use. This copy will be removed at the next startup.**## Quick InstallNote: You will need NodeJS to install the extension.```bashpip install embl_tools_jljupyter lab build```## TroubleshootIf you are seeing the frontend extension but it is not working, checkthat the server extension is enabled:```bashjupyter serverextension list```If the server extension is installed and enabled but you are not seeingthe frontend, check the frontend is installed:```bashjupyter labextension list```If it is installed, try:```bashjupyter lab cleanjupyter lab build```## Contributing### InstallThe `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.```bash# Clone the repo to your local environment# Move to embl-tools-jl directory# Install server extensionpip install -e .# Register server extensionjupyter serverextension enable --py embl_tools_jl# Install dependenciesjlpm# Build Typescript sourcejlpm build# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLabjupyter labextension link .# Rebuild Typescript source after making changesjlpm build# Rebuild JupyterLab after making any changesjupyter lab build```You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab in watch mode to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension and application.```bash# Watch the source directory in another terminal tabjlpm watch# Run jupyterlab in watch mode in one terminal tabjupyter lab --watch```### Uninstall```bashpip uninstall embl_tools_jljupyter labextension uninstall embl-tools-jl```</longdescription>
