	<longdescription># minKNOW mock serverThis code will emulate a [Oxford Nanopore Technologies](https://nanoporetech.com/) gene sequencing device (e.g. [minION](https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion) or minKNOW) using its gRPC Remote Procedure Calls [LIMS interface](https://github.com/nanoporetech/minknow_lims_interface) to interact with its embedded software. This package is designed to form part of a software development environment to facilitate rapid prototyping and automated testing.## Glossary* **minKNOW** device manager (host software)* **gridION** a physical device containing an array of sequencing devices* **minION** a physical sequencing device## See also* Developed at The University of Sheffield, IT Services, [Research &amp; Innovation](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research).* [pyminknow](https://pypi.org/project/pyminknow/) at PyPi* [pyminknow](https://hub.docker.com/r/jheffer/pyminknow) at Docker Hub* [pyminknow](https://github.com/Joe-Heffer-Shef/pyminknow) at GitHub* [pyminknow](https://figshare.shef.ac.uk/articles/code/pyminknow/12357581) at FigShare# Installation```bash$ pip install pyminknow```# UsageThe service may run in a container or in a Python environment. To see the usage reference, run:```bash$ python pyminknow --help```## Test clientYou may use `client.py` to test the functionality of the server. To get help, run:```bash$ python client.py --help```Unit tests may be used to systematically test the server functionality.```bash$ python -m unittest```## ContainerThe container is based on Debian Linux and uses Python 3.7 as defined in the `Dockerfile`. You may build and run the container using the commands below.```bash$ docker build --tag pyminknow:latest .$ docker run --name minit --publish 5901:5901 -publish 22:22 -d pyminknow:latest# Start the SSH service$ docker exec -it --user root minit service ssh start```## PythonYou should do this inside a Python 3.7 virtual environment. Install packages and then run the service. ```bash$ pip install pyminkow$ python -m pyminknow```</longdescription>
