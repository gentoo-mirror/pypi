It plays sounds when a ``--sound`` or``--play-sound`` flag is passed.The notifications and sounds are different depending whether the test runhas passed or failed.The messages and sounds are only played when the flags are passed. This allowsyou to turn it on only for those tests for which you expect a long time isneeded.Alternatives============`pytest-notifier &lt;https://github.com/ratson/pytest-notifier&gt;`_ always sendsa notification. It can be turned of with ``--notify-off``. This is afundamentally different design choice, which is why this package was created.Pytest-notifier has been around for a long time and is still being activelymaintained. It does not support playing sounds, but it does support Mac OS Xnotifications.Usage======================================== =======option                              usage=================================== =======``--notify``                        Sends a desktop notification when pytest is finished. (Only implemented on Linux. Requires the 'notify-send' program in PATH on Linux.``--sound``, ``--play-sound``       Plays a sound when pytest is finished. (Only implemented on Linux and Macintosh systems).``--disturb``                       shorthand for ``--notify --sound``=================================== =======Installation============pytest-notification can be installed with ``pip install pytest-notification``.Linux-----On Linux notifications are supported via the ``notify-send`` program. On Debian,Ubuntu and derived distros this is available in the ``libnotify-bin`` package.On Linux sound is supported via the ``paplay`` program. On Debian, Ubuntu andderived distros this available in the ``pulseaudio-utils`` pacakge.The installation for Ubuntu should be:.. code-block:: bash    sudo apt update    sudo apt install libnotify-bin pulseaudio-utils    pip install pytest-notificationMac OS X--------On Mac OS X sound is implemented via the ``afplay`` program, which should beinstalled by default. Since I do not own a mac I can not test this feature.pull requests are welcome.On Mac OS X notifications are not supported.Alternatively you could take a look at `pytest-notifier&lt;https://github.com/ratson/pytest-notifier&gt;`_, which does support Mac OS X.Windows-------Windows is not supported.Contributing============Pull requests for improved Mac and Windows support are welcome. As well as ideasand other pull requests. Simply create a new issue or PR on the `github page&lt;https://github.com/rhpvorderman/pytest-notification&gt;`_.Windows  support----------------In theory the ``winsound`` module could be used toplay sounds, but this only supports wave files. These are very big andcumbersome to distribute. I have not actively looked for a way to create amessage on windows. There will probably be some powershell command that canpull this off. Pull requests are welcome.</longdescription>
