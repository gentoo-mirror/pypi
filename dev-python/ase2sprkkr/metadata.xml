	<longdescription># ASE2SPRKKRASE2SPRKKR package provide an interface that allow use of the [SPR-KKRpackage](https://www.ebert.cup.uni-muenchen.de/index.php/en/software-en/13-sprkkr)to electronic structure calculation within [Atomic SimulationEnvironment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) (abbreviated as ASE)\-\--Python tool that integrates the various tools for electronicstructure calculation.## Usefull links-   [SPR-KKR](https://ebert.cup.uni-muenchen.de/index.php/en/software-en/13-sprkkr)-   [ASE - Atomic Simulation    Environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)-   [Online version of this    documentation](https://ase2sprkkr.github.io/ase2sprkkr/)-   [GitHub repository of the ASE2SPRKKR    package](https://github.com/ase2sprkkr/ase2sprkkr/)-   [SPR-KKR    manual](https://www.ebert.cup.uni-muenchen.de/index.php/en/repository/func-startdown/251/lang,en-gb/)## Installation of the package using package managersThe simplest way how to install and use the package is to install themusing package managers: either pip``` bashpip install ase2sprkkr```or conda``` bashconda install -c ase2sprkkr ase2sprkkr```### Further notesIn some systems, the `pip` utility for `python3` is called `pip3`. If itis not installed, you can install it using the linux distributionpackage manager, e.g. in Debian/Ubuntu``` bashapt install pip3```or``` bashzypper install pip```in OpenSUSEFor the conda installation instructions, see the Anaconda documentation&lt;https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/&gt; however, for theusers unexperienced with conda, the (simpler) pip way is recommended.## Install the packages from GIT (and/or source codes)If you do not want to use public package managers as pip or conda, oryou want to contribute to development, you can use GIT to obtain thepackage sources.### Requirements-   Python \&gt;= 3.7-   SPR-KKR (not checked by the installer)-   Python packages: ase, mendeleev, spglib, pyparsing-   Git (to obtain the sources)### Obtaining the package using GIT``` bashgit clone https://github.com/ase2sprkkr/ase2sprkkr.gitgit checkout release```The first line fetches the code of the package. The second one checksout the recommended production version of the code.If you want to obtain the current version of the (earlier-downloaded)code, run``` bashgit fetchgit checkout release```Alternatively, you can checkout `master` or `develop` branch``` bashgit checkout master```to obtain a newer (not thorougly tested yet) version or``` bashgit checkout develop```to obtain the bleeding edge version (feel free to try it, test it andreport the bugs).### Using the package (without installing the pip/conda packages)You can either just add the src directory to your PYTHONPATH, or you canbuild and install the package, as it is described below.### Installation of the package from the sourcesTo install the package, the simplest way is to use pip``` bashpython3 -m pip install .```Maybe, you will have to replace `python3` with `python`. For an editableinstall, please run``` bashpython3 setup.py develop --user```and ignore some deprecation warning. Editable install is aimed fordevelopers: in this type of install, only link to the current directorywill be added to your local `site-packages`, which allows you to use thechangesyou make to the source code.## Documentation of the packageThe documentation is published online at&lt;https://ase2sprkkr.github.io/ase2sprkkr/&gt;If you are using Git cloned sources, you can run    open docs/index.htmlto see the (offline version of the) documentation. The documentationcontains parts, that are generated from the docstrings in the sourcecode. You can regenerate these by``` bashmake docs```Sphinx and sphinx-toolbox python packages (installable e.g. using pip)and pandoc (for generating README.md) are needed for the build.However, the official build of Sphinx miss some attributes when it isused to build the documentation. So, till the pullrequest that correctsthe Sphinx behavior will be merged into Sphinx, please use the followingfork for building the documentation.&lt;https://github.com/lokik/sphinx.git&gt;## How to contribute or to report a bugPlease feel free to make a pull-request or post an issue at:&lt;https://github.com/ase2sprkkr/ase2sprkkr&gt;</longdescription>
