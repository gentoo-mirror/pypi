	<longdescription># GameDetectorDetect games, get Steam info, profit. This program allows you to select a folder on your system (probably in your game library), that contains a game. It looks in the game folder for files that can identify what game it is, get a Steam `AppId` for said game, and find a reasonable list of `EXE` files that could possibly be the game executable.The purpose of this application is so that it can be used in a much larger application, an automatic game manager for data hoarders. I'll let you know more about this as I develop it, but believe me, it'll be super rad.## Disclaimer- Does not circumvent DRM- Does not encourage the use of pirated software- Uses publicly available APIs provided by Steam or others- Makes a reasonable attempt to respect ratelimits- Caches responses to save bandwidth and API load- Does not download or upload game data to any server## Features- Very fast (reading from compressed archives is limited by 7-zip)- Folder support- 7-zip archive support- GOG game support- Steam game support- DRM-free games support## CompatibilityCurrently, only Windows 10/11 are officially supported, but Debian/Linux support is planned in the future.The project uses `pathlib` so handling different paths should be trivial, its just not tested.The only known dependency issue is `pywin32`, and there's already a stub for the single function using it for Linux systems to continue using the library.## InstallingInstall [Python 3.10+](https://python.org/downloads)Clone the repository and install dependency manager (`pipenv`)```shgit clone https://github.com/Aareon/GameDetectorcd GameDetectorpy -m pip install pipenvpipenv install```After installing dependencies, and given that their were no errors in doing so, run the application.```shcd GameDetectorpy ./gamedetector/game_detect.py```## What to expect after running directlyAfter executing the program, you will be prompted to select a folder (game folder). The program will then attempt to detect what game it is based on things like folder name, as well as checking known files that are commonly available in many distributions of games. It will tell you the name of the game detected, the version, the Steam AppId (if available on Steam), as well as a game description.This program isn't super useful to regular users, but it will be extremely handy to have as a library for other applications.## Usage as a library```pyfrom pathlib import Pathfrom gamedetector.game_detect import detect_folder, detect_7z, NonSteamGame, SteamGame, NoGameException, SteamApiExceptiongame_path = detect_folder(Path(&quot;some path to a game&quot;))  # will return either NonSteamGame, or SteamGame if AppId is foundgame_7z_path = detect_7z(Path(&quot;path to 7z file containing game&quot;))  # will return same as above```## Reporting bugsPlease see [the Issues page](https://github.com/Aareon/GameDetector/issues). Please include the full output from the program.## LicenseMIT (free as in free beer, free to redistribute with credit, free to use commercially with credit)</longdescription>
