	<longdescription>=========================================================ElephantBlog - An extensible Blog Module based on FeinCMS=========================================================Every Django Developer has written its own Django-based blog. But most of them have a lotof features, that you'll never use and never wanted to, or they are just too simple for yourneeds, so you'll be quicker writing your own.Following the principles of FeinCMS, ElephantBlog tries to offer simple and basic blogfunctionality, but remains extensible so that you just pick what you need. And ifyou don't find an extension, you can quickly write your own and use it withElephantBlog.How it works============Basically, ElephantBlog just uses what FeinCMS already has in a blog way. A blog way means:Multiple entries in a timeline. One blogentry is similar to a FeinCMS page: It can havemultiple content types and some meta informations like title, slug, publishing date, ...If you need more, like comments, tagging, categories, translations, you name it,then you can use the bundled extensions or write your own. (and please don't forgetto publish your extensions back to the community).And obviously, ElephantBlog can also be integrated as application content in your existingFeinCMS site. But if you want to run a blog only, then you don't have to activate FeinCMSpage module.Features========The biggest feature may be that there are only a few features:* Pretty URLs* Feed creation* Time-based publishing* Based on FeinCMS item editor with the ability to integrate all of those FeinCMS  content typesBundled extensions------------------You can, if you want, activate those extensions:* Disqus comments* Categories* Multilingual support* ... (more to come, you name it!)Getting started===============If you are not familiar with FeinCMS then you probably want to learn more about FeinCMS:http://feincms.orgRead the docs: http://feincms-elephantblog.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Read the source: https://github.com/feincms/feincms-elephantblog.. image:: https://pypip.in/wheel/feincms-elephantblog/badge.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/feincms-elephantblog/    :alt: Wheel StatusChangelog=========- 1.1: Support for Django 1.8 and FeinCMS 1.11 to Django 1.10 and       FeinCMS 1.13 (not all combinations).- 1.0.2: Support for Django 1.8 and FeinCMS 1.11         Experimental support for FeinCMS 2- 1.0.1: Support for Django 1.7- 1.0.0: First official release</longdescription>
