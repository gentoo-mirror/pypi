	<longdescription># sphinxext-photofinishPhotofinish is a sphinx extension for creating [responsive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) images to your Sphinx site. This has several benefits:- Lower bandwidth cost for browsers and devices that don't need the higher resolution version- Higher resolution images for higher resolution devicesPhotofinish can dramatically increase the loading time of your Sphinx website.## Installation`python -m pip install sphinxext-photofinish`## UsageJust add `sphinxext-photofinish` to your extensions list in your `conf.py````pythonextensions = [    &quot;sphinxext.photofinish&quot;,]```## ConfigurationPhotofinish adds several `conf.py` options that you can optionally configure:`max_viewport_width` - This is maximum &quot;viewable&quot; size of images in your documentation. Typically, it's set to the width of your body. Responsive images are generated up to double of this value. Default is 1000.`width_min` - Minimum width of images to generate. Default is 500.`width_step` - The resolution to iterate over for generating images. EX: 500, 800, 1100. Default is 300.`photofinish_ci_only` - Should this extension only run if the `CI` environment variable is set? Default is False.</longdescription>
