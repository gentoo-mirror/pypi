	<longdescription># sts-libsPython library for simplifying the process of writing storage tests on RPM-based Linux distributions.## Aboutsts-libs is designed to work with [tmt](https://github.com/teemtee/tmt) and pytest.It started as an incompatible fork of [libsan](https://gitlab.com/rh-kernel-stqe/python-libsan)and [stqe](https://gitlab.com/rh-kernel-stqe/python-libsan) with many changes. Most notably: - Python 3.8+ only. - Minimum dependencies. - With tmt and pytest compatibility in mind. - One repository for both libs and tests.Going forward, the libs could become a pytest plugin and compliment others, like pytest-testinfra, with which there is currently some overlap.## Who is this for?Fedora, CentOS Stream, RHEL testers.## How do I contribute?See [contributing](https://gitlab.com/rh-kernel-stqe/sts/docs/contributing.md) doc.</longdescription>
