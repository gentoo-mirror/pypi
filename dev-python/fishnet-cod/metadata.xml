	<longdescription># FishnetFishnet stands for **Financial time Series Hosting NETwork**.It is a Compute-over-Data (CoD) system that uses the distributed Aleph.im network as a substrate for computation.It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer, and serverless system that allows users to run statistical computations on theirtimeseries data without having to upload it to a centralized server.This python module contains a common data model, built on the[Aleph Active Record SDK (AARS)](https://github.com/aleph-im/active-record-sdk), that is being used by the Fishnet APIand executor VMs. The data model is used to store and query:- Timeseries &amp; Datasets- Algorithms- Permissions- Executions- ResultsAlso contains the executor code for the Fishnet Executor VM. Right now it supports Pandas, but in the future it willsupport other execution environments (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow).## Roadmap- [x] Basic message model- [x] API for communicating with Fishnet system  - [x] Basic CRUD operations  - [x] Permission management  - [ ] Timeslice distribution across executor nodes  - [ ] Signature verification of requests  - [ ] Local VM caching- [x] Executor VM  - [x] Listens for Aleph &quot;Execution&quot; messages and executes them  - [x] Uploads results to Aleph  - [x] Pandas support  - [ ] Distributed execution &amp; aggregation  - [ ] Different execution environments (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow)  - [ ] GPU support</longdescription>
