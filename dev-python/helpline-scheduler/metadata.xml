	<longdescription># Workshift scheduler for a helplineCode written in Python finds the best possible schedule for volunteers while incorporating constrains and special requirements using **[CP-SAT Solver](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver)** (Constraint Programming - boolean SATisfiability problem Solver).Java version is in development.### The problemArranging volunteers for a helpline service for the period of one month.There are three types of work that could be done on the same day:- Phone shift: Every day.- Chat shift: Mondays and Wednesdays.- Observer shift: Any day.### Constraints:Properties of each volunteer:- Available days.- Function: doing phone, chat, both or observation for training purposes.- Maximum amount of weekend shifts.- Whether their shifts have to be on separate weeks.- Whether they welcome observers.- Whether they want to work alone.- Whether they cannot yet work alone.- List of people they do not want to work with.Each volunteer has to have 4 days between their shifts.### Priorities:1. Have minimum one volunteer for each day.2. Fill chat shifts.3. Have a second volunteer even on phone days.4. Employ observers on days when there is only phone shift.### Objective: Maximize filled shifts.&lt;hr&gt;## InstallationRequires 64-bit Python 3.7&lt;code&gt;pip3 install helpline-scheduler&lt;/code&gt;## Usage1. Select your language in config.py: EN/HU/CN   Alternatively you can create your XX language extension by creating the corresponding data_XX.csv and language_XX.py files.2. Export corresponding data/data_XX.csv file into a spreadsheet, fill in your data, then export back into this file.3. Execute the program from its directory:&lt;code&gt;python3 schedule.py&lt;/code&gt;## Output1. Prints results into the terminal and saves it into schedule_YYYY_MM____YYYYMMDD_hhmm.txt.2. Saves results into schedule_YYYY_MM____YYYYMMDD_hhmm.csv which can be conveniently imported into a spreadsheet.</longdescription>
