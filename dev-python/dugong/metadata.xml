	<longdescription>========================== The Python Dugong Module==========================.. default-role:: code.. start-introThe Python Dugong module provides an API for communicating with HTTP1.1 servers. It is an alternative to the standard library's`http.client` (formerly *httplib*) module. In contrast to`http.client`, Dugong:- allows you to send multiple requests right after each other without  having to read the responses first.- supports waiting for 100-continue before sending the request body.- raises an exception instead of silently delivering partial data if the  connection is closed before all data has been received.- raises one specific exception (`ConnectionClosed`) if the connection  has been closed (while `http.client` connection may raise any of  `BrokenPipeError`, `~http.client.BadStatusLine`,  `ConnectionAbortedError`, `ConnectionResetError`,  `~http.client.IncompleteRead` or simply return ``''`` on read)- supports non-blocking, asynchronous operation and is compatible with  the asyncio_ module.- can in most cases distinguish between an unavailable DNS server and  an unresolvable hostname.- is not compatible with old HTTP 0.9 or 1.0 servers.All request and response headers are represented as `str`, but must beencodable in latin1. Request and response body must be `bytes-likeobjects`_ or binary streams.Dugong requires Python 3.3 or newer... _`bytes-like objects`: http://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object.. _asyncio: http://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio.htmlInstallation============As usual: download the tarball from PyPi_, extract it, and run ::  # python3 setup.py install [--user]To run the self-tests, install `py.test`_ with the `pytest-catchlog`_plugin and run ::  # python3 -m pytest test/.. _PyPi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dugong/#downloads.. _py.test: http://www.pytest.org/.. _pytest-catchlog: https://github.com/eisensheng/pytest-catchlogGetting Help============The documentation can be `read online`__ and is also included in the*doc/html* directory of the dugong tarball.Please report any bugs on the `issue tracker`_. For discussion andquestions, please subscribe to the `dugong mailing list`_... __: http://www.rath.org/dugong-docs/.. _dugong mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/python-dugong.. _`issue tracker`: https://github.com/python-dugong/python-dugong/issuesDevelopment Status==================The Dugong API is not yet stable and may change from one release tothe other. Starting with version 3.5, Dugong uses semanticversioning. This means changes in the API will be reflected in anincrease of the major version number, i.e. the nextbackwards-incompatible version will be 4.0. Projects designed fore.g. version 3.5 of Dugong are thus recommended to declare adependency on ``dugong &gt;= 3.5, &lt; 4.0``.Contributing============The source code is available on GitHub_... _GitHub: https://github.com/python-dugong/python-dugong</longdescription>
