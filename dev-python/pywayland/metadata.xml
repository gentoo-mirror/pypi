For more help, see the `full documentation`_... _full documentation: http://pywayland.readthedocs.org/Current Release---------------PyWayland is still in a developmental state.  An current version is availableon the `cheese shop`_.  Current development versions can be obtained from the`git repository`_, feedback, as well as any bug reports or fixes are highlyappreciated... _cheese shop: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pywayland/.. _git repository: https://github.com/flacjacket/pywayland/Dependencies------------Installing PyWayland requires the Wayland library and the headers to be installed.PyWayland requires the cffi_ package to be installed.  PyWayland runs and istested against Python 3.6+, including sufficient versions of PyPy3 (see`Running Tests`_).See the `installation guide`_ for more information on installing required dependencies.. _cffi: https://cffi.readthedocs.org/.. _installation guide: http://pywayland.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#installationInstalling----------Installation can be done through pip to pull the most recently tagged release.To see instructions on running from source, see the relevant documentation on`installing from source`_... _installing from source: http://pywayland.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#installing-from-sourceBuilding Wayland protocols--------------------------In order to run from source, you will need to generate the interfaces to theWayland protocol objects as defined in the wayland.xml file.  By default, thisfile will be located in ``/usr/share/wayland/wayland.xml``.  In this case, theprotocol files can be generated by the scanner module::    $ python -m pywayland.scannerSee the help for this module to use non-default locations for the input andoutput of the scanner.The scanner is installed as a script ``pywayland-scanner`` when PyWayland isinstalled.  See ``pywayland-scanner -h`` for more information.Running Tests-------------PyWayland implements a (currently limited) test-suite in ``./tests``.  Thetests can be run through ``pytest``.  Be sure you build the protocol files (see`Building Wayland protocols`_) before running the tests... |ci| image:: https://github.com/flacjacket/pywayland/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg    :target: https://github.com/flacjacket/pywayland/actions    :alt: Build Status.. |coveralls| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/flacjacket/pywayland/badge.svg    :target: https://coveralls.io/r/flacjacket/pywayland    :alt: Build Coverage.. |docs| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/pywayland/badge/?version=latest    :target: https://pywayland.readthedocs.io/en/latest/    :alt: Documentation Status</longdescription>
