	<longdescription>The GDAPS library allows Django to make real &quot;pluggable&quot; apps.A standard Django &quot;app&quot; is *reusable* (if done correctly), but is not *pluggable*,like being distributed and &quot;plugged&quot; into a Django main application without modifications. GDAPS is filling this gap.The reason you want to use GDAPS is: **you want to create an application that should be extended via plugins**. GDAPS consists of a few bells and twistles where Django lacks &quot;automagic&quot;:* Apps are automatically found using setuptools' entry points* Apps can provide their own URLs (they are included and merged into urlpatterns automatically)* Apps can define ``Interfaces``, that other GDAPS apps then can implement* Apps can provide template hooks that can be filled with plugins' content## Limitations* GDAPS interfaces cannot inherit classes that import models (like `PermissionRequiredMixin`), as the declaration is too early in the Django setup process, and apps aren't loaded at that time.## ContributeYou can support me in various ways.* Test the code and write bug reports.* Write code* Suggest ideas (as bug report)* Support this work financially.
