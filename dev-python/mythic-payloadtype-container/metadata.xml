	<longdescription># Mythic Payload Type ContainerThe `mythic_payloadtype_container` package creates an easy way to get everything set up in a new PayloadType container for a Mythic supported Payload Type. Mythic is a Command and Control (C2) framework for Red Teaming. The code is on GitHub (https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic) and the Mythic project's documentation is on GitBooks (https://docs.mythic-c2.net). This code will be included in the default Mythic Payload Type containers, but is available for anybody making custom containers as well.## InstallationYou can install the mythic scripting interface from PyPI:```pip install mythic-payloadtype-container```## How to useThis container reports to mythic as version 12 (PyPi version 0.1.18). Use it with Mythic version 2.3.0.For the main execution of the heartbeat and service functionality, simply import and start the service:```from mythic_payloadtype_container import mythic_servicemythic_service.start_service_and_heartbeat()```You can also set `MYTHIC_ENVIRONMENT=Testing` environment variable (directly for your container/host or via Mythic/.env) to get detailed debugging information.You can get the Mythic version of this package with the `get_version_info` function:```from mythic_payloadtype_container import get_version_infoget_version_info()```## Where is the code?The code for this PyPi package can be found at https://github.com/MythicMeta/Mythic_PayloadType_Container </longdescription>
