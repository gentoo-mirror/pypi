	<longdescription># DatagetDataget is an easy to use, framework-agnostic, dataset library that gives you quick access to a collection of Machine Learning datasets through a simple API.Main features:* **Minimal**: Downloads entire datasets with just 1 line of code.* **Framework Agnostic**: Loads data as `numpy` arrays or `pandas` dataframes which can be easily used with the majority of Machine Learning frameworks.* **Transparent**: By default stores the data in your current project so you can easily inspect it.* **Memory Efficient**: When a dataset doesn't fit in memory it will return metadata instead so you can iteratively load it.* **Integrates with Kaggle**: Supports loading datasets directly from Kaggle in a variety of formats.Checkout the [documentation](https://cgarciae.github.io/dataget/) for the list of available datasets.## Getting StartedIn dataget you just have to do two things:* Instantiate a `Dataset` from our collection.* Call the `get` method to download the data to disk and load it into memory.Both are usually done in one line:```pythonimport datagetX_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = dataget.image.mnist().get()```This example downloads the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset to `./data/image_mnist` and loads it as `numpy` arrays.### Kaggle SupportKaggle [promotes](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/datasets#supported-file-types) the use of `csv` files and `dataget` loves it! With dataget you can quickly download any dataset from the platform and have immediate access to the data:```pythonimport datagetdf_train, df_test = dataget.kaggle(dataset=&quot;cristiangarcia/pointcloudmnist2d&quot;).get(    files=[&quot;train.csv&quot;, &quot;test.csv&quot;])```To start using Kaggle datasets just make sure you have properly installed and configured the [Kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api). In the future we want to expand Kaggle support in the following ways:* Be able to load any file that `numpy` or `pandas` can read.* Have generic support for other types of datasets like images, audio, video, etc.     * e.g `dataget.data.kaggle(..., type=&quot;image&quot;).get(...)`## Installation```bashpip install dataget```## ContributingAdding a new dataset is easy! Read our guide on [Creating a Dataset](https://cgarciae.github.io/dataget/dataset/) if you are interested in contributing a dataset.## LicenseMIT License</longdescription>
