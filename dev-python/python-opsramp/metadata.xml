The OpsRamp API documentation issomewhat opaque and this binding hides some of the details for exactly that reason.I have also added &quot;assert&quot; statements in various places to guard against pitfallsthat I ran into that are not obvious from the API docs.### BuildThis repo includes standard Python packaging using pyproject.toml and setuptools.Source and wheel distributions can be built using `python3 -m build` in the usual way.### ScopeThe basic framework of this library is in place and thescope has increased incrementally over time. The supplied samplesexercise most of the main API sections and are describedlater in this document.Note however that all of our wrapper objects also provide an `api` property thatcan be used to access REST URLs further down the API treewhere we have not written a specific wrapper class yet.While you can use these api objects to work directly with OpsRamp at a REST level,please consider taking the small amount of time needed to add a proper wrapper classhere instead, for your own benefit and that of future users.### Return valuesAll functions in this binding return regular Python objects (not JSON strings).In general you will need to look at the OpsRamp API docs to see exactly whatsort of object and/fields the response will contain; typically we return exactlywhat the API gave us, or an equivalent Python object if it returned JSON.## Public Object TreeFollowing is a summary of the object tree currently available in this OpsRamp language binding. Seethe &quot;Samples&quot; section later in this document for an illustration of how to use them.You start by calling `opsramp.binding.connect()`which returns a single &quot;OpsRamp&quot; object to represent the entire REST API instancethat you want to access, and make a series of calls that return progressively lower level objects to accesslower level information from OpsRamp. For clarity in these end-user instructions I have omitted several Pythonclasses that are internal implementation detail in the module and not intended for direct use by external callers.Here's an illustration of a simple use of the binding. See the Samples section for more detailed ones.```import opsramp.bindingormp = opsramp.binding.connect(OPSRAMP_URL, KEY, SECRET)cfg = ormp.config()print('alert types', cfg.get_alert_types())print('timezones', cfg.get_timezones())```### Class diagramThis diagram is an overview of the public classes and their relationship to each other.The individual classes are described in detail in the following section. This diagramwas produced using [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) `apt-get install graphviz`and to edit it you need to modify thesource file classes.dot and regenerate the PNG from that.`dot -Tpng &lt; classes.dot &gt; classes.png`![OpsRamp classes](classes.png)I have used color to highlight the subset of classes that implement a &quot;create&quot; method.### Class definitionsimport opsramp.binding- def connect(url, key, secret) _returns an instance of the class Opsramp that is connected to the specified API endpoint_  This function posts a login request to the specified endpoint URL using the key and secret given. This post  returns an access token, which the function uses to construct an Opsramp object and returns that.- class Opsramp(url, token) _an object representing the complete API tree of one OpsRamp instance_  - config() -&gt; returns a GlobalConfig object that can be used to access global settings for this OpsRamp instance.  - tenant(uuid) -&gt; returns a Tenant object representing the API subtree for one specific tenant.  - metrics() -&gt; returns a MetricsApi object that can be used to access the raw metrics api of this OpsRamp instance.import opsramp.globalconfig- class GlobalConfig() _read-only access to global settings on this OpsRamp instance_  - get\_alert\_types() -&gt; returns a list of the global alert types that are defined on this OpsRamp instance.  - get\_channels() -&gt; returns a list of the &quot;channels&quot; that are defined on this OpsRamp instance.

This a raw interface to the GET portions of the OpsRamp metrics API and you should consult the OpsRamp  documentation for the syntax that is permitted in pattern.  - search(pattern) -&gt; returns metric _time series_ values matching the pattern. These patterns  can be quite complex and you should refer to the OpsRamp API documentation for the syntax.import opsramp.tenant- class Tenant(uuid) _the API subtree for one specific tenant_  - get\_alert\_script() -&gt; Returns a string containing the appropriate Python script to run on a Linux node  to install the OpsRamp agent there and connect it to this Tenant. This text contains the tenant's access keys  so think twice before printing it to the screen or logs.  - integrations() -&gt; returns an Integrations object representing all integrations on this Tenant.  - rba() -&gt; returns an Rba object representing all runbook automation information for this Tenant.  - monitoring() -&gt; returns a Monitoring object representing all monitoring information for this Tenant.  - policies() -&gt; returns a Policies object representing the device management policies on this Tenant.  - clients() -&gt;  returns a Clients object representing all OpsRamp clients on this Tenant. _Note that  this is only valid for MSP-level tenants because an OpsRamp client cannot contain other clients._  - discovery() -&gt; returns a Discovery object representing all OpsRamp Discovery profiles for this Tenant.  - credential\_sets() -&gt; returns a Credential set object representing all OpsRamp Discovery profiles for this Tenant.  - permission\_sets() -&gt; returns a PermissionSets object representing all OpsRamp RBAC permission sets for this Tenant.  - roles() -&gt; returns a Roles object representing all OpsRamp RBAC roles for this Tenant.  - escalations() -&gt; returns an Escalations object representing the Alert Escalation Policies of this Tenant.  - mgmt\_profiles() -&gt; returns a Profiles object representing the Management Profiles of this Tenant.

See the OpsRamp API docs for details  on the format of the pattern string.import opsramp.rba- class Rba() _the runbook automation subtree of one specific Tenant_  - categories() -&gt; the subtree containing the RBA categories of this Tenant- class Categories() _the subtree for the RBA categories of one specific Tenant_  - get() -&gt; Return a list of all the script categories in this Tenant RBA subtree.  - get(uuid) -&gt; returns the definition of one specific category as a Python dict.  See the OpsRamp API docs for detailed contents of these dicts.  - create(name, optional parent\_uuid) -&gt; creates a new *category* on this Tenant and  returns its uuid. Optionally takes the uuid of a pre-existing category under which to nest the new one.  - category(uuid) -&gt; returns a Category object representing the API subtree for one specific category.  - update(uuid, definition) -&gt; Updates an existing category  - delete(uuid) -&gt; Deletes an existing category- class Category() _the subtree for one RBA category_  - get() -&gt; returns a list of the scripts in this category.  - get(uuid) -&gt; returns the definition of one specific script as a Python dict.  See the OpsRamp API docs for detailed contents of these dicts.  - create(definition) -&gt; creates a new *script* in this category. &quot;definition&quot; is a Python dict  specifying details of the script to be created. The content of these structs is complex so helper  functions for creating them are provided below.  - @staticmethod mkParameter(name, description, datatype, optional=False, default=None) -&gt; helper function that returns a  Python dict describing one parameter of a proposed new script.  - @staticmethod mkScript(name, description, platforms, execution\_type, payload=None, payload\_file=None, parameters=[], script\_name=None, install\_timeout=0, registry\_path=None, registry\_value=None, process\_name=None, service\_name=None, output\_directory=None, output\_file=None) -&gt; helper function that returns  a Python dict describing a proposed new script. There are lots of optional arguments because these structs  have variable content depending on the type of script and also some are only applicable on Linux, some only on Windows.  The function contains `assert` statements to flag violations of (some of) those rules.  I may add another layer of helpers later that are more specificially targetted (like &quot;mkPythonLinuxScript&quot; for example)  and implement those by calling mkScript() internally with appropriate arguments.  - update(uuid, definition) -&gt; Updates an existing *script* in this category given the uuid of the script.The Python dict, &quot;definition&quot; is similar to the one used for create call and the helper functions used for create can be used for update too.import opsramp.msp- class Clients() _the subtree containing all clients of this MSP-level tenant_  An OpsRamp client cannot contain other clients so this is class is only useful with MSP-level tenants.  - get() -&gt; returns a list of dicts, each one containing minimal details for one client. It's worth  noting that the main ID field in the objects that get returned is called *uniqueId* and this is the  value you need to use everywhere in this binding that a client ID is required.  - get(uuid) -&gt; returns the definition of one specific client as a Python dict.  See the OpsRamp API docs for detailed contents of these dicts.  - search(self, pattern='') -&gt; returns a list of client ids matching the specified search pattern, the format of  which is described in the OpsRamp documentation.  - create(definition) -&gt; creates a new Client in this Tenant. &quot;definition&quot; is a Python dict  specifying details of the client to be created.  The content of these structs is complex so helper functions for creating them are provided below.  - update(uuid, definition) -&gt; &quot;definition&quot; is a Python dict specifying the changes to be made to this client.  The contents are described in the OpsRamp docs and helper functions for creating these dicts are provided here.  - activate(uuid) -&gt; marks the client as &quot;active&quot; in OpsRamp.  - suspend(uuid) -&gt; marks the client as &quot;suspended&quot; in OpsRamp. _This takes 10+ seconds to run._  - terminate(uuid) -&gt; terminates the client in OpsRamp. _The API docs say that this call deletes the client but in  reality it just goes onto an &quot;inactive&quot; list that is retrievable through the API and visible in the UI. OpsRamp  say that clients on the inactive list will get garbage collected eventually, but I couldn't get clarity on  how long &quot;eventually&quot; is._  - @staticmethod mkHours(day\_start=datetime.time(9, 0),                day\_end=datetime.time(17, 0),                week\_start=2, week\_end=6,                sms\_voice\_notification=False) -&gt; returns a dict that can be used to define  customer working and opening hours in OpsRamp.  - @staticmethod mkClient(name, address, time\_zone, country, hours=None) -&gt; returns a dict that can be  used to create a new client.import opsramp.devmgmt- class Policies() _the policies subtree of one specific Tenant_  - get() -&gt; returns a list of dicts, each containing a single policy definition.  - get(uuid) -&gt; returns the definition of one specific policy as a Python dict.

The contents are described in the OpsRamp docs and helper functions for creating these dicts are provided here.  - run(uuid) -&gt; sends a request to the OpsRamp server to run this policy now. _The actual run is asynchronous._  - delete(uuid) -&gt; deletes this policy from the OpsRamp server.- class Discovery() _the discovery profile subtree of one specific Tenant_  - search(pattern) -&gt; returns a list of dicts, each containing a single discovery profile.  - create(definition) -&gt; Creates a new discovery profile in this Tenant. &quot;definition&quot; is a Python dict.  - update(definition) -&gt; Updates an existing discovery profile.  - rescan(discoveryProfileId) -&gt; Causes a discovery profile to run.  - delete(discoveryProfileId) -&gt; Deletes this discovery profile.- class CredentialSets() _the Credential set subtree of one specific Tenant_  - get(credentialSetId, minimal) -&gt; Returns a Credential set definition.  - create(definition) -&gt; Creates a new Credential set in this Tenant.  - update(credentialSetId, definition) -&gt; Update an existing Credential set.  - delete(credentialSetId) -&gt; Delete a Credential set.import opsramp.integrations- class Integrations() _the integrations subtree of one specific Tenant_  - itypes() -&gt; Returns a Types object describing all the *types*  of integrations that are available to be installed on this Tenant. Each  represents a *category* like CUSTOM, AZURE, rather than specific instances  of those.  - instances() -&gt; Returns an Instances object representing all the actual  instances of integrations that are installed on this Tenant.  - _available() -&gt; A synonym for &quot;types()&quot; that I included because that's  the name of the API endpoint in OpsRamp that returns this set of data.  It took a while to figure out what the returned data means though,  so we went with the more obvious name &quot;types&quot; here instead._  - _installed() -&gt; A synonym for &quot;instances()&quot; that I included because that's  the name of the API endpoint in OpsRamp that returns this set of data.  It took a while to figure out what the returned data means though,  so we went with the more obvious name &quot;instances&quot; here instead._- class Types() _a set of integration types_  - get() -&gt; returns a list of dicts, each containing a single integration type.  - get(uuid) -&gt; returns the definition of one specific type as a Python dict.  - search(pattern) -&gt; Search for an integration type with a specific name or  other attributes.

These are supposed to beself-explanatory so I will not document them in detail here. If any of the samplesare not obvious then please submit a PR that adds comments to the appropriatesource file explaining how it works, as an aid to other users.All of the samples expect to be run as modules, like this:```ls -l samples/*.pypython3 -m samples.timezone_listpython3 -m samples.integration_listpython3 -m samples.category_listpython3 -m samples.client_list... etc ...```### OpsRamp credentialsEach of the samples depends on the existence of some environment variables to tell it which OpsRampendpoint to use and the relevant creds. You can see those at the top of timezones.pyfor example, and you must set them appropriately in your environment before running it.```export OPSRAMP_URL='https://my-org.api.try.opsramp.com'export OPSRAMP_TENANT_ID='client_1234'export OPSRAMP_KEY='whatever'export OPSRAMP_SECRET='whatever'```The tenant id, key and secret are obtained from an &quot;integration&quot; in the OpsRamp UI.You need to go to &quot;setup&quot;, &quot;integrations&quot; and look for (or create) a row containinga custom integration that uses OAUTH2. It doesn't matter what it's called, you justneed its id and creds to call the REST API.On the list of integrations, click on the integration name in the appropriate rowand a screen appears with the &quot;Tenant Id&quot;, &quot;Key&quot; and &quot;Secret&quot; fields that you need.The UI even gives sample curl commands at the bottom and you can cut the URL valueout of those if it's not obvious. It's just the bit as far as opsramp.com like theexample above.It's not obvious, but the creds you're getting here are for *the entire Tenant*(aka client) and will be the same for all integrations on that Tenant. Be carefulwith them, don't put them in logs or post them online by accident.If there isn't a suitable integration already (or you want your own) then create a newone by selecting the &quot;other&quot; tab in the Available Integrations section at the bottomof the page and then &quot;custom&quot;. Give it a name and leave the image file field blank.The name will appear in access logs but otherwise has no real meaning. Select OAUTH2as the authentication type and hit Save. This will bring you to the screen with keysand curl commands etc as described above.### examples.pyThe file `examples.py` collects together a series of examples and illustrates most ofthe major areas of the API that we cover. It uses the same environment variables asthe samples to tell it which OpsRamp tenant to examine.`python3 -m opsramp.examples`### Simple CLI prototypeI wrote a simple Python program that uses this binding to perform some simpleread-only operations on OpsRamp. Uses the same environment variables as above.```$ python3 -m opsramp.cli tenant rba categories | jq -S .[  {    &quot;id&quot;: 346,    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Day to day actions&quot;  },  {    &quot;id&quot;: 698,    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;DR procedures&quot;  }]$ python3 -m opsramp.cli tenant monitoring templates538 monitoring templates found$ python3 -m opsramp.cli tenant agent script | wc -l763$```## The API objects and direct REST callsIf we don't have a class that exposes the piece of the API that you want to use, then you can use the `ApiObject` baseclass to make REST calls to that part directly while still using the correct wrapper classes for everything else.The general approach would be to navigate to the nearest object for which we do have a wrapper and use its `api` propertyto get an instance of the `ApiObject` class that you can then use to make direct REST calls to the tree below that point.This still has an advantage over raw curl or &quot;requests&quot; calls because the enclosing object class will have set up theURLs and access tokens for you.### API object example```monitoring_api = ormp.tenant('client_9234').monitoring().apiresult = monitoring_api.get('/templates')print(result)```This uses a REST get() to retrieve the list of templates directly from OpsRamp, by starting from the api objectof a Monitoring object. The Monitoring object will have already done all the work to set up the correct tenant,credentials and other context for that call so it's still much easier than making httplib, requests or curlcalls yourself.- ApiObject() _an object representing some subtree of a REST API_  - get(suffix='', headers={}) -&gt; performs a GET to the specified REST endpoint and returns the body of the  server's reply. &quot;headers&quot; is an optional dict containing any additional HTTP headers that you want to send  with the GET.  - post(suffix='', headers={}, data=None, json=None) -&gt; performs a POST to the specified REST endpoint and  returns the body of the server's reply. &quot;headers&quot; is an optional dict containing any additional HTTP headers  that you want to send, &quot;data&quot; is the text body, or &quot;json&quot; is a Python struct to be converted to a JSON  string and sent as a body. _Specifying both &quot;data&quot; and &quot;json&quot; in the same call results in undefined behavior  and should be avoided._  - put(suffix='', headers={}, data=None, json=None) -&gt; performs a PUT to the specified REST endpoint and  returns the body of the server's reply. &quot;headers&quot; is an optional dict containing any additional HTTP headers  that you want to send, &quot;data&quot; is the text body, or &quot;json&quot; is a Python struct to be converted to a JSON  string and sent as a body. _Specifying both &quot;data&quot; and &quot;json&quot; in the same call results in undefined behavior  and should be avoided._  - delete(suffix='', headers={}) -&gt; performs a DELETE to the specified REST endpoint and returns the body of  the server's reply. &quot;headers&quot; is an optional dict containing any additional HTTP headers that you want to send.  - patch(suffix='', headers={}, data=None, json=None) -&gt; performs a PATCH to the specified REST endpoint and  returns the body of the server's reply. &quot;headers&quot; is an optional dict containing any additional HTTP headers  that you want to send, &quot;data&quot; is the text body, or &quot;json&quot; is a Python struct to be converted to a JSON  string and sent as a body. _Specifying both &quot;data&quot; and &quot;json&quot; in the same call results in undefined behavior  and should be avoided._  - _we will add other http actions if/when a specific need for them arises_</longdescription>
