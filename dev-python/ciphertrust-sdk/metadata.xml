This will only pass the authorization and return the results as described within the documentation. It can be leveraged to handle authorization and return the work for orchestration.__Creating API Authentication:__```pythonfrom ciphertrust.api import APIimport json# User based credentialsusername = &quot;username&quot;passwd = &quot;secretpassword&quot;host = &quot;thales-host01.example.com&quot;api = API(username=username,password=passwd,hostname=host,verify=&quot;/path/to/certificate.pem&quot;)response = api.get.call(url_path=&quot;vault/keys2/&quot;)print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))```__Sample Output:__```json{    &quot;skip&quot;: 0,    &quot;limit&quot;: 10,    &quot;total&quot;: 100,    &quot;resources&quot;: [      {        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;&quot;,        &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;&quot;,        &quot;account&quot;: &quot;&quot;,        &quot;application&quot;: &quot;&quot;,        &quot;devAccount&quot;: &quot;&quot;,        &quot;createdAt&quot;: &quot;&quot;,        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;&quot;,        &quot;updatedAt&quot;: &quot;&quot;,        &quot;activationDate&quot;: &quot;&quot;,        &quot;state&quot;: &quot;&quot;,        &quot;usageMask&quot;: 0,        &quot;meta&quot;: null,        &quot;objectType&quot;: &quot;&quot;,        &quot;sha1Fingerprint&quot;: &quot;&quot;,        &quot;sha256Fingerprint&quot;: &quot;&quot;,        &quot;defaultIV&quot;: &quot;&quot;,        &quot;version&quot;: 0,        &quot;algorithm&quot;: &quot;&quot;,        &quot;size&quot;: 0,        &quot;muid&quot;: &quot;&quot;      }    ]}```## Version| Version | Build | Changes || ------- | ----- | ------- || __0.0.1__ | __final__ | Test Relese; basic functionality || __1.0.1__ | __final__ | Available Release with API and Auth functionality || __1.0.2__ | __a1__ | Removed print || __1.0.2__ | __a2__ | Added metrics in calls and additional awaits to call on mutliple calls || __1.0.2__ | __final__ | See notes below || __1.0.3__ | __final__ | See notes below || __1.0.4__ | __final__ | See notes below || __1.0.5__ | __final__ | Fixed bug passing directory param in downloads call || __1.0.6__ | __final__ | HOTFIX with generic call |### Known Bugs/Futue Features__TODO:__* &amp;#9745; Create a metrics fucntion to return* &amp;#9745; Delete all private aand passwords being printed* &amp;#9744; Add logging or streaming or none* &amp;#9744; Add own metrics  * &amp;#9744; Generic metrics wrapper  * &amp;#9744; Logging metrics wrapper* &amp;#9745; Create an average, mean, total time depending on calls being made for when you want to do a full list of keys* &amp;#9745; Missing delete https action* &amp;#9745; Create a download method to handle downlaoding files#### Release Notes#### v1.0.6* __HOTFIX__ Issue with sandard get call passes invalid arg to response.__TODO:__* Need to build additional async requests when calling multiple items.* Build out ability to send multiple requests and hold the type of requests to make it easier to use the SDK.#### v1.0.5* Bug fixed with passing &quot;save_dir&quot; into get call for downloading log files.#### v1.0.4* Updated standard download log file to include hostname in filename.#### v1.0.3* Fixed bug with headers returning a requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError due to the way headers are formated.* Added more timeing metrics for quanitfying calls.* Added ability to request a download when stream=True is passed in call.#### v1.0.2* Added Generic Metrics to each call with additional statistics that can be used.* Added async to handle multle requests; still need to take advantage of it.* Removed disclosure of secrets in debug prints.__Known Bugs:__* Too many calls cause crash or non-responsive requests leading to time out.#### v1.0.1Initial usable release* Allows ability to run get functions in a wrapper.* Supply all changes and updates with the standard get request using the api.get() call.</longdescription>
