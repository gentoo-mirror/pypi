	<longdescription># Python API client for MinKNOWThis package provides a Python client to access the [MinKNOW APIs][minknow_api]. You will need acompatible version of MinKNOW already installed to make use of this project.To check for compatibility, look at the version of *MinKNOW Core*. The first two components of theMinKNOW Core version should match the first two components of the `minknow_api` version. Forexample, `minknow_api` 5.4.0 is compatible with any 5.4.x version of MinKNOW Core (which is part ofthe 22.12 release of MinKNOW).See the [main README in the git repository][readme] for more information about the MinKNOW API.[minknow_api]: https://github.com/nanoporetech/minknow_api[readme]: https://github.com/nanoporetech/minknow_api/blob/master/README.md## UsingThe recommended way to get it is from PyPI using pip, but it can also be built from source (see`BUILD.md` in the top level of the git repository).```bash# Install minknow_api&gt; pip install minknow_api# Verify API is installed correctly:&gt; python -m minknow_api.examples.list_sequencing_positions --host localhost# Possible output if running MinKNOW locally:#   Available sequencing positions on localhost:9502:#   MN12345: running#     secure: 8000```The package contains plenty of documentation in its docstrings, although for an overview of theMinKNOW APIs themselves you may prefer to read the [API description files][api_files] - see belowfor further discussion of these files. There are also [examples][examples] in the`minknow_api.examples` submodule that show how to perform some common tasks.[api_files]: https://github.com/nanoporetech/minknow_api/tree/master/proto/minknow_api[examples]: https://github.com/nanoporetech/minknow_api/tree/master/python/minknow_api/examples## Licence and CopyrightÂ© 2023 Oxford Nanopore Technologies PLC.API Specifications for MinKNOW is distributed under the Terms and Conditions of the NanoporeCommunity.## Troubleshooting### Bad metadata keyIf you see the following error when connecting to the **local** machine:```grpc._channel._InactiveRpcError: &lt;_InactiveRpcError of RPC that terminated with:        status = StatusCode.UNAUTHENTICATED        details = &quot;Bad metadata key&quot;```you can try setting the `MINKNOW_API_USE_LOCAL_TOKEN` environment variable to `1`. Note that youwill need to have MinKNOW's local guest mode enabled for this to work (it is enabled by default, butthe setting can be changed via Mooneye).### Invalid local auth tokenIf you see the following error when connecting to a **remote** machine:```grpc._channel._InactiveRpcError: &lt;_InactiveRpcError of RPC that terminated with:        status = StatusCode.UNAUTHENTICATED        details = &quot;Invalid local auth token&quot;```you can try setting the `MINKNOW_API_USE_LOCAL_TOKEN` environment variable to `0`.### MissingMinknowSSlCertErrorIf you get a `MissingMinknowSSlCertError` exception, try setting the `MINKNOW_TRUSTED_CA`environment variable. This should be the path to the `conf/rpc-certs/ca.crt` file found in a MinKNOWinstallation. You should use a copy of the file from the same version of MinKNOW as the one you areattempting to connect to.</longdescription>
