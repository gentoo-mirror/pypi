This version has been upgraded to support python3.xQuickstart----------Feeling impatient? I like your style.In your setup.py file.. code-block:: python    setup(        ...        setup_requires = ['pyversion'],        auto_version = True,        ...    )On the command line.. code-block:: python    python setup.py increment tag register sdist uploadPBR---If you are also using the openstack PBR package pyversion supports this as welljust modify your setup.py file.. code-block:: python    setup(        setup_requires = [            'pbr',            'pyversion'        ],        pbr = True,        auto_version = &quot;PBR&quot;,    )Installation------------Download and install using `pip install pyversion`CLI---The package also comes with a cli command that can be used to determine whatthe current version the package sees for your packageusage:.. code-block:: bash    &gt;&gt;&gt; pyversion &lt;name of your package&gt;    1.2.3Developing----------To develop on this project, please take a fork of then and submit a pull requeest once changes are ready.This package makes of of pipenv for installing and dependency maintainence.If publishing to pypi, rememeber to update requirements.txt and test-requirements.txt as follows:     pipenv install --dev -ignore-pipfile &gt; requirements.txt     pipenv lock --requirements &gt; requirements.txtAlso remember to run tox in the base directory to run black, linter and other tests.You can also run `tox` to perform black formatting, linting and testing. To test build and upload to test.pypi.org use:`tox -e testrelease`To build and upload to production use:`tox -e release` will release to pypi a new version Travis is in use for CI, so you can also run: `travis-lint .travis.yml`Or use the below to manully upload:`python setup.py sdist bdist_wheeltwine upload dist/*`</longdescription>
