The branch you are on(e.g. dev, staging, prod) determines what environment/k8 namespace you deploy into.See the ./deploy.sh for details. The script will determine the branch and deploy properly. If you are on the dev branch and pass &quot;build&quot; as an argument,(e.g. `./deploy.sh build`) then the docker image used on the container is built and pushed to the gcloud image repository (gcr.io). You need to be sure to bumpthe version number in src/otter_service_stdalone/__init__.py before a new build.## VersionA git tag with the version is pushed to git whenever the version is bumped anddeployed in production. `git tag` will show you the format of the tag(e.g. 0.0.30)</longdescription>
