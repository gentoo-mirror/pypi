Most obviously used to teach computer science, it can be auseful tool for any topic that a simulation can be helpful.## A Game EngineAt its core, `ppb` provides a number of features that make it perfectfor video games. The `GameEngine` itself provides a pluggable subsystemarchitecture where adding new features is as simple as subclassing andextending `System`. Additionally, it contains a state stack of `Scenes`simple containers that let you organize game scenes and UI screens in asimple way.The entire system uses an event system which is as extensible as therest of the system. Register new values to existing event types, andeven overwrite the defaults. Adding a new event type to the system is assimple as firing an instance of your new event class with `signal`.Instead of a publisher system, the engine knows everything in its own scopeand only calls objects with appropriate callbacks. The most basic event is`Update` and your handlers should match the signature`on_update(self, update_event, signal)`.## Guiding PrinciplesBecause `ppb` started to be a game framework great for learning with,the project has a few longterm goals:### Education FriendlyNon-technical educators should feel comfortable after very littletraining. While some programming knowledge is required, the ability tothink in objects and responses to events allows educators to only focuson their lessons.### Idiomatic PythonA project built on `ppb` should look like idiomatic Python. It alsoshould look like modern Python. As such, we often add new languagefeatures as soon as they're available, letting a new user always knowppb runs on the latest Python.### Object Oriented and Event Driven`ppb` games are built out of instances of objects. Each object only has enoughinformation to respond to the event provided, which always includes the current`Scene`. Because `ppb` doesn't have a master list of events, you canprovide new ones simply to add more granular control over your game.### Hardware Library AgnosticBecause `ppb` strongly tries to be extensible and pluggable, eachhardware extension can provide its own hooks to `ppb`, and you cannearly seamlessly switch between various Python libraries.### FunOne of the maintainers put it best:&gt; If itâ€™s not fun to use, we should redo itppb is about filing off the rough edges so that the joy of creation anddiscovery are both emphasized. A new user should be able to build theirfirst game in a few hours, and continue exploring beyond that.## Try itInstall ppb in the standard method:```bashpip install ppb````ppb` provides a `run` function that makes it simple to start singlescreen games.To make a very simple game, make a directory and add an image filecalled `ship.png` to it. Then add the following to a python file andrun it.```pythonimport ppbfrom ppb.features.default_sprites import TargetSpriteclass Ship(TargetSprite):    target = ppb.Vector(0, 40)def setup(scene):    scene.add(Ship(position=(0, -7)))ppb.run(setup=setup)```Depending on your operating system,you may need to install additional packages(see [installation guide](https://ppb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started.html#installing-ppb)).## Compatibility`ppb` is guaranteed compatible with Python 3.6 or later.## Get InvolvedThe fastest way to get involved is to check out the [ongoingdiscussions.](https://github.com/ppb/pursuedpybear/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adiscussion)If you're already using `ppb` feel free to report bugs, suggestenhancements, or ask for new features.If you want to contribute code, definitely read the relevant portionsof Contributing.MD</longdescription>
