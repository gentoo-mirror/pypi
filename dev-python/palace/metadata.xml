	<longdescription># palacePalace is a Python 3D audio API wrapping around [alure].To quote alure's README,&gt; It uses OpenAL for audio rendering, and provides common higher-level features&gt; such as file loading and decoding, buffer caching, background streaming,&gt; and source management for virtually unlimited sound source handles.## FeaturesIn some sense, what palace aimes to be to [OpenAL Soft] is what [ModernGL]is to OpenGL (except that all the heavy-lifting are taken are by alure):* 3D positional sound rendering* Environmental effects: reverb, atmospheric air absorption,  sound occlusion and obstruction* Binaural (HRTF) rendering* Out-of-the-box audio decoding of FLAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, Opus, WAV, AIFF, etc.* Modern Pythonic API: `snake_case`, `@property`, `with` context manager,  type annotation## Installation### PrerequisitesPalace requires Python 3.6+ for runtime and [pip] for installation.### Via PyPIPalace can be install from the [Python Package Index][PyPI] via simply    pip install palaceWheel distributions are built exclusively for GNU/Linux on amd64.If you want to help packaging for other platforms, please reach outon [our mailing list][list].### From sourceAside from the build dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`, one willadditionally need compatible Python headers, [alure], a C++14 compiler,[CMake] 2.6+ (and probably `git` for fetching the source).Palace can then be compiled and installed by running    pip install git+https://git.sr.ht/~cnx/palace## UsageOne may start with the `examples` for sample usage of palace.For further information, Python's `help` is your friend andthe API is also available for [online reference][API].## ContributingOur documentation contains [a brief guide][contrib] which may help youget started with the development.  We also think that you might find[our design principles][design] appealing as well.## License and CreditsPalace is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify itunder the terms of the [GNU Lesser General Public License][LGPLv3+]as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3of the License, or (at your option) any later version.[The full list of works bundled with palace and other credits][copying]can be found in our documentation.[alure]: https://github.com/kcat/alure[OpenAL Soft]: https://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html[ModernGL]: https://github.com/moderngl/moderngl[Cython]: https://cython.org/[pip]: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/project/palace/[CMake]: https://cmake.org/[list]: https://lists.sr.ht/~cnx/palace[API]: https://mcsinyx.gitlab.io/palace/reference/index.html[contrib]: https://mcsinyx.gitlab.io/palace/contributing.html[design]: https://mcsinyx.gitlab.io/palace/design.html[LGPLv3+]: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html[copying]: https://mcsinyx.gitlab.io/palace/copying.html</longdescription>
