To highlight, ``pygmtools`` has the following features:* *Support various solvers*, including traditional combinatorial solvers (including linear, quadratic, and multi-graph)   and novel deep learning-based solvers;* *Support various backends*, including ``numpy`` which is universally accessible, and some state-of-the-art deep   learning architectures with GPU support:   ``pytorch``, ``paddle``, ``jittor``, ``Tensorflow``; * *Deep learning friendly*, the operations are designed to best preserve the gradient during computation and batched   operations support for the best performance.  ## InstallationYou can install the stable release on PyPI:```bash$ pip install pygmtools```or get the latest version by running:```bash$ pip install -U https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/pygmtools/archive/master.zip # with --user for user install (no root)```Now the pygmtools is available with the ``numpy`` backend.The following packages are required, and shall be automatically installed by ``pip``:```Python &gt;= 3.7requests &gt;= 2.25.1scipy &gt;= 1.4.1Pillow &gt;= 7.2.0numpy &gt;= 1.18.5easydict &gt;= 1.7appdirs &gt;= 1.4.4tqdm &gt;= 4.64.1wget &gt;= 3.2```  ## Available Graph Matching SolversThis library offers user-friendly API for the following solvers:* [Two-Graph Matching Solvers](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/pygmtools.classic_solvers.html)    * Linear assignment solvers including the differentiable soft       [Sinkhorn algorithm](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/pygmtools.linear_solvers.sinkhorn.html) [1],       and the exact solver [Hungarian](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/pygmtools.linear_solvers.hungarian.html) [2].    * Soft and differentiable quadratic assignment solvers, including [spectral graph matching](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/pygmtools.classic_solvers.sm.html) [3]       and [random-walk-based graph matching](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/pygmtools.classic_solvers.rrwm.html) [4].    * Discrete (non-differentiable) quadratic assignment solver       [integer projected fixed point method](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/pygmtools.classic_solvers.ipfp.html) [5]. * [Multi-Graph Matching Solvers](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/pygmtools.multi_graph_solvers.html)    * [Composition based Affinity Optimization (CAO) solver](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/pygmtools.multi_graph_solvers.cao.html) [6]       by optimizing the affinity score, meanwhile gradually infusing the consistency.    * Multi-Graph Matching based on       [Floyd shortest path algorithm](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/pygmtools.multi_graph_solvers.mgm_floyd.html) [7].    * [Graduated-assignment based multi-graph matching solver](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/pygmtools.multi_graph_solvers.gamgm.html) [8][9]      by graduated annealing of Sinkhorn‚Äôs temperature.* [Neural Graph Matching Solvers](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/pygmtools.neural_solvers.html)    * Intra-graph and cross-graph embedding based neural graph matching solvers       [PCA-GM](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/pygmtools.neural_solvers.pca_gm.html)       and [IPCA-GM](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/pygmtools.neural_solvers.ipca_gm.html) [10]      for matching individual graphs.    * [Channel independent embedding (CIE)](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/pygmtools.neural_solvers.cie.html) [11]      based neural graph matching solver for matching individual graphs.    * [Neural graph matching solver (NGM)](https://pygmtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/pygmtools.neural_solvers.ngm.html) [12]      for the general quadratic assignment formulation.## Available BackendsThis library is designed to support multiple backends with the same set of API.
