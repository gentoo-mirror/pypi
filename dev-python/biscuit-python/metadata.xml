	<longdescription># Python bindings for biscuitThis library provides python bindings to the [biscuit_auth](https://docs.rs/biscuit-auth/latest/biscuit_auth/) rust library.As it is a pre-1.0 version, you can expect some API changes. However, most of the use cases are covered:- building a token- appending a (first-party) block to a token- parsing a token- authorizing a token- querying an authorizerNotable missing features are:- sealing tokens- third-party blocks- snapshotsThere are no blockers for these features, they just have not been properly exposed yet.## DocumentationDocumentation is available at &lt;https://python.biscuitsec.org&gt;.## Installation`biscuit-python` is published on PyPI: [biscuit-python](https://pypi.org/project/biscuit-python/):```pip install biscuit-python```## Building/TestingSet up a virtualenv and install the dev dependencies. Plenty of ways to do that... Here's one of them:```$ python -m venv .env$ source .env/bin/activate$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt```With that, you should be able to run `maturin develop` to build and install the extension. You can then `import biscuit_auth` in a Python shell to play around, or run `pytest` to run the Python tests.</longdescription>
