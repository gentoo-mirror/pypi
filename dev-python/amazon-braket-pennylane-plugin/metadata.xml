Every custom operation supports analytic differentiation.For the analog Hamiltonian simulation devices:* The devices support ``ParametrizedEvolution`` operators created via the  `PennyLane pulse programming &lt;https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/qml_pulse.html&gt;`_ module.* PennyLane observables in the measurement (Z) basis are supported* Provides translation of user-defined pulse level control to simulation and hardware implementation.. installation-start-inclusion-marker-do-not-removeInstallation============Before you begin working with the Amazon Braket PennyLane Plugin, make surethat you installed or configured the following prerequisites:* Download and install `Python 3.8 &lt;https://www.python.org/downloads/&gt;`__ or greater.  If you are using Windows, choose the option *Add Python to environment variables* before you begin the installation.* Make sure that your AWS account is onboarded to Amazon Braket, as per the instructions  `here &lt;https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-sdk-python#prerequisites&gt;`__.* Download and install `PennyLane &lt;https://pennylane.ai/install.html&gt;`__:  .. code-block:: bash      pip install pennylaneYou can then install the latest release of the PennyLane-Braket plugin as follows:.. code-block:: bash    pip install amazon-braket-pennylane-pluginYou can also install the development version from source by cloning this repository and running apip install command in the root directory of the repository:.. code-block:: bash    git clone https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python.git    cd amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python    pip install .You can check your currently installed version of ``amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin`` with ``pip show``:.. code-block:: bash    pip show amazon-braket-pennylane-pluginor alternatively from within Python:.. code-block:: python    from braket import pennylane_plugin    pennylane_plugin.__version__Tests~~~~~Make sure to install test dependencies first:.. code-block:: bash    pip install -e &quot;amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python[test]&quot;Unit tests**********Run the unit tests using:.. code-block:: bash    tox -e unit-testsTo run an individual test:.. code-block:: bash    tox -e unit-tests -- -k 'your_test'To run linters and unit tests:.. code-block:: bash    toxIntegration tests*****************To run the integration tests, set the ``AWS_PROFILE`` as explained in the amazon-braket-sdk-python`README &lt;https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-sdk-python/blob/main/README.md&gt;`__:.. code-block:: bash    export AWS_PROFILE=Your_Profile_NameRunning the integration tests creates an S3 bucket in the same account as the ``AWS_PROFILE``with the following naming convention ``amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-integ-tests-{account_id}``.Run the integration tests with:.. code-block:: bash    tox -e integ-testsTo run an individual integration test:.. code-block:: bash    tox -e integ-tests -- -k 'your_test'Documentation~~~~~~~~~~~~~To build the HTML documentation, run:.. code-block:: bash  tox -e docsThe documentation can then be found in the ``doc/build/documentation/html/`` directory... installation-end-inclusion-marker-do-not-removeContributing============We welcome contributions - simply fork the repository of this plugin, and then make a`pull request &lt;https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/&gt;`__ containing your contribution.All contributers to this plugin will be listed as authors on the releases.We also encourage bug reports, suggestions for new features and enhancements, and even links to cool projectsor applications built with the plugin... support-start-inclusion-marker-do-not-removeSupport=======- **Source Code:** https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python- **Issue Tracker:** https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin-python/issues- **General Questions:** https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/ask (add the tag amazon-braket)- **PennyLane Forum:** https://discuss.pennylane.aiIf you are having issues, please let us know by posting the issue on our Github issue tracker, orby asking a question in the forum... support-end-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove.. license-start-inclusion-marker-do-not-removeLicense=======This project is licensed under the Apache-2.0 License... license-end-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove</longdescription>
