Open the Network Tab in Developer Tools5. Type a prompt and press &quot;Generate&quot;6. Look for fetch to https://labs.openai.com/api/labs/tasks7. In the request header look for authorization then get the Bearer Token```pythonfrom dalle2 import Dalle2dalle = Dalle2(&quot;sess-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&quot;) # your bearer key```## Generate images```pythongenerations = dalle.generate(&quot;portal to another dimension, digital art&quot;)print(generations)``````✔️ Task created with ID: task-xsuhOthvBXLEjddn3ynyiiOR⌛ Waiting for task to finish......task not completed yet...task not completed yet...task not completed yet...task not completed yet🙌 Task completed![  {    'id': 'generation-sCnERSYDPP0Zu14fsdXEcKmL',    'object': 'generation',    'created': 1553332711,    'generation_type': 'ImageGeneration',    'generation': {      'image_path': 'https://openailabsprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/user-hadpVzldsfs28CwvEZYMUT/generations/generation...'    },    'task_id': 'task-nERkiKsdjVCSZ50yD69qewID',    'prompt_id': 'prompt-2CtaLQsgUbJHHDoJQy9Lul3T',    'is_public': false  },  # 3 more ... ]```## Generate images and download them```pythonfile_paths = dalle.generate_and_download(&quot;portal to another dimension, digital art&quot;)``````✔️ Task created with ID: task-xsuhOthvBXLEjddn3ynyiiOR⌛ Waiting for task to finish......task not completed yet...task not completed yet...task not completed yet...task not completed yet🙌 Task completed!✔️ Downloaded: C:\...\generation-XySidj4N8EN6Ok9ed15BZ2bs.webp✔️ Downloaded: C:\...\generation-IK3UdxDz77FA5SLKpQPIITdU.webp✔️ Downloaded: C:\...\generation-uNejKBXz1z6EQxJAT9pAZbof.webp✔️ Downloaded: C:\...\generation-Ol1wEqNprf34vNohmJz0iUiE.webp```## Generate a specific number of images```pythongenerations = dalle.generate_amount(&quot;portal to another dimension&quot;, 8) # Every generation has batch size 4 -&gt; amount % 4 == 0 works best# download imagesfile_paths = dalle.download(generations)print(file_paths)``````✔️ Task created with ID: task-lm0V4nZasgAFasd7AsStE67⌛ Waiting for task to finish......task not completed yet...task not completed yet...task not completed yet...task not completed yet🙌 Task completed!✔️ Task created with ID: task-WcetZOHt8asdvHb433gi⌛ Waiting for task to finish......task not completed yet...task not completed yet...task not completed yet...task not completed yet🙌 Task completed!```## Generate images from a masked fileDALL·E supports an &quot;inpainting&quot; API that fills-in transparent parts of an image.The website provides a tool to paint over an existing image to indicate whichparts you want to be transparent. This Python package call assumes that theimage you provide has already been processed to have transparent parts.```python# make the right half of a saved image transparentfrom PIL import Image, ImageDrawimage = Image.open('my_image.png')m, n = image.sizearea_to_keep = (0, 0, m//2, n)image_alpha = Image.new(&quot;L&quot;, image.size, 0)draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image_alpha)draw.rectangle(area_to_keep, fill=255)image_rgba = image.copy()image_rgba.putalpha(image_alpha)image_rgba = image_rgba.resize((1024, 1024)) # image must be square and 1024x1024image_rgba.save('image_with_transparent_right_half.png')# ask DALL·E to fill-in the transparent right halfgenerations = dalle.generate_from_masked_image(    &quot;portal to another dimension, digital art&quot;,    &quot;image_with_transparent_right_half.png&quot;,)``````✔️ Task created with ID: task-xsuhOthvBXLEjddn3ynyiiOR⌛ Waiting for task to finish......task not completed yet...task not completed yet...task not completed yet...task not completed yet...task not completed yet🙌 Task completed!```# Other languages[Nodejs Package](https://github.com/ezzcodeezzlife/dalle-node)</longdescription>
