	<longdescription># cardiffwaste## AboutThis is a simple package to collect upcoming waste collections for an addresses served by Cardiff Council.## Installation```pip install cardiffwaste```## Usage### Getting CollectionsGetting collections requires your Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN), the example below uses `123456789012`. If you don't know this (highly likely), you can use the `address_search` helper to look up the UPRN as decribed [below](#address-search)```pythonfrom cardiffwaste import WasteCollectionsaddress = WasteCollections(123456789012)collections = address.get_next_collections()print(collections[&quot;general&quot;][&quot;collection_date&quot;])# 2022-01-15```Five collection types are currently handled, which are `general`, `recycling`, `food`, `garden` and `hygiene`. These keys will only be present if a collection is scheduled in the next 4 weeks. For scheduled collections, each collection will have the following keys:| Attribute | Value Type | Description || --- | --- | --- || `type` | `str` | The collection type (`general`, `recycling`, `food`, or `garden`) || `collection_date` | `datetime.date` | Date of next collection || `collection_type` | `str` | `scheduled` or `rescheduled` depending on if planned has been missed || `image` | `str` | URL of a representation of the collection type |### Address SearchYou can find your UPRN using the `address_search` helper. This takes any reasonable string describing the address, such as a post code, and returns a dictionary of possible matches. The returned dictionary is of the form `{int(UPRN): str(address_description)}`The helper can be called as follows:```pythonfrom cardiffwaste import address_searchaddress_search(&quot;CF10 1AA&quot;)# returns: # {10090717081: 'Flat 1, 22 St Mary Street, Cathays, Cardiff, CF10 1AA',#  10090717082: 'Flat 2, 22 St Mary Street, Cathays, Cardiff, CF10 1AA',#  10090717083: 'Flat 3, 22 St Mary Street, Cathays, Cardiff, CF10 1AA',#  10090717084: 'Flat 4, 22 St Mary Street, Cathays, Cardiff, CF10 1AA',#  10095459274: 'Managers Flat, Cardiff Cottage, 25 St Mary Street, Cathays,  Cardiff, CF10 1AA'}address_search(&quot;mansion house&quot;)# returns:# {10003566863: 'First Floor Flat, Mansion House, Richmond Road, Roath, Cardiff, CF24 3UN',#  10003566864: 'First Floor Rear, Mansion House, Richmond Road, Roath, Cardiff, CF24 3UN',#  10003566865: 'Second Floor, Mansion House, Richmond Road, Roath, Cardiff, CF24 3UN',#  200002933742: 'Mansion Shand House, 20 Newport Road, Adamsdown, Cardiff, CF24 0DB'}```## ContributingMy current plans are to get this to what might actually be called a stable state and sort out CI.</longdescription>
