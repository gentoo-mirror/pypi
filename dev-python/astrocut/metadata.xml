It is under active development.Three main areas of functionality are included:- Solving the specific problem of creating image cutouts from sectors of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) full-frame images.- General fits file cutouts incuding from single images and sets of images with the shared WCS/pixel scale.- Cutout post-processing functionality, including centering cutouts along a path (for moving targets) and combining cutouts.Documentation is at https://astrocut.readthedocs.io.Project Status--------------.. image:: https://github.com/spacetelescope/astrocut/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master    :target: https://github.com/spacetelescope/astrocut/actions    :alt: Github actions CI status    .. image:: https://codecov.io/gh/spacetelescope/astrocut/branch/master/graph/badge.svg  :target: https://codecov.io/gh/spacetelescope/astrocut  :alt: Codecov coverage statusDeveloper Documentation-----------------------Installation^^^^^^^^^^^^.. code-block:: bash    $ git clone https://github.com/spacetelescope/astrocut.git    $ cd astrocut    $ pip install .    For active developement intall in develop mode.. code-block:: bash    $ pip install -e .    Testing^^^^^^^Testing is now run with `tox &lt;https://tox.readthedocs.io&gt;`_ (``pip install tox``).Tests can be found in ``astrocut/tests/``... code-block:: bash    $ tox -e testTests can also be run directly with pytest:.. code-block:: bash    $ pip install -e .[test]    $ pytest    Documentation^^^^^^^^^^^^^Documentation files are found in ``docs/``.We now build the documentation with `tox &lt;https://tox.readthedocs.io&gt;`_ (``pip install tox``):.. code-block:: bash    $ tox -e build_docsYou can also build the documentation with Sphinx directly using:.. code-block:: bash                    $ pip install -e .[docs]    $ cd docs    $ make html    The built docs will be in ``docs/_build/html/``, to view them go to ``file:///path/to/astrocut/repo/docs/_build/html/index.html`` in the browser of your choice.    Release Protocol^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Follow the `Astropy template release instructions &lt;https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/astropy-package-template.html&gt;`_.Contributing------------We love contributions! Astrocut is open source,built on open source, and we'd love to have you hang out in our community.**Imposter syndrome disclaimer**: We want your help. No, really.There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're notready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly goodenough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code atall, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open sourceprojects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect codeisn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it'strying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from thosemistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You canhelp out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about theproject (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contributionprocess). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project asa whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can seethe errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.Note: This disclaimer was originally written by`Adrienne Lowe &lt;https://github.com/adriennefriend&gt;`_ for a`PyCon talk &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uj746j9Heo&gt;`_, and was adapted byAstrocut based on its use in the README file for the`MetPy project &lt;https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy&gt;`_.License-------This project is Copyright (c) MAST Archive Developers and licensed underthe terms of the BSD 3-Clause license.
