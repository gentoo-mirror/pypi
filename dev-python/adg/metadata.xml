	<longdescription>ADG is a tool generating diagrams and producing their expressions for given many-body formalisms. Diagrammatic rules from the formalism are combined with graph theory objects to produce diagrams and expressions in a fast, simple and error-safe way.The only input consists in the theory and order of interest, and the N-body character of the operators of interest. The main output is a LaTeX file containing the diagrams, their associated expressions and additional informations that can be compiled by ADG if needed. Other computer-readable files may be produced as well.</longdescription>
