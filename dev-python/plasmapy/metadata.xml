https://youtu.be/E8RwQF5wcXM[Zoom]: https://zoom.us/j/91633383503?pwd=QWNkdHpWeFhrYW1vQy91ODNTVG5Ndz09[PlasmaPy] is an open source, community-developed [Python] package forplasma research and education. PlasmaPy intends to be for plasmascience what [Astropy] is for astronomy — a collection offunctionality commonly needed by plasma scientists and researchersglobally, running within and leveraging the open source scientificPython ecosystem. The goals of PlasmaPy are more thoroughly describedin [this video]. Current functionality is described in [PlasmaPy'sonline documentation]. If you would like an idea of what PlasmaPy cando, check out our [example gallery] of Jupyter notebooks. Many of ourrecent presentations are available from the [PlasmaPy Community onZenodo].Please [submit a feature request] in our [GitHub repository] if youhave an idea for new functionality. PlasmaPy is community-driven, andfeature requests really help guide the direction of softwaredevelopment. Please also [submit a bug report] if you notice anyproblems. We really appreciate it!If you are interested in contributing, please check out our[contributor guide] and [code of conduct]. There are also a number of[good first issues] in our GitHub repository. New contributors arevery welcome!## InstallationPlasmaPy requires Python 3.8 or newer. If you do not have Pythoninstalled already, here are the instructions to [download and installPython].To install PlasmaPy on macOS or Linux, open a terminal and run:```Shellpython -m pip install plasmapy```On some systems, it might be necessary to specify the Python versionnumber, for example by using `python3` or `python3.11` instead of`python`.To install PlasmaPy on Windows, open a terminal and run```Shellpy -3.11 -m pip install plasmapy```The `3.11` may be replaced by any version of Python that is supported byPlasmaPy.If you have [installed Conda], then you can also install PlasmaPy intoan activated Conda environment by running:```Shellconda install -c conda-forge plasmapy```PlasmaPy can also be installed using [Anaconda Navigator] so long as`conda-forge` is added as a channel.Check out our instructions on [installing PlasmaPy] for more details.Please check out our documentation for more information on [how toinstall PlasmaPy]. To contribute to the package or use the most recentversion, check out our instructions on [installing PlasmaPy fromsource].## EventsPlasmaPy has several [meetings] that are on our [calendar]. Events areusually held on PlasmaPy's [Zoom] room.Last-minute changes are usually announced on the [Matrix]/[Gitter]chat room. The most up-to-date information about these meetings is onthe [meetings] page of PlasmaPy's website.### Office hoursOur weekly informal [office hours] are an opportunity to chat withactive members of the PlasmaPy community about topics related toPython and plasma science. If you'd like to learn more about PlasmaPy,our office hours are one of the best places to start. As of January2023, our office hours are on Thursdays at 2 pm Eastern. Please feelfree to come by!### Community meetingsPlasmaPy's weekly [community meetings] are a place to talk about codedevelopment. If you have an idea for a new feature or would like tomake a code contribution, community meetings are a good place to goto.  As of January 2023, community meetings are on Tuesdays at 2 pmEastern.### Project meetingsPlasmaPy's weekly project meetings are a place to discuss education,outreach, and project coordination. Topics might range from creatingeducational notebooks to organizing community events. As of January2023, project meetings are held on Wednesdays at 3 pm Eastern.### Working group meetingsPlasmaPy has started several working groups, including on diagnostics,dispersion relations, and simulation. These working groups usuallymeet fortnightly, and their meeting times can be found in PlasmaPy'sevent [calendar]. If you would like to join a PlasmaPy working groupor even start a new one, please email us at [team@plasmapy.org]!### Plasma Hack WeekA [hack week] is a mix of a hackathon and a summer school. Hack weeksprovide an opportunity to learn from each other and code together. Theinaugural [Plasma Hack Week] was held virtually in the summer of 2021,and will hopefully be held annually. Please check out the [Plasma HackWeek] website for more details, and email [team@plasmapy.org] if youwould like to become an organizer.## Community### Matrix chatIf you have any questions, the quickest way to get a response is toask on our [Matrix]/[Gitter] channel. Both of these are the same chatchannel; Gitter uses a bridge to link the two.### GitHub discussionsWe're trying out [GitHub discussions] as a place to suggest ideas,bring up discussion topics, and ask questions.### Mailing listYou can subscribe to PlasmaPy's low-volume [mailing list] to receivePlasmaPy newsletters and other announcements.### Suggestion boxWe have a [suggestion box] if you would like to (optionallyanonymously) suggest a feature/topic for consideration. Thesesuggestions might be changed into GitHub issues for furtherdiscussion.## Contact informationPlease feel free to reach out to us at [team@plasmapy.org] or stop byour [office hours] with any ideas, questions, and/or puns aboutcomputational magnetohydrodynamics.## LicensePlasmaPy is permissively licensed under a [3-clause BSD license] withadded [protections against software patents].## Citing PlasmaPyAn [emerging best practice for software citation] is to cite the_specific version_ of each software package used in a research project(instead of only citing a journal article, website, or GitHubrepository). The citation should include a persistent identifier thatuniquely identifies which version of the software was used. Wetherefore ask that you cite the specific version of PlasmaPy used inyour research project. Releases of PlasmaPy are available from the[PlasmaPy community on Zenodo], along with many other PlasmaPyresources. Please check our documentation for more detailed [citationinstructions].## AcknowledgmentsEarly development on PlasmaPy was supported in part by the U.S.[Department of Energy], the [Smithsonian Institution], [NASA], and[Google Summer of Code]. Ongoing PlasmaPy development is beingsupported through a [collaborative award] from the[Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation] program ofthe U.S. [National Science Foundation].</longdescription>
