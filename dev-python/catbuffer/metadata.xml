	<longdescription># catbufferThis is the Python version of the catbuffer library. It is generated using [catbuffer-generators](https://github.com/nemtech/catbuffer-generators) from the [catbuffer](https://github.com/nemtech/catbuffer) specification. The generated code is in Python version 3.7. This library helps serialize and deserialize NEM's Catapult entities in Python applications. The library's main client is (symbol-sdk-core-python). We suggest not using this library directly.Right now only transactions and related objects are generated in sensible manner, support ffor state-related objects will be added in future.## Installation &amp; Usage### pip installThe python catbuffer package is hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/catbuffer).To install the latest release:```shpip install catbuffer```(you may need to run `pip` with root permission: `sudo pip install catbuffer`)To install a specific version or a snapshot:```shpip install catbuffer=={version}```Example:```shpip3 install catbuffer==1.0.0.20210413.152059a1```</longdescription>
