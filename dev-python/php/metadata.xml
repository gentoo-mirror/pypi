	<longdescription>python-php==========Making some of those PHP-only functions available to PythonSometimes you want to write a Python script for a project written in PHP.For the most part, this is easy, but for a few key things, PHP breaks withthe standard and does things in a its own way.  For these cases, you can usethis module to compensate.Php.http_build_query()----------------------This was ripped shamelessly from a `PHP forum`_ and ported to Python:Essentially, it's a (hopefully perfect) replica of PHP's`http_build_query()`_ that allows you to pass multi-dimensional arrays to aPHP-managed URL via POST or GET... _PHP forum: http://www.codingforums.com/showthread.php?t=72179.. _http_build_query(): http://php.net/manual/en/function.http-build-query.phpPhp.parse_ini_file()--------------------A hacked-together attempt at making an .ini file parser that's compatible withthe &quot;standards&quot; that PHP follows in its parse_ini_file() function.  Among thehandy features included are:* List notation (``varname[] = value``)* Associative array notation (``varname[key] = value``)* Removal of wrapping doublequotes (``varname = &quot;stuff&quot;`` becomes ``varname = stuff``)You can turn off the doublequote removal with ``stripquotes=False``Example.......::    from php import Php    config = Php.parse_ini_file(&quot;config.ini&quot;)    print config[&quot;sectionName&quot;][&quot;keyName&quot;]</longdescription>
