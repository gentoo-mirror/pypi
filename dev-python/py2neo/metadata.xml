A change to the year is likely to require a more significant amount of work to upgrade.Note that py2neo is developed on a rolling basis, so patches are not made to old versions.Users will instead need to install the latest release to adopt bug fixes.More----For more information, read the `handbook &lt;http://py2neo.org/&gt;`_... |test-neo43-py27| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/technige/py2neo/test-neo43-py27   :target: https://github.com/technige/py2neo/actions?query=workflow%3A&quot;test-neo43-py27&quot;   :alt: GitHub workflow status for tests against Neo4j 4.3 using py27.. |test-neo43-py35+| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/technige/py2neo/test-neo43-py35+   :target: https://github.com/technige/py2neo/actions?query=workflow%3A&quot;test-neo43-py35+&quot;   :alt: GitHub workflow status for tests against Neo4j 4.3 using py35+.. |test-neo42-py27| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/technige/py2neo/test-neo42-py27   :target: https://github.com/technige/py2neo/actions?query=workflow%3A&quot;test-neo42-py27&quot;   :alt: GitHub workflow status for tests against Neo4j 4.2 using py27.. |test-neo42-py35+| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/technige/py2neo/test-neo42-py35+   :target: https://github.com/technige/py2neo/actions?query=workflow%3A&quot;test-neo42-py35+&quot;   :alt: GitHub workflow status for tests against Neo4j 4.2 using py35+.. |test-neo41-py27| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/technige/py2neo/test-neo41-py27   :target: https://github.com/technige/py2neo/actions?query=workflow%3A&quot;test-neo41-py27&quot;   :alt: GitHub workflow status for tests against Neo4j 4.1 using py27.. |test-neo41-py35+| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/technige/py2neo/test-neo41-py35+   :target: https://github.com/technige/py2neo/actions?query=workflow%3A&quot;test-neo41-py35+&quot;   :alt: GitHub workflow status for tests against Neo4j 4.1 using py35+.. |test-neo40-py27| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/technige/py2neo/test-neo40-py27   :target: https://github.com/technige/py2neo/actions?query=workflow%3A&quot;test-neo40-py27&quot;   :alt: GitHub workflow status for tests against Neo4j 4.0 using py27.. |test-neo40-py35+| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/technige/py2neo/test-neo40-py35+   :target: https://github.com/technige/py2neo/actions?query=workflow%3A&quot;test-neo40-py35+&quot;   :alt: GitHub workflow status for tests against Neo4j 4.0 using py35+.. |test-neo35-py27| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/technige/py2neo/test-neo35-py27   :target: https://github.com/technige/py2neo/actions?query=workflow%3A&quot;test-neo35-py27&quot;   :alt: GitHub workflow status for tests against Neo4j 3.5 using py27.. |test-neo35-py35+| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/technige/py2neo/test-neo35-py35+   :target: https://github.com/technige/py2neo/actions?query=workflow%3A&quot;test-neo35-py35+&quot;   :alt: GitHub workflow status for tests against Neo4j 3.5 using py35+.. |test-neo34-py27| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/technige/py2neo/test-neo34-py27   :target: https://github.com/technige/py2neo/actions?query=workflow%3A&quot;test-neo34-py27&quot;   :alt: GitHub workflow status for tests against Neo4j 3.4 using py27.. |test-neo34-py35+| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/technige/py2neo/test-neo34-py35+   :target: https://github.com/technige/py2neo/actions?query=workflow%3A&quot;test-neo34-py35+&quot;   :alt: GitHub workflow status for tests against Neo4j 3.4 using py35+</longdescription>
