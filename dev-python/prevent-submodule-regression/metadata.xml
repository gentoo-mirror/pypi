This setting has been added to the hook configuration,        # and should only be necessary if you are running a version older than        # 0.1.3. Keeping it here for posterity, it can safely be skipped.        types: [directory]```Example failure output:![submodule example with colorized output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60583/89809067-ec04d500-daef-11ea-9d43-7e990ea21234.png)### As a standalone script```pip install prevent-submodule-regression [path…]```If you run the script with no arguments, it will automatically find all theconfigured submodules. You can also pass it a list of files to check.It will currently ignore any path that is not staged to be commit. A futureversion of the script will have an argument to override that behavior.## TODOIn no particular order:* Actual tests* Ways to override the error and allow you to commit a regression.  * Command-line  * Environment variables* Ways to override (or disable) colorization codes  * Command-line  * Environment variables* Usage information via `--help`* Actual command-line flag parsing</longdescription>
