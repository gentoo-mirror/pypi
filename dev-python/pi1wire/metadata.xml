	<longdescription>pi1wire=====pi1wire is a library for the Raspberry PI 1Wire sensor.## Quick SampleHere is a simple usecase.```pythonfrom pi1wire import Pi1Wire, Resolutionfor s in Pi1Wire().find_all_sensors():    print(f'{s.mac_address} = {s.get_temperature():.3f}')    s.change_resolution(Resolution.X0_5)    print(f'{s.mac_address} = {s.get_temperature():.3f}')```## OS Environment(For Raspbian OS) Enable 1wire in raspi-config.```$ sudo raspi-config nonint do_onewire 0```## API### Pi1WireThis is a class that looks for sensors.#### `find_all_sensors() -&gt; List[OneWire]`Get a list of OneWire instances.#### `find(mac_address: str) -&gt; OneWire`Get a OneWire instance of the specified MAC address.#### `find_all_and_change_resolution(resolution: Resolution, use_sudo: bool = True) -&gt; List[OneWire]`Change the resolution of all sensors found and get them as a list of OneWire instances.The executing user must be able to use sudo.If the executing user has root privileges and does not need sudo, set the `use_sudo` option to False.### OneWireThis class controls the sensors.#### `mac_address`The MAC address property of the sensor.#### `get_temperature() -&gt; float`Get the temperature.#### `change_resolution(resolution: Resolution, use_sudo: bool = True) -&gt; None`Change the resolution of the temperature sensor.Depending on the `Resolution` definition, change to a resolution equivalent to increments of 0.5°C, 0.25°C, 0.125°C, or 0.0625°C.The executing user must be able to use sudo.If the executing user has root privileges and does not need sudo, set the `use_sudo` option to False.### ResolutionAn enumeration that defines the resolution setting values.#### `X0_5`Resolution is set at 0.5°C.#### `X0_25`Resolution is set at 0.25°C.#### `X0_125`Resolution is set at 0.125°C.#### `X0_0625`Resolution is set at 0.0625°C.## Change Log### 0.3.0- Added function to change resolution.- Fixed so that the order of sensor detection does not change depending on the file system.### 0.2.0- Added check for PowerOnResetValue.### 0.1.0- Initial release.## LicenseMIT</longdescription>
