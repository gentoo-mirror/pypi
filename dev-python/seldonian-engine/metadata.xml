	<longdescription>[![Tests](https://github.com/seldonian-framework/Engine/actions/workflows/test-action.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/seldonian-framework/Engine/actions/workflows/test-action.yaml)[![Docs](https://github.com/seldonian-framework/Engine/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/seldonian-framework/Engine/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yaml)# EngineThis is the source code repository for a framework for creating and running [Seldonian](https://seldonian.cs.umass.edu/) algorithms. ## InstallationTo use the latest stable version:```pip install seldonian-engine```To run this code as a developer, create a virtual environment. Then install the package locally, e.g. ```python setup.py develop```or ```pip install -e .```If you want to view the parse tree graphs using the built-in tools this library provides, install [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) onto your system. The Seldonian library uses a Python API for graphviz, and the API requires that graphviz be installed system-wide. This should resolve mysterious error messages like &quot;dot&quot; not found. &quot;dot&quot; is a command line program included with graphviz for rendering the graphs from code. ## TestingTo run the unit tests, from the command line do:```pytest```This will automatically run all tests in `tests/`. To get more introspection into the tests see the [Pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/).## VersioningThe naming of versions of this software adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Pre-release versions use a major version of &quot;0&quot;, e.g. &quot;0.0.1&quot; is the very first pre-release version. </longdescription>
