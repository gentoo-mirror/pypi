	<longdescription># Tune The Model python wrapper[Tune The Model](https://tunethemodel.com) is a few-shot AutoML system.Tune The Model can do almost anything that requires understanding or generating natural language. It is able to solve tasks in 12 languages: English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, French, German, Italian, Arabic, Polish, Dutch, and Hebrew.This package provides a simple wrapper for using our api.Using `tune-the-model` package allows you to train and apply models.## DocumentationYou can find the documentation at our [Tune The Model API docs site](https://tune-the-model.github.io/tune-the-model-docs/index.html).## Just tryWe have fine-tuned several models. You can use the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/beyondml/model-one-py/blob/main/playbook.ipynb) to try them out. You can [get the token](https://tunethemodel.com) to fine tune your own model.## Getting startedFirstly fill out the [form](https://tunethemodel.com) to get a key to access the API. We will send you the key within a day.### InstallationTo install the package just use `pip install -U tune-the-model`.### Usage```pyimport tune_the_model as ttmimport pandas as pdttm.set_api_key('YOUR_API_KEY')# load datasetstdf = pd.read_csv('train.csv')vdf = pd.read_csv('test.csv')# Call one method. It will do everything for you:# create a model, save it to the file, upload datasets and put the model in the queue for training.model = ttm.tune_generator(    'filename.json',    tdf['inputs'], tdf['outputs'],    vdf['inputs'], vdf['outputs'])# wait...# a few hours# while our GPUs train your modelmodel.wait_for_training_finish()print(model.status)print(model.is_ready)# inference!the_answer = model.generate('The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything')print(the_answer)```</longdescription>
