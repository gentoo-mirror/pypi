	<longdescription>QExPy (Queenâ€™s Experimental Physics) is a Python 3 package designed to facilitate data analysis in undergraduate physics laboratories. The package contains a module to easily propagate errors in uncertainty calculations, and a module that provides an intuitive interface to plot and fit data. The package is designed to be efficient, correct, and to allow for a pedagogic introduction to error analysis. The package is extensively tested in the Jupyter Notebook environment to allow high quality reports to be generated directly from a browser.</longdescription>
