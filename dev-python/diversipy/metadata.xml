	<longdescription>Description===========diversipy is a collection of algorithms dealing with three different but relatedtopics. The first topic is super-uniform sampling of the unit hypercube.‘Super-uniform’ in this context means that the obtained point sample should bemore uniform than a random uniform sample, which is a desirable property in manyapplications. One such application is the design of computer experiments, wheretypically space-filling experimental designs are used. After creation, thesamples can be transformed from the unit hypercube to arbitrary cuboids.The task of subset selection is defined as follows: suppose you have a set ofpoints in R^n and want to select a sample of them distributed as uniformly aspossible. This may be necessary because the original set is too large to be processed entirely. The selection problem is related to clustering, with thedifference that when using clustering, you usually want to retain thestructure of the original point set.Once one has created (or obtained from somewhere) a point set, one may want toassess its properties. Therefore, diversipy contains several functions tomeasure diversity and a few related concepts. Several different indicators areoffered because they have different advantages and disadvantages (in termsof run time and what they measure).Example=======&gt;&gt;&gt; from diversipy import *&gt;&gt;&gt; design = transform_spread_out(lhd_matrix(50, 2)) # create latin hypercube design&gt;&gt;&gt; subset = psa_select(design, 10) # select subset, for whatever reason&gt;&gt;&gt; unanchored_L2_discrepancy(subset) # calculate discrepancyNote that points are stored row-wise, in accordance with numpy convention.Documentation=============The documentation is located at https://www.simonwessing.de/diversipy/doc/</longdescription>
