It supports the following features:- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management- CI/CD with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)- Pre-commit hooks with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)- Code quality with [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/), [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff), [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and [deptry](https://github.com/fpgmaas/deptry/)- Publishing to [Pypi](https://pypi.org) or [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory) by creating a new release on GitHub- Testing and coverage with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) and [codecov](https://about.codecov.io/)- Documentation with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)- Compatibility testing for multiple versions of Python with [Tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/)- Containerization with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)---&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://fpgmaas.github.io/cookiecutter-poetry/&quot;&gt;Documentation&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-poetry-example&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt; -  &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter-poetry/&quot;&gt;PyPi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;---## QuickstartOn your local machine, navigate to the directory in which you want tocreate a project directory, and run the following two commands:``` bashpip install cookiecutter-poetry ccp```Alternatively, install `cookiecutter` and directly pass the URL to thisGithub repository to the `cookiecutter` command:``` bashpip install cookiecuttercookiecutter https://github.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-poetry.git```Create a repository on GitHub, and then run the following commands, replacing `&lt;project-name&gt;`, with the name that you gave the Github repository and`&lt;github_author_handle&gt;` with your Github username.``` bashcd &lt;project_name&gt;git init -b maingit add .git commit -m &quot;Init commit&quot;git remote add origin git@github.com:&lt;github_author_handle&gt;/&lt;project_name&gt;.gitgit push -u origin main```Finally, install the environment and the pre-commit hooks with ```bash make install ```You are now ready to start development on your project! The CI/CDpipeline will be triggered when you open a pull request, merge to main,or when you create a new release.To finalize the set-up for publishing to PyPi or Artifactory, see[here](https://fpgmaas.github.io/cookiecutter-poetry/features/publishing/#set-up-for-pypi).For activating the automatic documentation with MkDocs, see[here](https://fpgmaas.github.io/cookiecutter-poetry/features/mkdocs/#enabling-the-documentation-on-github).To enable the code coverage reports, see [here](https://fpgmaas.github.io/cookiecutter-poetry/features/codecov/).## AcknowledgementsThis project is partially based on [AudreyFeldroy\'s](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy)\'s great[cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage)repository.</longdescription>
