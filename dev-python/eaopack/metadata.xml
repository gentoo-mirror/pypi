It provides an implementation of- standard assets such as contracts, transport and storages- addition of new asset types- their combination to complex portfolios using network structures- (de-) serialization to JSON- basic input &amp; output functionalityWe found that the approach is useful for modeling very different problem settings, such as decentral and renewable power generation, green power supply and PPAs and sector coupling in ad-hoc analysis, market modeling or daily operation.You can find the documentation along with several sample notebooks here:[`EAO documentation`](https://energyassetoptimization.github.io/EAO)And an extensive technical report here:[`Report`](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3842822)To install:pip install eaopack</longdescription>
