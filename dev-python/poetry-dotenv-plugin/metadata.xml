	<longdescription># Poetry Dotenv Plugin[![CI](https://github.com/mpeteuil/poetry-dotenv-plugin/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mpeteuil/poetry-dotenv-plugin/actions/workflows/build.yml)A [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) plugin that automatically loads environment variables from `.env` files into the environment before poetry commands are run.Supports Python 3.7+```sh$ cat .envMY_ENV_VAR='Hello World'$ poetry run python -c 'import os; print(os.environ.get(&quot;MY_ENV_VAR&quot;))'Hello World```This plugin depends on the [`python-dotenv` package](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) for its functionality and therefore also supports features that `python-dotenv` supports. Interpolating variables using POSIX variable expansion for example.### OriginsInitial implementation based on the event handler application plugin example in the [Poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/plugins/#event-handler).## Install```shpoetry self add poetry-dotenv-plugin```### Coming from PipenvIf you are transitioning from `pipenv` there shouldn't be much to change with regard to the `.env` loading. If you were a user of [`pipenv`'s environment variables](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/advanced/#automatic-loading-of-env) to control `.env` loading then you can use the analogous environment variables listed below.Pipenv env var | Poetry env var-------------- | ----------------------PIPENV_DOTENV_LOCATION | POETRY_DOTENV_LOCATIONPIPENV_DONT_LOAD_ENV | POETRY_DONT_LOAD_ENV### Overriding existing environment variablesBy default, this plugin will override existing environment variables. This is because this plugin was built to make onboarding for users coming from `pipenv` as seamless as possible. If you want to prevent existing environment variables from being overridden, you can set the `POETRY_DOTENV_DONT_OVERRIDE` environment variable to `true`.[^1][^1]: See [#16](https://github.com/mpeteuil/poetry-dotenv-plugin/pull/16) for background.</longdescription>
