FROZEN_IN_STATES = ('active', )        # django-fsm specifics: state, transitions, etc.    state = FSMField(default='new')    # ...```### Customization#### Tell django-fsm-freeze which field to look up for frozenessBy default, FreezableFSMModelMixin will look for the FSMField on your modeland its value to determine whether the instance is frozen or not.However, in case your model has multiple `FSMField`s,you would need to tell the Mixin which field should be used to look up,to determine the frozeness via the `FROZEN_STATE_LOOKUP_FIELD` attribute.```pythonfrom django.db import modelsfrom django_fsm import FSMFieldfrom django_fsm_freeze.models import FreezableFSMModelMixinclass MyDjangoFSMModel(FreezableFSMModelMixin):    # In this example, when object is in the 'active' state, it is immutable.    FROZEN_IN_STATES = ('active', )    # Assign this with the name of the `FSMField` if your models has multiple FSMFields.    # See example in `mytest/models.py:FakeModel2`    FROZEN_STATE_LOOKUP_FIELD = 'state'        # django-fsm specifics: state, transitions, etc.    state = FSMField(default='new')    another_state = FSMField(default='draft')    # ...```In another case, when the desired lookup state is on another model relatedvia foreign key, instead of setting `FROZEN_STATE_LOOKUP_FIELD`,it is possible to specify the (dot-separated) path to that field in`FROZEN_DELEGATE_TO`.This setting instructs the freezable model instance to evaluate the freezablestate from that remote field.```pythonclass Parent(FreezableFSMModelMixin):    state = FSMField(default='new')class Child(FreezableFSMModelMixin):    # Assign this with the path (dotted separated) to the instance you expect    # the decision for freezability to be decided on.    FROZEN_DELEGATE_TO = 'parent'    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.PROTECT)```#### Define for partial mutability In case we want to mutate certain fields when the object is frozen, we canset the `NON_FROZEN_FIELDS` to allow it.```pythonclass MyDjangoFSMModel(FreezableFSMModelMixin):    # In this example, when object is in the 'active' state, it is immutable.    FROZEN_IN_STATES = ('active', )    NON_FROZEN_FIELDS = ('a_mutable_field', )    # This field is mutable even when the object is in the frozen state.    a_mutable_field = models.BooleanField()```See configuration example in https://github.com/ming-tung/django-fsm-freeze/blob/main/mytest/models.py## UsageThe frozen check takes place when - class is prepared (configuration checking) - `object.save()` - `object.delete()`In case of trying to save/delete a frozen object, a `FreezeValidationError` will be raised.In case of misconfiguration, a `FreezeConfigurationError` will be raised.### BypassingIf you want to bypass the frozen check for some reason, you can use the contextmanager`bypass_fsm_freeze()`, with the freezable object(s) that you want to bypassthe checks on, or apply the bypass globally via `bypass_globally` argument.You can find some usage example in test `mytest/test_models.py:TestBypassFreezeCheck`.## DevelopingFor contributors or developers of the project, please see [DEVELOPING.md](docs/DEVELOPING.md)## Contributing (TODO)For anyone who is interested in contributing to this project, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).Thank you :)For further discussions or suggestions, you could also reach out to me on twitter or email.</longdescription>
