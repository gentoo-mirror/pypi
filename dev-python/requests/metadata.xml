	<longdescription># Requests**Requests** is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library.```python&gt;&gt;&gt; import requests&gt;&gt;&gt; r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=('user', 'pass'))&gt;&gt;&gt; r.status_code200&gt;&gt;&gt; r.headers['content-type']'application/json; charset=utf8'&gt;&gt;&gt; r.encoding'utf-8'&gt;&gt;&gt; r.text'{&quot;authenticated&quot;: true, ...'&gt;&gt;&gt; r.json(){'authenticated': True, ...}```Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your `PUT` &amp; `POST` data — but nowadays, just use the `json` method!Requests is one of the most downloaded Python packages today, pulling in around `30M downloads / week`— according to GitHub, Requests is currently [depended upon](https://github.com/psf/requests/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS01NzA4OTExNg%3D%3D) by `1,000,000+` repositories. You may certainly put your trust in this code.[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/requests/month)](https://pepy.tech/project/requests)[![Supported Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/requests.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/requests)[![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/psf/requests.svg)](https://github.com/psf/requests/graphs/contributors)## Installing Requests and Supported VersionsRequests is available on PyPI:```console$ python -m pip install requests```Requests officially supports Python 3.7+.## Supported Features &amp; Best–PracticesRequests is ready for the demands of building robust and reliable HTTP–speaking applications, for the needs of today.- Keep-Alive &amp; Connection Pooling- International Domains and URLs- Sessions with Cookie Persistence- Browser-style TLS/SSL Verification- Basic &amp; Digest Authentication- Familiar `dict`–like Cookies- Automatic Content Decompression and Decoding- Multi-part File Uploads- SOCKS Proxy Support- Connection Timeouts- Streaming Downloads- Automatic honoring of `.netrc`- Chunked HTTP Requests## API Reference and User Guide available on [Read the Docs](https://requests.readthedocs.io)[![Read the Docs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psf/requests/main/ext/ss.png)](https://requests.readthedocs.io)## Cloning the repositoryWhen cloning the Requests repository, you may need to add the `-cfetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore` flag to avoid an error about a bad commit (see[this issue](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/2690) for more background):```shellgit clone -c fetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore https://github.com/psf/requests.git```You can also apply this setting to your global Git config:```shellgit config --global fetch.fsck.badTimezone ignore```---[![Kenneth Reitz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psf/requests/main/ext/kr.png)](https://kennethreitz.org) [![Python Software Foundation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psf/requests/main/ext/psf.png)](https://www.python.org/psf)</longdescription>
