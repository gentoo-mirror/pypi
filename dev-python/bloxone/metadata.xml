	<longdescription>============Introduction============The Infoblox BloxOne suite of applications provides a RESTful API that ispublished using Swagger on https://csp.infoblox.com/apidoc along with otherInfoblox APIs.This module aims to provide a class hierarchy to simplify access to thesepublished APIs, performing the 'heavy lifting' whilst providing full access toto their functionality. This is achieved by providing simple wrappers that enableyou to take the swagger documented object paths, fields and where appropriate JSON body from the documentation and pass them to simple get, create, delete andupdate methods. These methods simply return a *requests* response object.In addition, useful utility methods are provided for common tasks such as getting an object id, by defining the object key and value match pair. This iscombined with several (currently) undocumented API calls.Some basic configuration, such a base url, API version and API key are readfrom an ini file. An example of which is provided. When instantiating/initialisingthis will read config.ini by default. Alternatively a path can be provided.For more detailed documentation please see: https://python-bloxone.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PyPi:https://pypi.org/project/bloxone/GitHub:https://github.com/ccmarris/python-bloxoneAll feedback please to chris@infoblox.comThanksChris</longdescription>
