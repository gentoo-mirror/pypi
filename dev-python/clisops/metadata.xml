	<longdescription>clisops - climate simulation operations=======================================|pypi| |conda| |build| |coveralls| |docs| |black|The ``clisops`` package (pronounced &quot;clie-sops&quot;) provides a python library for running*data-reduction* operations on `Xarray &lt;http://xarray.pydata.org/&gt;`_ data sets or filesthat can be interpreted by Xarray. These basic operations (subsetting, averaging andregridding) are likely to work where data structures are NetCDF-centric, such as thosefound in ESGF data sets.``clisops`` is employed by the `daops &lt;https://github.com/roocs/daops&gt;`_ library to performits basic operations once ``daops`` has applied any necessary *fixes* to data in orderto remove irregularities/anomalies. Users are recommended to investigate using ``daops``directly in order to access these *fixes* which may affect the scientific credibility ofthe results.``clisops`` can be used stand-alone to read individual, or groups of, NetCDF files directly.* Free software: BSD* Documentation: https://clisops.readthedocs.io.Features--------The package provides the following operations:* subset* average* regridOnline Demo-----------..  todo: Links have to be adjusted to the master or respective branch!You can try clisops online using Binder (just click on the binder link below),or view the notebooks on NBViewer... image:: https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg   :target: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/roocs/clisops/master?filepath=notebooks   :alt: Binder Launcher.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg   :target: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/roocs/clisops/tree/master/notebooks/   :alt: NBViewer   :height: 20Credits-------This package was created with ``Cookiecutter`` and the ``audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`` project template.* Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter* cookiecutter-pypackage: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.. |pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/clisops.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/clisops   :alt: PyPI.. |conda| image:: https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/clisops.svg   :target: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/clisops   :alt: Conda Forge.. |build| image:: https://github.com/roocs/clisops/workflows/build/badge.svg   :target: https://github.com/roocs/clisops/actions   :alt: Build Status.. |coveralls| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/roocs/clisops/badge.svg?branch=master   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/roocs/clisops?branch=master   :alt: Coverage.. |docs| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/clisops/badge/?version=latest   :target: https://clisops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest   :alt: Documentation.. |black| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg   :target: https://github.com/python/black   :alt: Black</longdescription>
