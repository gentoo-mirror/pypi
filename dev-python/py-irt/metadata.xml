Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).2. Install [Pyro](https://pyro.ai/)3. Install py-irt:```shellpip install py-irt```ORInstall [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)```shellgit clone https://github.com/nd-ball/py-irt.gitcd py-irtpoetry install```## UsageOnce you install from PyPI, you can use the following command to fit an IRTmodel on the scored predictions of a dataset. For example, if you were to run py-irt with the 4PL model on the scored predictions of different transformer models on the SQuAD dataset, you'd do this:`py-irt train 4pl ~/path/to/dataset/eg/squad.jsonlines /path/to/output/eg/test-4pl/`## FAQ1. What kind of output should I expect on running the command to train an IRT model?You should see something like this when you run the command given above:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40918514/123986740-3eccd100-d9cf-11eb-8e58-ba5ad6c977ce.png)2. I tried installing py-irt using pip from PyPI. But when I try to run the command `py-irt train 4pl ~/path/to/dataset/eg/squad.jsonlines /path/to/output/eg/test-4pl/`, I get an error that says `bash: py-irt: command not found`. How do I fix this?The CLI interface was implemented in PyPi version 0.2.1. If you are getting this error try updating py-irt:`pip install --upgrade py-irt`Alternatively, you can install the latest version from github:```shellgit clone https://github.com/nd-ball/py-irt.gitcd py-irtmv ~/py-irt/py_irt/cli.py ~/py-irt/python cli.py train 4pl ~/path/to/dataset/eg/squad.jsonlines /path/to/output/eg/test-4pl/```3. How do I evaluate a trained IRT model?If you have already trained an IRT model you can use the following command:`py-irt evaluate 4pl ~/path/to/data/best_parameters.json ~/path/to/data/test_pairs.jsonlines /path/to/output/eg/test-4pl/`Where `test_pairs.jsonlines` is a jsonlines file with the following format:```{&quot;subject_id&quot;: &quot;ken&quot;, &quot;item_id&quot;: &quot;q1&quot;}{&quot;subject_id&quot;: &quot;ken&quot;, &quot;item_id&quot;: &quot;q2&quot;}{&quot;subject_id&quot;: &quot;burt&quot;, &quot;item_id&quot;: &quot;q1&quot;}{&quot;subject_id&quot;: &quot;burt&quot;, &quot;item_id&quot;: &quot;q3&quot;}```If you would like to both train and evaluate a model you can use the following command:`py-irt train-and-evaluate 4pl ~/path/to/data/squad.jsonlines /path/to/output/eg/test-4pl/`By default this will train a model with 90% of the provided data and evaluate with the remaining 10%.To change this behavior you can add `--evaluation all` to the command above. The model will train and evaluate against all of the data.## CitationsIf you use this code, please consider citing the following papers:```shell@inproceedings{lalor2019emnlp,  author    = {Lalor, John P and Wu, Hao and Yu, Hong},  title     = {Learning Latent Parameters without Human Response Patterns: Item Response Theory with Artificial Crowds},  year      = {2019},  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing},}``````shell@inproceedings{rodriguez2021evaluation,  title={Evaluation Examples Are Not Equally Informative: How Should That Change NLP Leaderboards?},  author={Rodriguez, Pedro and Barrow, Joe and Hoyle, Alexander Miserlis and Lalor, John P and Jia, Robin and Boyd-Graber, Jordan},  booktitle={Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers)},  pages={4486--4503},  year={2021}}```Implementation is based on the following paper:```shell@article{natesan2016bayesian,  title={Bayesian prior choice in IRT estimation using MCMC and variational Bayes},  author={Natesan, Prathiba and Nandakumar, Ratna and Minka, Tom and Rubright, Jonathan D},  journal={Frontiers in psychology},  volume={7},  pages={1422},  year={2016},  publisher={Frontiers}}```## ContributingThis is research code.
