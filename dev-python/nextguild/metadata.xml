Because of our commitment to make it as simple and easy to use as possible, it serves as an excellent resource for both beginners learning Python programming and experienced programmers looking for a straightforward development experience. Made from a team of 2 people, this was a project originally thought for a fun purpose and for testing of the Guilded API, which eventually turned into a API wrapper for multi-purpose use.Installation------------**[Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is required**```bash# MacOS / Linux (via Terminal)python3 -m pip install -U nextguild# Windows (via CMD Prompt)py -3 -m pip install -U nextguild```&lt;br&gt;NextGuild also requires 2 other packages to be installed before using it. &lt;br&gt;If you haven't installed them already, execute the following command in your terminal:```bashpip install requests websockets```## DocumentationFor NextGuild's official documentation, visit [this link](https://github.com/ArjunSharda/nextguild/tree/main/docs).## Founders[Arjun Sharda](https://github.com/ArjunSharda)&lt;br&gt;[Erik Thorsell](https://github.com/erik-thorsell)## ContributingPlease see the [CONTRIBUTING.MD](https://github.com/ArjunSharda/nextguild/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for the official guidelines to contribute.## License©️ The NextGuild Project (2023-present) is under the [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license, and usage of the library is subject to the terms of the MIT license.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h6 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;© The NextGuild Project 2023-present&lt;br&gt;All Rights Reserved&lt;/h6&gt;</longdescription>
