	<longdescription>**PgSanity checks the syntax of Postgresql SQL files.**It does this by leveraging the ecpg command which is traditionallyused for preparing C files with embedded sql for compilation.However, as part of that preparation, ecpg checks the embedded SQLstatements for syntax errors using the exact same parser that isin PostgreSQL.So the approach that PgSanity takes is to take a file that has alist of bare SQL in it, make that file look like a C file withembedded SQL, run it through ecpg and let ecpg report on the syntaxerrors of the SQL.</longdescription>
