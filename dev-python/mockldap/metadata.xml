	<longdescription>Status------**This project is unmaintained**. It was originally spun off ofdjango-auth-ldap, which no longer requires it. If you have a use for it, feelfree to copy the code for your own purposes (it's only for testing, after all).Documentation may still be available at https://mockldap.readthedocs.io/.</longdescription>
