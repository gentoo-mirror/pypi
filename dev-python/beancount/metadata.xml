	<longdescription>      A double-entry accounting system that uses text files as input.      Beancount defines a simple data format or &quot;language&quot; that lets you define      financial transaction records in a text file, load them in memory and      generate and export a variety of reports, such as balance sheets or income      statements. It also provides a client with an SQL-like query language to      filter and aggregate financial data, and a web interface which renders      those reports to HTML. Finally, it provides the scaffolding required to      automate the conversion of external data into one's input file in      Beancount syntax.      </longdescription>
