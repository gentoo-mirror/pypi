	<longdescription># FL Studio Python API StubsThis project contains function definitions to provide intellisense whileworking on scripts for FL Studio's Python API, as well as a partially-completemodel of FL Studio, which allows for scripts to be tested outside of FL Studio.## Online ReferenceThe documentation is also available as an[online reference](https://miguelguthridge.github.io/FL-Studio-API-Stubs) ifImage-Line's own documentation isn't up to scratch.## InstallationTo avoid module conflicts with other Python projects, it is recommended thatyou install this script in a virtual environment by following[these instructions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) in theofficial Python documentation.After activating the environment in your editor, you can install the stubmodules by running the command `pip install FL-Studio-API-Stubs` on Windows or`pip3 install FL-Studio-API-Stubs` on MacOS or Linux.[Video reference for installation instructions](https://youtu.be/6_KdXJIfeoI)## Testing using the FL Studio API StubsThis code provides a model of FL Studio which can be used to test basicfunctionality of projects using the API. The [fl_model](./src/fl_model/) module can be used forcontrolling the state of the model. Refer to its documentation for usageinstructions.## The Small PrintA couple of notes regarding this repo.### This Documentation isn't CompleteAlthough the stubs are mostly complete, there are a few functions where I don'tfully understand how they work. These functions have a `HELP WANTED:` label intheir documentation. If you happen to know how to use one, I'd love it if youhelped out by improving the documentation! I may also have incorrectdefinitions for some functions. Please[create an issue](https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/FL-Studio-API-Stubs/issues/new)if you find anything incorrect.### Differences to the Official ImplementationA small number of tweaks have been made to these stubs in order to ease codewriting. These shouldn't have any functional impact on the behavior of the APIcompared to the implied behavior from the stubs, but should help clarify someproperties of certain functions.* Functions where parameters or returns are boolean by nature are listed as  using a `bool` type, even though the implementation uses the integers `0` and  `1`. This change should help to describe the context in which the functions  should be called when writing scripts, which in a language like Python is far  more important than the actual implementation of the functions.## DevelopmentDependencies for this project are managed using[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). You'll need to[install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to develop it.To install the required dependencies, run `poetry install`.</longdescription>
