	<longdescription>Overview--------The ``mod_wsgi-httpd`` package is a companion package for mod_wsgi. It willcompile and install a copy of the Apache httpd server into your Pythoninstallation. If this is done, when the ``mod_wsgi`` package issubsequently installed, it will be compiled against the Apache httpd serverinstalled by this package. When ``mod_wsgi-express`` from the ``mod_wsgi``package is then run, it will also use the same Apache httpd server.This package therefore allows you to side step the fact that most Linuxdistributions and MacOS X ship out of date versions of the Apache httpdserver, allowing you to use the very latest version. It also allows you toinstall ``mod_wsgi-express`` where you don't control your operating systemand so don't have root access, and the Apache httpd server is notinstalled, or its companion ``dev`` packages are not installed, which are aprerequsite for being able to build mod_wsgi from source code.**NOTE: Although this package may allow you to install a newer Apacheversion, it is only really recommended that you use this package if youhave absolutely no other choice for getting the Apache httpd serverinstalled. Always use the Apache httpd server supplied with the operatingsystem if you can. Building this package if you do choose to do so, willtake some time. So if you you think the install is hanging, it is probablystill busy compiling everything.**Installation------------To install the Apache httpd server::    pip install -v mod_wsgi-httpdThe ``-v`` option enables you to see the output as everything is beingcompiled. This way you can better track that it is doing something andisn't hanging.To subsequently install the mod_wsgi package and mod_wsgi-express::    pip install mod_wsgiInstallation of each package needs to be done separately, you cannot listboth in a ``requirements.txt`` file because the ``mod_wsgi-httpd`` packagewill not be installed before ``pip`` processes the ``mod_wsgi`` package.As a result the installation of ``mod_wsgi`` may fail, or the system Apachewill still be used if available.If you need to install packages using ``pip`` from a ``requirements.txt``file, or other similar Python package installer, you should insteadinstall the ``mod_wsgi-standalone`` package. This is a special variantof the ``mod_wsgi`` package that will ensure that ``mod_wsgi-httpd`` isinstalled first. Ensure you have an up to date version of ``pip`` whichunderstands ``pyproject.toml`` files when using this option.To run mod_wsgi-express::    mod_wsgi-express start-serverYou can then access the server at::    http://localhost:8000/For more help on mod_wsgi-express see the documentation for the mod_wsgipackage and/or run::    mod_wsgi-express start-server --help</longdescription>
