It can also be used fortesting packages that are not affiliated with the Astropy project.This package also provides pytest markers for cpu and memory intensive tests(``pytest.mark.slow`` and ``pytest.mark.hugemem``). Tests marked with thosemarkers are not run by default, can be run with the other tests with``--run-slow`` and ``--run-hugemem``, and can be run separately with ``-m slow``and ``-m hugemem``.The package also provides the short option ``-R`` for ``--remote-data``... _astropy: https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/.. _affiliated packages: https://astropy.org/affiliatedDependencies------------The following dependencies are installed by this package:* The `pytest`_ testing framework for Python.* `pytest-astropy-header`_, a ``pytest`` plugin used for custom test header.* `pytest-remotedata`_, a ``pytest`` plugin used for controlling access to data  files hosted online.* `pytest-doctestplus`_, a ``pytest`` plugin that provides advanced features  for testing example code in documentation.* `pytest-arraydiff`_, a ``pytest`` plugin that enables the generation and  comparison of data arrays produced during unit tests.* `pytest-filter-subpackage`_, a ``pytest`` plugin that adds a ``-P`` option to  pytest to filter by sub-package.* `pytest-mock`_,  a thin-wrapper around the mock package for easier use  with ``pytest``.* `pytest-cov`_, a ``pytest`` plugin to measure test coverage.* `hypothesis`_, a Python library for property based testing... _pytest: https://doc.pytest.org.. _pytest-astropy-header: https://github.com/astropy/pytest-astropy-header.. _pytest-remotedata: https://github.com/astropy/pytest-remotedata.. _pytest-doctestplus: https://github.com/astropy/pytest-doctestplus.. _pytest-arraydiff: https://github.com/astropy/pytest-arraydiff.. _pytest-filter-subpackage: https://github.com/astropy/pytest-filter-subpackage.. _pytest-mock: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock.. _pytest-cov: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov.. _hypothesis: https://hypothesis.readthedocs.ioInstallation------------The ``pytest-astropy`` plugin can be installed using ``pip``::    $ pip install pytest-astropyIt is also possible to install the latest development version from the sourcerepository::    $ git clone https://github.com/astropy/pytest-astropy    $ cd pytest-astropy    $ python ./setup.py installIn either case, the plugin will automatically be registered for use with``pytest``.Development Status------------------Questions, bug reports, and feature requests can be submitted on `github`_... _github: https://github.com/astropy/pytest-astropyLicense-------This package is licensed under a 3-clause BSD style license - see the``LICENSE.rst`` file.</longdescription>
