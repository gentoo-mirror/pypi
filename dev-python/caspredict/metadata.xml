	<longdescription># CasPredictDetect CRISPR-Cas genes and arrays, and predict the subtype based on both Cas genes and CRISPR repeat sequence.[CasPredict and RepeatType are also available through a webserver](http://caspredict.crispr.dk)This software finds Cas genes with a large suite of HMMs, then groups these HMMs into operons, and predicts the subtype of the operons based on a scoring scheme.Furthermore, it finds CRISPR arrays with [minced](https://github.com/ctSkennerton/minced), and using a kmer-based machine learning approach (extreme gradient boosting trees) it predicts the subtype of the CRISPR arrays based on the consensus repeat. It then connects the Cas operons and CRISPR arrays, producing as output:* CRISPR-Cas loci, with consensus subtype prediction based on both Cas genes (mostly) and CRISPR consensus repeats* Orphan Cas operons, and their predicted subtype* Orphan CRISPR arrays, and their predicted associated subtype#### It includes the following subtypes:* All the ones in the most recent Nature Reviews Microbiology (Makarova et al. 2020): [Evolutionary classification of CRISPR–Cas systems: a burst of class 2 and derived variants](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-019-0299-x)* Updated type IV subtypes and variants based on: [Type IV CRISPR–Cas systems are highly diverse and involved in competition between plasmids](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz1197)* Type V-K: [RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aax9181)* Transposon associated type I-F: [Transposon-encoded CRISPR–Cas systems direct RNA-guided DNA integration](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1323-z)#### It can automatically draw gene maps of CRISPR-Cas systems and orphan Cas operons and CRISPR arrays&lt;img src='img/plot.png' align=&quot;left&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;#### CitationComing soon...# Table of contents1.

If the score is high then Prediction = Best_type* **crisprs_all.tab:**          All CRISPR arrays    * Contains a prediction of the associated subtype based on the repeat sequence (Prediction).     * The 'Subtype' column is the subtype with highest probability.

For example, the CRISPR_Cas.tab file is only created if there are any CRISPR-Cas loci. ### Plotting &lt;a name=&quot;plot&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;CasPredict will automatically plot a map of the CRISPR-Cas loci, orphan Cas operons, and orphan CRISPR arrays.These maps can be expanded (`--expand N`) by adding unknown genes and genes with alignment scores below the thresholds. This can help in identify potentially un-annotated genes in operons. You can generate new plots without having to re-run the entire pipeline by adding `--redo_typing` to the command. This will re-use the mappings and re-type the operons and re-make the plot, based on new thresholds and plot parameters.The plot below is run with `--expand 5`* Cas genes are in red.* Cas genes, with alignment scores below the thresholds, are in dark green* Unknown genes are in gray (the number matches the genes.tab file)* Arrays are in blue, with their predicted subtype association based on the consensus repeat sequence.&lt;img src='img/plot2.png' align=&quot;left&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;## RepeatType - How to &lt;a name=&quot;repeattype&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;With an input of CRISPR repeats (one per line, in a simple textfile) RepeatType will predict the subtype, based on the kmer composition of the repeat#### Activate environment```shconda activate caspredict```#### Run with a simple textfile, containing only CRISPR repeats (in capital letters), one repeat per line.```shrepeatType repeats.txt```#### Output &lt;a name=&quot;repeattypeout&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The script prints:* Repeat sequence* Predicted subtype* Probability of prediction#### Notes on output* Predictions with probabilities below 0.75 are uncertain, and should be taken with a grain of salt.* The classifier was only trained on the subtypes for which there were enough (&gt;20) repeats. It can therefore only predict subtypes of repeats associated with the following subtypes:    * I-A, I-B, I-C, I-D, I-E, I-F, I-G    * II-A, II-B, II-C    * III-A, III-B, III-C, III-D    * IV-A1, IV-A2, IV-A3    * V-A    * VI-B* This is the accuracy per subtype (on an unseen test dataset):    * **I-A**      0.60    * **I-B**      0.90    * **I-C**      0.98    * **I-D**      0.47    * **I-E**      1.00    * **I-F**      0.99    * **I-G**      0.83    * **II-A**     0.94    * **II-B**     1.00    * **II-C**     0.89    * **III-A**    0.89    * **III-B**    0.49    * **III-C**    0.60    * **III-D**    0.28    * **IV-A1**    0.79    * **IV-A2**    0.78    * **IV-A3**    0.98    * **V-A**      0.77    * **VI-B**     1.00## RepeatType - Train &lt;a name=&quot;repeattrain&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You can train the repeat classifier with your own set of subtyped repeats. With a tab-delimeted input where 1. column contains the subtypes and 2. column contains the CRISPR repeat sequences, RepeatTrain will train a CRISPR repeat classifier that is directly usable for both RepeatType and CasPredict.#### Train```shrepeatTrain typed_repeats.tab my_classifier```#### Use new model in RepeatType```shrepeatType repeats.txt --db my_classifier```#### Use new model in CasPredictSave the original database files:```shmv ${CASPREDICT_DB}/type_dict.tab ${CASPREDICT_DB}/type_dict_orig.tabmv ${CASPREDICT_DB}/xgb_repeats.model ${CASPREDICT_DB}/xgb_repeats_orig.model```Move the new model into the database folder```shmv my_classifier/* ${CASPREDICT_DB}/```##### CasPredict and RepeatType will now use the new model for repeat prediction!</longdescription>
