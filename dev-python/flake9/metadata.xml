	<longdescription>======== Flake9========Flake9 is a fork of Flake8 that supports reading configuration from a``pyproject.toml`` file, because the authors of Flake8 won't implement it.In addition, because it's 2020, Python 2.7 support has been dropped.Here's an example of the ``pyproject.toml`` file::    [tool.flake8]    ignore = &quot;E203,E266,H106,H904&quot;    max-line-length = 88    max-complexity = 25    hang-closing = true======================== Original Flake8 README========================Flake8 is a wrapper around these tools:- PyFlakes- pycodestyle- Ned Batchelder's McCabe scriptFlake8 runs all the tools by launching the single ``flake8`` command.It displays the warnings in a per-file, merged output.It also adds a few features:- files that contain this line are skipped::    # flake8: noqa- lines that contain a ``# noqa`` comment at the end will not issue warnings.- you can ignore specific errors on a line with ``# noqa: &lt;error&gt;``, e.g.,  ``# noqa: E234``. Multiple codes can be given, separated by comma. The ``noqa`` token is case insensitive, the colon before the list of codes is required otherwise the part after ``noqa`` is ignored- Git and Mercurial hooks- extendable through ``flake8.extension`` and ``flake8.formatting`` entry  pointsQuickstart==========See our `quickstart documentation&lt;http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html#quickstart&gt;`_ for how to installand get started with Flake8.Frequently Asked Questions==========================Flake8 maintains an `FAQ &lt;http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/faq.html&gt;`_ in itsdocumentation.Questions or Feedback=====================If you have questions you'd like to ask the developers, or feedback you'd liketo provide, feel free to use the mailing list: code-quality@python.orgWe would love to hear from you. Additionally, if you have a feature you'd liketo suggest, the mailing list would be the best place for it.Links=====* `Flake8 Documentation &lt;http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/&gt;`_* `GitLab Project &lt;https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8&gt;`_* `All (Open and Closed) Issues  &lt;https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues?scope=all&amp;sort=updated_desc&amp;state=all&gt;`_* `Code-Quality Archives  &lt;https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/code-quality&gt;`_* `Code of Conduct  &lt;http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/internal/contributing.html#code-of-conduct&gt;`_* `Getting Started Contributing  &lt;http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/internal/contributing.html&gt;`_Maintenance===========Flake8 was created by Tarek Ziad√© and is currently maintained by `Ian Cordasco&lt;http://www.coglib.com/~icordasc/&gt;`_</longdescription>
