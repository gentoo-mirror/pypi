	<longdescription># flashfocusSimple focus animations for tiling window managers.![Demo gif](demo/demo.gif)&lt;br&gt;Compatible with sway as well as all X based window managers (i3, bspwm, awesome-wm, xmonad...).Flashfocus is currently pretty stable and I don't have any major features inthe works, however the project is still actively maintained and featurerequests are always welcome :)## InstallationFor X based window managers, an active window compositor is required for the effects of flashfocusto be noticeable. If you don't have one setup already, I recommend[picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom).### ArchInstall from the Arch User Repository: `flashfocus`### Ubuntu/Debian```sudo apt-get install libxcb-render0-dev libffi-dev python-dev python-cffipip install flashfocus```### Fedora```dnf install libffi-devel python-devel python-cffipip install flashfocus```### openSUSEFlashfocus is in the official repository of openSUSE Tumbleweed.openSUSE Leap users can install it from the [X11:Utilities](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/X11%3AUtilities/flashfocus) devel project:```zypper ar obs://X11:Utilities x11utilzypper refzypper in flashfocus```### Nix / NixOSDeclaratively in `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix````environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [  flashfocus];```Ad hoc```nix-env -iA nixpkgs.flashfocus```## Quickstart#### Picom setupThe following must be present in your picom config file:```detect-client-opacity = true;```If you use i3, the following is also required for flashfocus to work with tabbed containers:```opacity-rule = [  &quot;0:_NET_WM_STATE@:32a *= '_NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN'&quot;];```#### Running flashfocusFlashfocus should be added to your startup programs. E.g for i3 place thefollowing in your config:```exec_always --no-startup-id flashfocus```The `flash_window` script can be used to flash the current window on key-press. E.g if you'd like to bind to mod+n in i3:```bindsym $mod+n exec --no-startup-id flash_window```## ConfigurationFlashfocus can be configured via its config file or with command line parameters. Some features, such as window-specific flash customization, are only available through the config file.The config file is searched for in the following locations:1. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/flashfocus/flashfocus.yml2. ~/.config/flashfocus/flashfocus.yml3. ~/.flashfocus.ymlWhen flashfocus is first run it creates a default config file in 1. or 2. Documentation of all configuration options is present in the config file.See the [wiki](https://github.com/fennerm/flashfocus/wiki) for some extra docs.</longdescription>
