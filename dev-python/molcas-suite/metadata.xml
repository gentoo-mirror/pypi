The automatic generation of this documentation relies on a common layout for comments and docstrings within the code, see [contributing](https://gitlab.com/chilton-group/group-wiki/-/wikis/Contributing:-General) for more information.# DevelopmentBefore making changes to this repository, please follow the steps outlined in the [Chilton group wiki](https://gitlab.com/chilton-group/group-wiki/-/wikis/Contributing:-General).# BugsIf you believe you have a bug, *please check that you are using the most up to date version of the code*. If that does not fix the problem, please create an issue on GitLab detailing the following: - The commands you entered - The error messageRemember to simplify the problem as much as possible in order to provide a minimum working example, e.g. an example for a small molecule rather than one with 100000 atoms.Then, look at the code, try and figure out what you think is wrong if possible, and include this in your issue.</longdescription>
