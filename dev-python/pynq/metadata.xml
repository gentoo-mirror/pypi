	<longdescription>![pynq_logo](https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ/raw/master/logo.png)![python](https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ/workflows/Python/badge.svg)PYNQ is an open-source project from Xilinx that makes it easy to design embedded systems with Zynq All Programmable Systems on Chips (APSoCs). Using the Python language and libraries, designers can exploit the benefits of programmable logic and microprocessors in Zynq to build more capable and exciting embedded systems.PYNQ users can now create high performance embedded applications with-parallel hardware execution-high frame-rate video processing-hardware accelerated algorithms-real-time signal processing-high bandwidth IO-low latency controlSee the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pynq.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PYNQ webpage&lt;/a&gt; for an overview of the project, and find &lt;a href=&quot;http://pynq.readthedocs.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation on ReadTheDocs&lt;/a&gt; to get started. ## Precompiled ImageThe project currently supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pynq.io/board.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;multiple boards&lt;/a&gt;. You can download a precompiled image, write the image to a micro SD card, and boot the board from the micro SD card. ## Quick StartSee the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Quickstart guide&lt;/a&gt; for details on writing the image to an SD card, and getting started with a PYNQ-enabled board.## Python Source CodeAll Python code for the `pynq` package can be found in the `/pynq` folder. This folder can be found on the board after the board boots with the precompiled image.To update your PYNQ SD card to the latest `pynq` package, you can run the following command from a terminal connected to your board:```consolesudo pip3 install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy only-if-needed pynq```The `--upgrade-strategy only-if-needed` option will upgrade dependencies only in case they do not satisfy the requirements, which will speed-up the installation process and also avoid possible upgrade errors.SDK software projects and Python-C source codes are also stored along with the Python source code. After installing the `pynq` package, the compiled target files will be saved automatically into the `pynq` package.## Board Files and OverlaysAll board related files including Vivado projects, bitstreams, and example notebooks, can be found in the `/boards` folder.In Linux, you can rebuild the overlay by running *make* in the corresponding overlay folder (e.g. `/boards/Pynq-Z1/base`). In Windows, you need to source the appropriate tcl files in the corresponding overlay folder.## Alveo supportStarting from PYNQ version `2.5.1`, Alveo support has also been introduced. It is now possible to use PYNQ to tap into the potential of hardware acceleration in the data center space.To get PYNQ on an Alveo-enabled system, simply install it through PIP:```consolepip install pynq```For Alveo cards, PYNQ currently requires a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Xilinx/XRT&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Xilinx Runtime (XRT)&lt;/a&gt; version above or equal to `2.3` to be installed in the system. In terms of Operating System, any XRT-supported version of either RedHat/CentOS or Ubuntu can be used.For more information, please see the Alveo &lt;a href=&quot;https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/alveo_getting_started.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;getting started guide&lt;/a&gt;.## ContributeContributions to this repository are welcomed.
