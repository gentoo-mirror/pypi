	<longdescription>nose extends the test loading and running features of unittest, making    it easier to write, find and run tests.    By default, nose will run tests in files or directories under the current    working directory whose names include &quot;test&quot; or &quot;Test&quot; at a word boundary    (like &quot;test_this&quot; or &quot;functional_test&quot; or &quot;TestClass&quot; but not    &quot;libtest&quot;). Test output is similar to that of unittest, but also includes    captured stdout output from failing tests, for easy print-style debugging.    These features, and many more, are customizable through the use of    plugins. Plugins included with nose provide support for doctest, code    coverage and profiling, flexible attribute-based test selection,    output capture and more. More information about writing plugins may be    found on in the nose API documentation, here:    http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/    If you have recently reported a bug marked as fixed, or have a craving for    the very latest, you may want the development version instead:    https://github.com/nose-devs/nose/tarball/master#egg=nose-dev</longdescription>
