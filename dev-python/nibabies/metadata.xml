	<longdescription>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires a set of preprocessing steps beforeany statistical analysis. In an effort to standardize preprocessing,we developed [fMRIPrep](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/) (a preprocessing toolfor functional MRI, fMRI), and generalized its standardization approach toother neuroimaging modalities ([NiPreps](https://www.nipreps.org/)). NiPrepsbrings standardization and ease of use to the researcher, and effectivelylimits the methodological variability within preprocessing. fMRIPrep is designedto be used across wide ranges of populations; however it is designed for (andevaluated with) human adult datasets. Infant MRI (i.e., 0-2 years) presentsunique challenges due to head size (e.g., reduced SNR and increased partialvoluming and rapid shifting in tissue contrast due to myelination. These andother challenges require a more specialized workflow. *NiBabies*, an open-sourcepipeline extending from fMRIPrep for infant structural and functional MRIpreprocessing, aims to address this need.The workflow is built atop [Nipype](https://nipype.readthedocs.io) and encompases a largeset of tools from well-known neuroimaging packages, including[FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/),[ANTs](https://stnava.github.io/ANTs/),[FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/),[AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/),[Connectome Workbench](https://humanconnectome.org/software/connectome-workbench),and [Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/).This pipeline was designed to provide the best software implementation for each state ofpreprocessing, and will be updated as newer and better neuroimaging software becomesavailable.*NiBabies* performs basic preprocessing steps (coregistration, normalization, unwarping,segmentation, skullstripping etc.) providing outputs that can beeasily submitted to a variety of group level analyses, including task-based or resting-statefMRI, graph theory measures, surface or volume-based statistics, etc.*NiBabies* allows you to easily do the following:  * Take fMRI data from *unprocessed* (only reconstructed) to ready for analysis.  * Implement tools from different software packages.  * Achieve optimal data processing quality by using the best tools available.  * Generate preprocessing-assessment reports, with which the user can easily identify problems.  * Receive verbose output concerning the stage of preprocessing for each subject, including    meaningful errors.  * Automate and parallelize processing steps, which provides a significant speed-up from    typical linear, manual processing.[Repository](https://github.com/nipreps/nibabies)[Documentation](https://nibabies.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)</longdescription>
