	<longdescription>splice======A Python interface to splice(2) system call.About-----`splice(2) &lt;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/splice.2.html&gt;`__ movesdata between two file descriptors without copying between kerneladdress space and user address space.  It transfers up to ``nbytes`` bytesof data from the file descriptor ``in`` to the file descriptor ``out``.zero-copy---------Normally when you copy data from one data stream to another, the datato be copied is first stored in a buffer in userspace and is thencopied back to the target data stream from the user space whichintroduces a certain overhead.zero-copy allows us to operate on data without the use of copying data to userspace. It essentialy transfers the data by remapping pagesand not actually performing the copying of data, resulting in improved performance.Illustrated below is a simple example of copying data from one fileto another using the ``splice(2)`` system call. For the complete documentationsee `API Documentation`_... code-block:: python    # copy data from one file to another using splice    from splice import splice    to_read = open(&quot;read.txt&quot;)    to_write = open(&quot;write.txt&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;)    splice(to_read.fileno(), to_write.fileno())This copying of the data twice (once into the userland buffer, and once outfrom that userland buffer) imposes some performance and resource penalties.`splice(2) &lt;http://linux.die.net/man/2/splice&gt;`__ syscall avoids thesepenalties by avoiding any use of userland buffers; it also results in a singlesystem call (and thus only one context switch), rather than the series of`read(2) &lt;http://linux.die.net/man/2/read&gt;`__ /`write(2) &lt;http://linux.die.net/man/2/write&gt;`__ system calls (each system callrequiring a context switch) used internally for the data copying.API Documentation-----------------sendfile module provides a single function: sendfile().* ``splice.splice(out, in, offset, nbytes, flags)``  Copy *nbytes* bytes from file descriptor *in* (a regular file) to file  descriptor *out* (a regular file) starting at *offset*. Return the number of  bytes just being sent. When the end of file is reached return 0.  If *offset* is not specified, the bytes are read from the current  position of *in* and the position of *in* is updated. If *nbytes* is  not specified, the whole of *in* is copied over to *out*.  **Required arguments**    - ``in``: file descriptor of the file from which data is to be read.  - ``out``: file descriptor of the file to which data is to be transferred.  **Positional optional arguments**    - ``offset``: offset from where the input file is read from.  - ``nbytes``: number of bytes to be copied in total, default value  - ``flags``: a bit mask which can be composed by ORing together the following.        + ``splice.SPLICE_F_MOVE``      + ``splice.SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK``      + ``splice.SPLICE_F_MORE``      + ``splice.SPLICE_F_GIFT``  More information on what each of the flag means can be found on the splice(2)  man page `here &lt;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/splice.2.html&gt;`__.Usage-----.. code-block:: python    &gt;&gt;&gt; from splice import splice    # init file objects    &gt;&gt;&gt; to_read = open(&quot;read.txt&quot;) # file to read from    &gt;&gt;&gt; to_write = open(&quot;write.txt&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;) # file to write to    &gt;&gt;&gt; len(to_read.read())    50    # copying whole file    &gt;&gt;&gt; splice(to_read.fileno(), to_write.fileno())    50  # bytes copied    # copying file starting from an offset    &gt;&gt;&gt; splice(to_read.fileno(), to_write.fileno(), offset=10)    40    # copying certain amount of bytes    &gt;&gt;&gt; splice(to_read.fileno(), to_write.fileno(), nbytes=20)    20    # copying certain amount of bytes beginning from an offset    &gt;&gt;&gt; splice(to_read.fileno(), to_write.fileno(), offset=10, nbytes=20)    20    # specifying flags    &gt;&gt;&gt; import splice    &gt;&gt;&gt; splice(to_read.fileno(), to_write.fileno(), flags=splice.SPLICE_F_MORE)    50Why would I use this?---------------------``splice(2)`` is supposed to be better in terms of performance when comparedto traditional read/write methods since it avoids overhead of copying thedata to user address space and instead, does the transfer by remapping pagesin kernel address space.Supported platforms-------------------The ``splice(2)`` system call is (GNU)Linux-specific.Support-------Feel free to add improvements, report issues or contact me about anything related to the project.LICENSE-------GNU GPL</longdescription>
