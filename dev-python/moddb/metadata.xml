	<longdescription># ModDB Reader**Library is now stable**The goal of the library is to be able to navigate ModDB purely programmatically through scraping and parsing of the various models present on the website. This is based off a command of my bot which can parse either a game or a mod, this command gave birth to the original library which was extremely limited in its abilities and only able to parse a few pages with inconsistencies. This library is a much more mature and professional attempt at the whole idea, adding on a much deeper understanding of OOP.## Basic UsageThe simplest way to use this library is to simply pass a ModDB url to the parse function and let the magic happen.```pyimport moddbmod = moddb.parse_page(&quot;http://www.moddb.com/mods/edain-mod&quot;)print(mod.name) #Edain Mod```## Advanced UsageCheck out the [documentation](https://moddb.readthedocs.io) for more information[Support](https://discord.gg/Ape8bZt)## InstallingYou can get it from pypi: https://pypi.org/project/moddb```pip install moddb```## Models* [x] Mod* [x] Game  * [x] Engine* [x] File* [x] Media* [x] Addon* [x] Article* [x] Blog* [x] User* [x] Team* [x] Group* [x] Job* [x] Search Page* [x] Front Page* [x] Platforms* [x] Software* [x] HardwAre* [x] Updates* [x] Friend Requests* [x] Watchers* [x] TagsMaybe* [ ] Messages* [ ] Threads## Glossary* **Partial[Model]**: A version of the model which does not contain all the attributes of the full model. Mainly because that model is being displayed as a preview in another page. Not to confuse with Thumbnails, Thumbnails are only guaranteed to contain a name and url of the page.* **Boxes**: Containers present on pages, a **div** tag which contains information around a certain theme and as such have been grouped into Box Models of such.* **Pages**: Another name for Models.* **Thumbnails**: A very widely used model meant to represent models which are references but not expanded onto. Usually the model in question will only include a url and the name of the page. This is transformed into a thumbnail and the user can then parse it with the built-in method.## DevelopmentThe necessary dependencies are stored in requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt and can be installed with the following command```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt```</longdescription>
