The data structures are used both internally and for  model input/outputs. In contrast to solutions found in other projects, such as  lists of Numpy arrays, ``TSCDataFrame`` makes it much easier to describe many forms of  time series data in a single object.* An efficient implementation of the ``DiffusionMaps`` model to infer geometric  meaningful structures from data, such as the eigenfunctions of the  Laplace-Beltrami operator. As a distinguishing factor to other implementations, the  model can handle a sparse kernel matrix and allows setting an arbitrary kernel,  including the standard Gaussian kernel,  `continuous k-nearest neighbor kernel &lt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02353&gt;`__, or  `dynamics-adapted cone kernel &lt;https://cims.nyu.edu/~dimitris/files/Giannakis15_cone_kernels.pdf&gt;`__.* Out-of-sample extensions for the Diffusion Maps model, such as the (auto-tuned)  Laplacian Pyramids or Geometric Harmonics to interpolate general function values on a  point cloud manifold.* An implementation of the (Extended-) Dynamic Mode Decomposition (e.g. model ``DMDFull``  or ``EDMD``) as data-driven methods to identify dynamical systems from time series  collection data. ``EDMD`` subclasses from the flexible scikit-learn  `Pipeline &lt;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html&gt;`__,  which allows setting up and transforming time series collection data to a more suitable  feature state (cf. Koopman operator theory).* ``EDMDCV`` allows model parameters to be optimized with cross-validation splittings that  account for the temporal order in time series collections.See also `this introduction page &lt;https://datafold-dev.gitlab.io/datafold/intro.html&gt;`__.For a mathematical thorough introduction, we refer to the `scientific literature&lt;https://datafold-dev.gitlab.io/datafold/references.html&gt;`__... note::    The project is under active development in a research-driven environment.    * Code quality varies from &quot;experimental/early stage&quot; to &quot;well-tested&quot;. Well tested      code is listed in the      `software documentation &lt;https://datafold-dev.gitlab.io/datafold/api.html&gt;`__      and are directly accessible through the package levels ``pcfold``, ``dynfold`` or      ``appfold`` (e.g. :code:`from datafold.dynfold import ...`). Experimental code is      only accessible via &quot;deep imports&quot;      (e.g. :code:`from datafol.dynfold.outofsample import ...`) and may raise a warning      when using it.    * There is no deprecation cycle. Backwards compatibility is indicated by the      package version, where we use a `semantic versioning &lt;https://semver.org/&gt;`__      policy `[major].[minor].[patch]`, i.e.         * `major` - making incompatible changes in the (documented) API         * `minor` - adding functionality in a backwards-compatible manner         * `patch` - backwards-compatible bug fixes      We do not intend to indicate a feature complete milestone with version `1.0`.Cite====If you use *datafold* in your research, please cite`this paper &lt;https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02283&gt;`__ published in the*Journal of Open Source Software* (`JOSS &lt;https://joss.theoj.org/&gt;`__).*Lehmberg et al., (2020). datafold: data-driven models for point clouds and time series onmanifolds.

Bothpackages usually ship with a standard Python installation. The package dependenciesinstall automatically. The main dependencies and their role in *datafold* are listed belowin &quot;Dependencies&quot;.There are two ways to install *datafold*:1. From PyPI------------This is the standard way for users. The package is hosted on the official Python packageindex (PyPI) and installs the core package (excluding tutorials and tests). The tutorialfiles can be downloaded separately`here &lt;https://datafold-dev.gitlab.io/datafold/tutorial_index.html&gt;`__.To install the package and its dependencies with :code:`pip`, run.. code-block:: bash   python -m pip install datafold.. note::    If you run Python in an Anaconda environment you can use pip from within ``conda``.    See also    `official instructions &lt;https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html#installing-non-conda-packages&gt;`__.    .. code-block:: bash        conda activate venv        conda install pip        pip install datafold2.

Clone the repository with      .. code-block:: bash        git clone https://gitlab.com/datafold-dev/datafold.git   b. If you only want access to the source code (current ``master`` branch), download one      of the compressed files      (`zip &lt;https://gitlab.com/datafold-dev/datafold/-/archive/master/datafold-master.zip&gt;`__,      `tar.gz &lt;https://gitlab.com/datafold-dev/datafold/-/archive/master/datafold-master.tar.gz&gt;`__,      `tar.bz2 &lt;https://gitlab.com/datafold-dev/datafold/-/archive/master/datafold-master.tar.bz2&gt;`__,      `tar &lt;https://gitlab.com/datafold-dev/datafold/-/archive/master/datafold-master.tar&gt;`__)2. Install the package from the downloaded repository   .. code-block:: bash       python -m pip install .Contributing============Any contribution (code/tutorials/documentation improvements), question or feedback isvery welcome. Either use the`issue tracker &lt;https://gitlab.com/datafold-dev/datafold/-/issues&gt;`__ or`Email &lt;incoming+datafold-dev-datafold-14878376-issue-@incoming.gitlab.com&gt;`__.Instructions to set up *datafold* for development can be found`here &lt;https://datafold-dev.gitlab.io/datafold/contributing.html&gt;`__.Dependencies============The dependencies of the core package are managed in the file`requirements.txt &lt;https://gitlab.com/datafold-dev/datafold/-/blob/master/requirements.txt&gt;`__and install with *datafold*. The tests, tutorials, documentation and code analysisrequire additional dependencies which are managed in`requirements-dev.txt &lt;https://gitlab.com/datafold-dev/datafold/-/blob/master/requirements-dev.txt&gt;`__.*datafold* integrates with common packages from the`Python scientific computing stack &lt;https://www.scipy.org/about.html&gt;`__:* `NumPy &lt;https://numpy.org/&gt;`__   The data structure ``PCManifold`` subclasses from NumPy's   `ndarray &lt;https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html&gt;`__. The   class attaches an kernel object to the data to describe point similarity.   NumPy is used throughout *datafold* and is the default package for numerical   data and algorithms.* `pandas &lt;https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html&gt;`__   *datafold* uses pandas'   `DataFrame &lt;https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html&gt;`__   as a base class for ``TSCDataFrame``, which captures time series data and   collections thereof. The data structure indexes time, time series ID and   one-or-many spatial features. It includes specific time series collection functionality   and is compatible with pandas rich functionality.* `scikit-learn &lt;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/&gt;`__   All *datafold* algorithms that are part of the &quot;machine learning pipeline&quot; align   to the scikit-learn `API &lt;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html&gt;`__.   This is done by deriving the models from   `BaseEstimator &lt;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.BaseEstimator.html&gt;`__.   and appropriate `MixIns`. *datafold* defines own `MixIns` that align with the   API in a duck-typing fashion to allow identifying dynamical systems from temporal data   in ``TSCDataFrame``.* `SciPy &lt;https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html&gt;`__   The package is used for elementary numerical algorithms and data structures in   conjunction with NumPy. This includes (sparse) linear least   square regression, (sparse) eigenpairs solver and sparse matrices as   optional data structure for kernel matrices.How does it compare to other software?======================================*The selection only includes other Python packages.** `scikit-learn &lt;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/&gt;`__   provides algorithms and models along the entire machine learning pipeline, with a   strong focus on static data (i.e. without temporal context). *datafold* integrates   into scikit-learn' API and all data-driven models are subclasses of   `BaseEstimator &lt;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.BaseEstimator.html&gt;`__.   An important contribution of *datafold* is the ``DiffusionMaps`` model as popular   framework for manifold learning, which is not contained in scikit-learn's `set of   algorithms &lt;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/manifold/plot_compare_methods   .html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-manifold-plot-compare-methods-py&gt;`__.   Furthermore, *datafold* includes dynamical systems as a new model class that is   operable with scikit-learn - the attributes align to supervised learning tasks.   The key differences are that a model processes data of type ``TSCDataFrame``   and instead of a one-to-one relation in the model's input/output, the model can return   arbitrary many output samples (a time series) for a single input   (an initial condition).* `PyDMD &lt;https://mathlab.github.io/PyDMD/build/html/index.html&gt;`__   provides many variants of the `Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_mode_decomposition&gt;`__.   *datafold* provides a wrapper to make models of ``PyDMD`` accessible. However, a   limitation of ``PyDMD`` is that it only processes single coherent time series, see   `PyDMD issue 86 &lt;https://github.com/mathLab/PyDMD/issues/86&gt;`__. The DMD models that   are directly included in *datafold* utilize the functionality of the data   structure ``TSCDataFrame`` and can therefore process time   series collections - in an extreme case only containing snapshot pairs.* `PySINDy &lt;https://pysindy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`__   specializes on a *sparse* system identification of nonlinear dynamical systems to   infer governing equations.</longdescription>
