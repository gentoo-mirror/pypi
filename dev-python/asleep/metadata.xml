	<longdescription># asleep: a sleep classifier for wearable sensor data using machine learningThis is a Python package for classifying sleep stages from wearable sensor data / wrist - worn accelerometer. The underlying modelwas trained and tested in 1000 + nights of multi - centre polysomnography with tri - axial accelerometer data.The key features of this package are as follows:* A simple and easy - to - use API for sleep stage classification.* Sleep / wake metric estimation including total sleep duration and sleep efficiency.* Sleep architecture metric estimation including rapid - eye - movement(REM) / NREM sleep duration.![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OxWearables/asleep/main/assets/figure.jpg)# Dependencies- Python 3.8+- Java 8 (1.8.0) or greaterCheck with:```bash$ python --version$ java -version```# Installation```bash$ pip install asleep```# UsageAll the processing will be much faster after the first time because the model weights will to have to be downloadedthe first time that the package is used.```shell# Process an AX3 file$ get_sleep sample.cwa# Or an ActiGraph file$ get_sleep sample.gt3x# Or a GENEActiv file$ get_sleep sample.bin# Or a CSV file (see data format below)$ get_sleep sample.csv```Output```shellSummary-------{    &quot;Filename&quot;: &quot;sample.cwa&quot;,    &quot;Filesize(MB)&quot;: 65.1,    &quot;Device&quot;: &quot;Axivity&quot;,    &quot;DeviceID&quot;: 2278,    &quot;ReadErrors&quot;: 0,    &quot;SampleRate&quot;: 100.0,    &quot;ReadOK&quot;: 1,    &quot;StartTime&quot;: &quot;2013-10-21 10:00:07&quot;,    &quot;EndTime&quot;: &quot;2013-10-28 10:00:01&quot;,    &quot;Total sleep duration(min)&quot;: 655.7,    &quot;Total overnight sleep(min)&quot;: 43132,    ...}Estimated total sleep duration---------------------              total sleep duration(min)time2013 - 10 - 21     435.22013 - 10 - 22     436.22013 - 10 - 23    432.2...Output: outputs / sample/```# Processing CSV filesIf a CSV file is provided, it must have the following header: time, x, y, z.Example:```shelltime, x, y, z2013 - 10 - 21 10: 00: 08.000, -0.078923, 0.396706, 0.9177592013 - 10 - 21 10: 00: 08.010, -0.094370, 0.381479, 0.9335802013 - 10 - 21 10: 00: 08.020, -0.094370, 0.366252, 0.9019382013 - 10 - 21 10: 00: 08.030, -0.078923, 0.411933, 0.901938```# CitationIf you want to use our package for your project, please cite our paper below:TBD# AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank all our code contributors, manuscript co - authors, and research participants for their help in making this work possible. Thedata processing pipeline of this repository is based on the [step_count](https://github.com/OxWearables/stepcount) package from our group. Specialthanks to @chanshing for his help in developing the package.</longdescription>
