We'll be delighted to receive yourfeedback in the form of issues and pull requests.

You are encouragedto adapt and override them to your project's requirements.This addon provides a ``default`` template for all instances. You can provideadditional template choices by adding a ``DJANGOCMS_FILE_TEMPLATES``setting::    DJANGOCMS_FILE_TEMPLATES = [        ('feature', _('Featured Version')),    ]You'll need to create the ``feature`` folder inside ``templates/djangocms_file/``otherwise you will get a *template does not exist* error. You can do this bycopying the ``default`` folder inside that directory and renaming it to``feature``.Running Tests-------------You can run tests by executing::    virtualenv env    source env/bin/activate    pip install -r test_requirements/base.txt    python setup.py test.. |pypi| image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/djangocms-file.svg    :target: http://badge.fury.io/py/djangocms-file.. |build| image:: https://travis-ci.org/django-cms/djangocms-file.svg?branch=master    :target: https://travis-ci.org/divio/djangocms-file.. |coverage| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/django-cms/djangocms-file/branch/master/graph/badge.svg    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/divio/djangocms-file.. |python| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.5+-blue.svg    :target: https://pypi.org/project/djangocms-file/.. |django| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/django-2.2--4.0-blue.svg    :target: https://www.djangoproject.com/.. |djangocms| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/django%20CMS-3.7%2B-blue.svg    :target: https://www.django-cms.org/Updating from `cmsplugin-filer &lt;https://github.com/django-cms/cmsplugin-filer&gt;`_--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Historically, `cmsplugin-filer` was used to create file, folder, image, link, teaser &amp; video plugins on your django CMS projects. Now `cmsplugin-filer` has been archived, you can still migrate your old instances without having to copy them manually to the new `djangocms-&lt;file|picture|link|...&gt;` plugins.There's a third-party management command that supports your migration:`migrate_cmsplugin_filer.py &lt;https://gist.github.com/corentinbettiol/84a6ea7e4d047fc01861b0af15fd60f0&gt;`_This management command is only a starting point. It *has* worked out of the box for some people, but we encourage you to read the code, understand what it does, and test it on a development environment before running it on your production server.The management command is only configured to transfer your `cmsplugin_link`, `cmsplugin_file`, `cmsplugin_folder` and `cmsplugin_image` plugins to modern `djangocms_*` plugins. If you need to transfer other `cmsplugin_*` plugins, you'll have to write your own code.Alternatively you can use the `deprecate_cmsplugin_filer &lt;https://github.com/ImaginaryLandscape/deprecate_cmsplugin_filer&gt;`_ app, which only adds a small migration that transfer the old `cmsplugin-filer` plugins instances to the new `djangocms-&lt;file|picture|link|...&gt;` plugins.</longdescription>
