	<longdescription># aiobastion**aiobastion** is a simple and fully asynchronous framework for [Cyberark API](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/PAS/Latest/en/Content/WebServices/Implementing%20Privileged%20Account%20Security%20Web%20Services%20.htm) written in Python 3.11 with [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) and [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp). It helps you to manage your Cyberark implementation faster and in an intuitive way.## ExamplesSee [examples of usage](https://aiobastion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/started.html#examples) in the [documentation](https://aiobastion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)## Quick (and dirty) start### List safesHere's a minimal python snippet to list safes```python import aiobastionimport asynciofrom aiobastion import GetTokenExceptionasync def main():    # Define your PVWA host here    pvwa_host = &quot;pvwa.mycompany.fr&quot;    vault = aiobastion.EPV(serialized={'api_host': pvwa_host})        # Define login and password    login = input(&quot;Login: &quot;)    password = input(&quot;Password: &quot;)    # Login to the PVWA    try:        await vault.login(login, password)    except GetTokenException as err:        print(f&quot;An error occured while login : {err}&quot;)        await vault.close_session()        exit(0)    # Working with PVWA    async with vault as epv:        # For example, listing all safes        safes = await epv.safe.list()        for s in safes:            print(s)if __name__ == '__main__':    asyncio.run(main())```## Getting started[Define a config file](https://aiobastion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/login.html#define-a-configuration-file), and start using functions to avoid spending hours in annoying tasks in the PVWA :* [Accounts manipulation](https://aiobastion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/accounts.html)* [Safe manipulation](https://aiobastion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/safe.html)* [User manipulation](https://aiobastion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users.html)* Check the documentation for more## DocumentationThe documention is hosted on readthedocs : https://aiobastion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html## RationaleI've been working on Cyberark projects for years and I see everywhere a profusion of scripts, very often complicated and long to execute for very simple tasks (sometimes even with a &quot;do not turn off&quot; post-it on the screen).This package makes it quick and easy to accomplish without having to deal with the specifics of the Cyberark API.The acquisition time may be longer than for other well-known libraries, but, believe me, you will save this time very quickly.</longdescription>
