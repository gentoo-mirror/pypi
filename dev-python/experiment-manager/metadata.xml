Licensed under`Apache v2 License`_.Experiment Manager==================The SoftFIRE Experiment Manager is the main component of the SoftFIREmiddleware. Other managers can register to the experiment manager sothat the Experiment Manager is able to redirect requests from theexperimenter to the appropriate manager. The managers use the gRPCprotocol for communication.The main tasks of the Experiment Manager are:-  Exposing an API for the dashboard and the SoftFIRE SDK-  User authentication and authorization-  Resource discovery-  Resource reservation-  Resource provisioning-  Processing the experiment definition-  Providing experiment monitoringIn the figure below you can see the work flow of the Experiment Managerinteracting with the experimenter and other managers.|image0|Technical Requirements----------------------The Experiment Manager requires Python 3.5 or higher.Installation and configuration------------------------------You can install the Experiment Manager using pip:::    pip install experiment-managerand then start it with the ``experiment-manager`` command.Or you can run it from source code by cloning the git repository,installing the dependencies as specified in the `setup.py`_ file andexecuting the *experiment-manager* script.The experiment manager needs a configuration file present at*/etc/softfire/experimen-manager.ini*. An example of the configurationfile can be found `here`_.Issue tracker-------------Issues and bug reports should be posted to the GitHub Issue Tracker ofthis project.What is SoftFIRE?=================SoftFIRE provides a set of technologies for building a federatedexperimental platform aimed at the construction and experimentation ofservices and functionalities built on top of NFV and SDN technologies.The platform is a loose federation of already existing testbed owned andoperated by distinct organizations for purposes of research anddevelopment.SoftFIRE has three main objectives: supporting interoperability,programming and security of the federated testbed. Supporting theprogrammability of the platform is then a major goal and it is the focusof the SoftFIRE’s Second Open Call.Licensing and distribution--------------------------Copyright © [2016-2018] SoftFIRE projectLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the “License”);you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
