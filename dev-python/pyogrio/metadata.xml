	<longdescription># pyogrio - Vectorized spatial vector file format I/O using GDAL/OGRPyogrio provides a[GeoPandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas)-oriented API to OGR vectordata sources, such as ESRI Shapefile, GeoPackage, and GeoJSON. Vector data sourceshave geometries, such as points, lines, or polygons, and associated recordswith potentially many columns worth of data.Pyogrio uses a vectorized approach for reading and writing GeoDataFrames to andfrom OGR vector data sources in order to give you faster interoperability. Ituses pre-compiled bindings for GDAL/OGR so that the performance is primarilylimited by the underlying I/O speed of data source drivers in GDAL/OGR ratherthan multiple steps of converting to and from Python data types within Python.We have seen \&gt;5-10x speedups reading files and \&gt;5-20x speedups writing filescompared to using non-vectorized approaches (Fiona and current I/O support inGeoPandas).You can read these data sources into`GeoDataFrames`, read just the non-geometry columns into Pandas `DataFrames`,or even read non-spatial data sources that exist alongside vector data sources,such as tables in a ESRI File Geodatabase, or antiquated DBF files.Pyogrio also enables you to write `GeoDataFrames` to at least a few differentOGR vector data source formats.Read the documentation for more information:[https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io](https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).WARNING: Pyogrio is still at an early version and the API is subject tosubstantial change. Please see [CHANGES](CHANGES.md).## RequirementsSupports Python 3.8 - 3.11 and GDAL 3.1.x - 3.6.x.Reading to GeoDataFrames requires `geopandas&gt;=0.8` with `pygeos`or `geopandas&gt;=0.12` with `shapely&gt;=2`.Additionally, installing `pyarrow` in combination with GDAL 3.6+ enablesa further speed-up when specifying `use_arrow=True`.## InstallationPyogrio is currently available on[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyogrio)and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyogrio/)for Linux, MacOS, and Windows.Please read the[installation documentation](https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)for more information.## Supported vector formatsPyogrio supports some of the most common vector data source formats (providedthey are also supported by GDAL/OGR), including ESRI Shapefile, GeoPackage,GeoJSON, and FlatGeobuf.Please see the [list of supported formats](https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported_formats.html)for more information.## Getting startedPlease read the [introduction](https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported_formats.html)for more information and examples to get started using Pyogrio.You can also check out the the [API documentation](https://pyogrio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html)for full details on using the API.## CreditsThis project is made possible by the tremendous efforts of the GDAL, Fiona, andGeopandas communities.-   Core I/O methods and supporting functions adapted from [Fiona](https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona)-   Inspired by [Fiona PR](https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/pull/540/files)</longdescription>
