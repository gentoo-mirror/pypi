It shouldwork out of the box on any recently installed *Amazon Linux 2* instance.The easiest way to install the agent is from *[PyPI](https://pypi.org/)* repository:```sudo pip install aws-ssm-tunnel-agent```If `pip` command is not available you can download it straight from GitHub:```sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/ssm-tunnel-agent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mludvig/aws-ssm-tools/master/ssm-tunnel-agentsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ssm-tunnel-agent```Hint: these commands can be *copy &amp; pasted* to an **[ec2-session](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mludvig/aws-ssm-tools)** command prompt :)## Author and LicenseThis script was written by [Michael Ludvig](https://aws.nz/)and is released under [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).</longdescription>
