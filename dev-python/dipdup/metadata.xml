It helps developers focus on business logic instead of writing a boilerplate to store and serve data. DipDup-based indexers are selective, which means only required data is requested. This approach allows to achieve faster indexing times and decreased load on underlying APIs.- **Ready to build your first indexer?** Head to [Quickstart](https://dipdup.io/docs/quickstart).- **Looking for examples?** Check out [Demo Projects](https://dipdup.io/docs/examples/demos) and [Built with DipDup](https://dipdup.io/docs/examples/built-with-dipdup) pages.- **Want to participate?** Vote for [open issues](https://github.com/dipdup-io/dipdup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc), join [discussions](https://github.com/dipdup-io/dipdup/discussions) or [become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/dipdup-io).- **Have a question?** Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/aG8XKuwsQd) or tag @dipdup_io on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dipdup_io).This project is maintained by the [Baking Bad](https://bakingbad.dev/) team.&lt;br&gt;Development is supported by [Tezos Foundation](https://tezos.foundation/) and [OnlyDust](https://www.onlydust.xyz).</longdescription>
