	<longdescription>python-anthemav===============|Build Status| |GitHub release| |PyPI|This is a Python package to interface with`Anthem &lt;http://www.anthemav.com&gt;`__ AVM and MRX receivers andprocessors. It uses the asyncio library to maintain an object-basedconnection to the network port of the receiver with supporting methodsand properties to poll and adjust the receiver settings.This package was created primarily to support an anthemav media_playerplatform for the `Home Assistant &lt;https://home-assistant.io/&gt;`__automation platform but it is structured to be general-purpose andshould be usable for other applications as well.Important~~~~~~~~~This package will maintain a persistant connection to the networkcontrol port which will prevent any other application from communicatingwith the receiver. This includes the Anthem iOS and Android remotecontrol app as well as the ARC-2 room calibration software. You willneed to disable any application that is using the library in order torun those other applications.Requirements-------------  Python 3.6 or newer with asyncio-  An Anthem MRX or AVM receiver or processorKnown Issues-------------  This has only been tested with an MRXx20 series receiver, although   the Anthem protocol was largely unchanged from the MRXx10 series. It   should work with the older units, but I’d appreciate feedback or pull   requests if you encounter problems. It will definitely not work with   the original MRXx00 units or the D2v models.-  Only Zone 1 is currently supported. If you have other zones   configured, this library will not allow you to inspect or control   them. This is not an intractable problem, I just chose not to address   that nuance in this initial release. It’s certainly feasible to add   support but I am not settled on how that should be exposed in the   internal API of the package.-  I skipped over a lot of the more esoteric settings that are available   (like toggling Dolby Volume on each input). If I passed over a   setting that’s really important to you, please let me know and I’ll   be happy to add support for it. Eventually I intend to cover the full   scope of the Anthem API, but you know how it goes.Installation------------You can, of course, just install the most recent release of this packageusing ``pip``. This will download the more rececnt version from`PyPI &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/anthemav&gt;`__ and install it to yourhost.::   pip install anthemavIf you want to grab the the development code, you can also clone thisgit repository and install from local sources:::   cd python-anthemav   pip install .And, as you probably expect, you can live the developer’s life byworking with the live repo and edit to your heart’s content:::   cd python-anthemav   pip install . -eTesting-------The package installs a command-line tool which will connect to yourreceiver, power it up, and then monitor all activity and changes thattake place. The code for this console monitor is in``anthemav/tools.py`` and you can invoke it by simply running this atthe command line with the appropriate IP and port number that matchesyour receiver and its configured port:::   anthemav_monitor --host 10.0.0.100 --port 14999Helpful Commands----------------::   sudo tcpflow -c port 14999Interesting Links------------------  `Project Home &lt;https://github.com/nugget/python-anthemav&gt;`__-  API Documentation for Anthem Network Protocol (Excel Spreadsheet):   - `MRX-x20 and AVM-60 &lt;https://www.anthemav.com/downloads/MRX-x20-AVM-60-IP-RS-232.xls&gt;`__   - `MRX-x40, AVM-70 and AVM-90 &lt;https://www.anthemav.com/downloads/MRX-x40-AVM-70-90-IP-RS-232-v5.xls&gt;`__   - `MDX-16 and MDX-8 &lt;https://www.anthemav.com/downloads/MDX-IP-RS232.xlsx&gt;`__   -  `Pictures of cats &lt;http://imgur.com/r/cats&gt;`__Credits--------  This package was written by David McNett.   -  https://github.com/nugget   -  https://keybase.io/nugget-  This package is maintained by Alex Henry   - https://github.com/hyralexHow can you help?------------------  First and foremost, you can help by forking this project and coding.   Features, bug fixes, documentation, and sample code will all add   tremendously to the quality of this project.-  If you have a feature you’d love to see added to the project but you   don’t think that you’re able to do the work, I’m someone is probably   happy to perform the directed development in the form of a bug or   feature bounty.-  If you’re anxious for a feature but it’s not actually worth money to   you, please open an issue here on Github describing the problem or   limitation. If you never ask, it’ll never happen-  If you just want to thank me for the work I’ve already done, I’m   happy to accept your thanks, gratitude, pizza, or bitcoin. My bitcoin   wallet address can be on `Keybase &lt;https://keybase.io/nugget&gt;`__ or   you can send me a donation via   `PayPal &lt;https://www.paypal.me/macnugget&gt;`__.-  Or, if you’re not comfortable sending me money directly, I’ll be   nearly as thrilled (really) if you donate to `the   ACLU &lt;https://action.aclu.org/donate-aclu&gt;`__,   `EFF &lt;https://supporters.eff.org/donate/&gt;`__, or   `EPIC &lt;https://epic.org&gt;`__ and let me know that you did... |Build Status| image:: https://github.com/nugget/python-anthemav/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master   :target: https://github.com/nugget/python-anthemav/actions/workflows/build.yml.. |GitHub release| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/release/nugget/python-anthemav.svg   :target: https://github.com/nugget/python-anthemav/releases.. |PyPI| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/anthemav.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/anthemav</longdescription>
