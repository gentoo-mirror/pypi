For example, such combinations are also correct:```python3fake_traffic(country=&quot;TR&quot;, language=&quot;ar-TR&quot;)fake_traffic(country=&quot;US&quot;, language=&quot;he-IL&quot;)fake_traffic(country=&quot;DE&quot;, language=&quot;hi-IN&quot;)```---### Other examplesCountry   | Language  | Function                                     |----------|---------- | ---------------------------------------------|France    | French    | fake_traffic(country=&quot;FR&quot;, language=&quot;fr-FR&quot;) |Germany   | German    | fake_traffic(country=&quot;DE&quot;, language=&quot;de-DE&quot;, category='b') |India     | English   | fake_traffic(country=&quot;IN&quot;, language=&quot;en-IN&quot;, category='all') |India     | Hindi     | fake_traffic(country=&quot;IN&quot;, language=&quot;hi-IN&quot;, max_wait=10) |Russia    | English   | fake_traffic(country=&quot;RU&quot;, language=&quot;en-US&quot;, category='b', threads=3, debug=True) |Russia    | Russian   | fake_traffic(country=&quot;RU&quot;, language=&quot;ru-RU&quot;, min_wait=0.5, max_wait=3, threads=5) |Brazil | Portuguese | fake_traffic(country=&quot;BR&quot;, language=&quot;pt-BR&quot;, category='s', threads=2,  max_wait=60, debug=True) |United Kingdom | English   | fake_traffic(country=&quot;GB&quot;, language=&quot;en-GB&quot;) |United States  | English   | fake_traffic(country=&quot;US&quot;, language=&quot;en-US&quot;, min_wait=60, max_wait=300) |United States  | Hebrew Israel   | fake_traffic(country=&quot;US&quot;, language=&quot;he-IL&quot;) |</longdescription>
