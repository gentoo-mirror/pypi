	<longdescription># Text2Story main packageThe Text2Story main package contains the main classes and methods for the T2S pipeline: from text to formal representation to visualization or other representation.- **Relation to Brat2Viz**The Text2Story package is a generalization of Brat2Viz and should in fact contain all the functionalities and variants of the T2S project output.## Table of Contents1.

[ Windows ](#installationwindows)&lt;a name=&quot;start&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;## 1. Getting StartedThe main goal of the text2story is to extract narrative from raw text. The narrative components comprise events, the participants (or participants) in the events, and the time expressions. *   **Event**: Eventuality that happens or occurs or state or circumstance that is temporally relevant*   **Time**: Temporal expressions that represent units of time.*   **Participants**: Named entities, or participants, that play an important role in the event or state.These elements relate to each other by some relations, like Semantic Role Links and Objectal Links. *  **Objectal Links**: It states how two discourse entities are referentially related to one another. For instance, there is the &quot;identity&quot; objectal link, which links entities that refer to the same referents, and there is the &quot;part of&quot; objectal link, which links a referent that is part of another.*  **Semantic Role Links**: The identification of the way an entity is involved/participates in aneventuality. For instance, there is the &quot;agent&quot; semantic role link, in which an event is linked toa participant that intentionally caused it.A simple code to perform the extraction of the narrative elements, and the two type of relationsdescribed above is like the following.```pythonimport text2story as t2s # Import the packaget2s.load(&quot;en&quot;) # Load the pipelines for the English languagetext = 'On Friday morning, Max Healthcare, which runs 10 private hospitals around Delhi, put out an &quot;SOS&quot; message, saying it had less than an hour\'s supply remaining at two of its sites.

The AnnotatorsAll annotators have the same interface: they implement a function called 'extract_' followed by the name of the particular extraction.E.g., if they are extracting participants, then they implement a function named 'extract_participants', with two arguments: the language of text and the text itself.| Extractions  |           Interface                                      | Supporting tools                                                             ||--------------|             ---                                          |------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| Participant  | extract_participants(lang, text)                         | SPACY,  NLTK , ALLENNLP, BERTNERPT                                           || Timexs       | extract_timexs(lang, text, publication_time)             | PY_HEIDELTIME, TEI2GO (requires the manual installation for each used model) || ObjectalLink | extract_objectal_links(lang, text, publication_time)     | ALLENNLP                                                                     || Event        | extract_events(lang, text, publication_time)             | ALLENNLP                                                                     || SemanticLink | extract_semantic_role_link(lang, text, publication_time) | ALLENNLP                                                                     |To **change some model used in the supported tools**, just go to text2story/annotators/ANNOTATOR_TO_BE_CHANGED and change the model in the file: \_\_init\_\_.py.To **add a new tool**, add a folder to text2story/annotators with the name of the annotator all capitalized (just a convention; useful to avoid name colisions).In that folder, create a file called '\_\_init\_\_.py' and there implement a function load() and the desired extraction functions.The function load() should load the pipeline to some variable defined by you, so that, every time we do an extraction, we don't need to load the pipeline all over again. (Implement it, even if your annotator doesn't load anything. Leave it with an empty body.)In the text2story.annotators.\_\_init\_\_.py file, add a call to the load() function, and to the extract functions.(See the already implemented tools for guidance.)Specifically, for annotators like TEI2GO (detailed in its documentation [here](https://github.com/hmosousa/tei2go#-huggingface-hub)), users need to manually install the required model. For example, if you plan to use the English model, execute the following command before loading it into 'text2story':```pip install https://huggingface.co/hugosousa/en_tei2go/resolve/main/en_tei2go-any-py3-none-any.whl```And it should be done.PS: Don't forget to normalize the labels to our semantic framework!&lt;a name=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;## 4. Installation&lt;a name=&quot;installationlinux&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;### 4.1 Linux / UbuntuThe installation requires graphviz software, the latex suite and the software poppler to convert pdf to png. In Linux, to install these software open a terminal and type the following commands:```sudo apt-get install graphviz libgraphviz-dev texlive-latex-base  texlive-latex-extra poppler-utils```You will need a virtual environment as well. If you do not have venv, you can install it in linux by using the apt-get command or pip command. Next, we demonstrate these two ways of install it.```sudo apt-get install python3-venv``````python3 -m pip install virtualenv```After that, you will be able to create a virtual environment using venv. For instance, using the following command in the prompt line:```$ python3 -m venv venv```Then, activate the virtual environment in the prompt line. Like, the following command:```$ source venv/bin/activate```After that, you are ready to install &lt;a name=&quot;windows&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;### 4.2 WindowsFirst, make sure you have Microsoft C++ Build Tools. Then install graphviz software by download one suitable version in this [link](https://graphviz.org/download/#windows). Next, install the latex-suite like these [tutorial](https://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html#install) explains. Then, install Popple packed for windows, which you download [here](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows).Finally, you can install text2story using pip. If it did not recognize the graphviz installation, then you can use the following command for pip (tested in pip == 21.1.1).```pip install text2story  --global-option=build_ext --global-option=&quot;-IC:\Program Files\Graphviz\include&quot; --global-option=&quot;-LC:\Program Files\Graphviz\lib\&quot;```For newer version of pip (tested in pip == 23.1.2), you can type the following command:```pip install --use-pep517  --config-setting=&quot;--global-option=build_ext&quot;  --config-setting=&quot;--global-option=-IC:\Program Files\Graphviz\include&quot; --config-setting=&quot;--global-option=-LC:\Program Files\Graphviz\lib&quot;```You need to make sure that venv is also installed in your environment. You can do this by using pip in you PowerShell command line (or another similar shell). ```$ python3 -m pip install virtualenv```Next, you will be able to create a virtual environment with the following command.```$ python3 -m venv venv```Then, activate the virtual environment in the prompt line. Like, the following command:```$ python3 -m venv venv```Then, activate the virtual environment in the prompt line. Like, the following command:```$ .\venv\Scripts\activate```</longdescription>
