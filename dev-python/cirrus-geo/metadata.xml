	<longdescription>[![build-status-image]][build-status][![coverage-status-image]][codecov][![pypi-version]][pypi]# CirrusCirrus is a [STAC](https://stacspec.org/)-based processing pipeline.As input, Cirrus takes a GeoJSON FeatureCollection with 1 or more STAC Items(an `ItemCollection` in pystack nomeclature), with a process definition block.That input is called a cirrus `ProcessPayload` (CPP).An input is run through a workflow that generates one or more output STAC Items.These output Items are added to the Cirrus static STAC catalog in S3,and are also broadcast via an SNS topic. Subscrptions to that topic cantriggering additional workflows or external processes, such as for keepinga dynamic STAC catalog up to date (for example,[STAC-server](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-server)).Cirrus workflows range from the simple publishing of unmodified input items tothe complex transformation of input Items and generation of wholly-new outputItems. The current state of CPP processing is tracked in a state databaseto prevent duplicate processing and allow for a user to follow the state of anyinput through the pipeline.![](docs/images/highlevel.png)As shown in this high-level overview of Cirrus, users input data to Cirrusthrough the use of _feeders_. Feeders are simply programs that get/generatesome type of STAC metadata, combine it with processing parameters, and pass itinto Cirrus as a CPP.Because Cirrus output is published via SNS, a Feeder can be configured tosubscribe to that SNS and thus workflows can be chained, such that the outputof one workflow becomes the input to another workflow, createing multiple levelsof products all with published STAC metadata and clear links showing dataprovenance.## Cirrus DevelopmentIf developing new code for cirrus-geo, checkout the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).## Cirrus QuickstartA Cirrus project is managed via the `cirrus` cli tool.Here's everything required to create, modify, and deploy a new project:```# Make a new directory for a project❯ mkdir cirrus-project; cd cirrus-project# Create a python virtual environment for isolation❯ python -m venv .venv# Activate our venv❯ . .venv/bin/activate# Install cirrus-geo❯ pip install cirrus-geo...# Now we should have cirrus on our path❯ cirrusUsage: cirrus [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...  cli for cirrus, a severless STAC-based processing pipelineOptions:  --cirrus-dir DIRECTORY  -v, --verbose           Increase logging level.
