	<longdescription>python-flock============flock.Flock(fd, op)-------------------Flock object uses `fcntl.flock` to lock (resp. unlock)file descriptor (`fd`) with operation (`op`)when entering (resp. leaving) runtime context related to it.File objects providing a `fileno()` method are accepted as well.Operation is one of the following values:     * `LOCK_SH` - acquire a shared lock * `LOCK_EX` - acquire an exclusive lockOperation can also be bitwise ORed with `LOCK_NB`to avoid blocking on lock acquisition.Example:--------    with open('/tmp/file.lock', 'w') as f:        blocking_lock   = flock.Flock(f, flock.LOCK_EX)        noblocking_lock = flock.Flock(f, flock.LOCK_EX|flock.LOCK_NB)        with blocking_lock:            pass # do something here        try:            with noblocking_lock:                pass # do something else here        except BlockingIOError:            pass</longdescription>
