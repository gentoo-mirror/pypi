	<longdescription># Sempler: generate synthetic and realistic semi-synthetic data with known ground truth for causal discovery![Real and semi-synthetic data produced from the Sachs dataset](./docs/marginals.png)[Documentation at https://sempler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]Sempler allows you to generate synthetic data from SCMs and semi-synthetic data with known causal ground truth but distributions closely resembling those of a real data set of choice. It is one of the software contributions of the paper [*&quot;Characterization and Greedy Learning of Gaussian Structural Causal Models under Unknown Interventions&quot;*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14897) by Juan L. Gamella, Armeen Taeb, Christina Heinze-Deml and Peter BÃ¼hlmann. You can find more details in Appendix E of the paper.If you find this code useful, please consider citing:```@article{gamella2022characterization,  title={Characterization and Greedy Learning of Gaussian Structural Causal Models under Unknown Interventions},  author={Gamella, Juan L. and Taeb, Armeen and Heinze-Deml, Christina and B\&quot;uhlmann, Peter},  year={2022}}```## OverviewThe semi-synthetic data generation procedure is implemented in the class `sempler.DRFNet` (see [docs](https://sempler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.)). A detailed explanation of the procedure can be found in Appendix E of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14897).Additionally, you can generate purely synthetic data from general additive-noise models. Two classes are defined for this purpose.- `sempler.ANM` is for general (acyclic) additive noise SCMs. Any assignment function is possible, as are the distributions of the noise terms.- `sempler.LGANM` is for linear Gaussian SCMs. While this is also possible with `sempler.ANM`, this class simplifies the interface and offers the additional functionality of sampling &quot;in the population setting&quot;, i.e. by returning a symbolic gaussian distribution (see `sempler.LGANM.sample` and `sempler.NormalDistribution`).To allow for random generation of SCMs and interventional distributions, the module `sempler.generators` contains functions to sample random DAGs and intervention targets.## InstallationYou can clone this repo or install using pip. To install sempler in its most basic form, i.e. to generate purely synthetic data with `sempler.ANM` and `sempler.LGANM`, simply run```pip install sempler```To install the additional dependencies needed for the semi-synthetic data generation procedure, run```pip install sempler[DRFNet]```which will install sempler with the additional `rpy2` dependency. You will also need:- an `R` installation; you can find an installation guide [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html)- the `R` package `drf`, which you can install by typing `install.packages(&quot;drf&quot;)` in an R terminal### VersioningSempler is still at its infancy and its API is subject to change. Non backward-compatible changes to the API are reflected by a change to the minor or major version number,&gt; e.g. *code written using sempler==0.1.2 will run with sempler==0.1.3, but may not run with sempler==0.2.0.*## DocumentationYou can find the full documentation at https://sempler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.  ## FeedbackFeedback is most welcome!
