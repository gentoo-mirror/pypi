	<longdescription># NEPSE API WrapperThis python module fetches the data from [Nepali Stock Site](https://newweb.nepalstock.com/) and provides them in a pythonicand usable way.## AboutThis is a API wrapper for NEPSE API. This project was inspired from [PyPi Nepse](https://github.com/pyFrappe/nepse). ## DocumentationThere is a detailed guide in my documentation page for getting started and installing.[Documentation](https://nepse-api.readthedocs.io/)## How to use?You can use this by package from [Nepse API PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/nepse-api/)```shpip install nepse-api```## Why use this?How is this better than [PyPi Nepse](https://github.com/pyFrappe/nepse)?- It is asynchronous.- Data can be taken as attributes rather than from dict.- Data is fetched from the API rather than scraping the site.- Data is cached ## APIs usedThe APIs that I used to create this API wrapper is:- https://newweb.nepalstock.com/api/## How to use?```pyimport asyncioimport httpxfrom nepse import Clientasync def main():    company_Symbol = input('Input Company Symbol (Uppercase): ')    # Doing this is optional you can directly    # Initialize using `client = Client()` as well    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as async_client:        # Initializes the client        client = Client(httpx_client=async_client)        # Gets the data        data = await client.security_client.get_company(symbol=f&quot;{company_Symbol}&quot;)        # Prints the highest price for that company today        print(f'High Price of {company_Symbol}: ', data.high_price)        print(f'Low price of {company_Symbol}: ', data.low_price)        print(f'Open Price of {company_Symbol}: ', data.open_price)# Run the functionloop = asyncio.get_event_loop()loop.run_until_complete(main())```## Why are the attributes so in-costistent?The attribues are in-consistent because the attributes are set according to the response set by the API. I tried changing it up but that would be distruptive because the comability with the API would be broken. ## Want To Contribute?You can send a pull request or open an issue to contribute.Check out [Code Of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.</longdescription>
