Generous contributions by educators and institutions aremaking excellent education available to many who could not afford it otherwise.There are even non-profits with &quot;feet on the ground&quot; in remote areas of theworld who are helping spread the wealth (see the feedback below from [Tunapanda][14]).This script makes it easier to batch download lecture resources (e.g., videos, ppt,etc) for Coursera classes.  Given one or more class names and account credentials,it obtains week and class names from the *lectures* page, and then downloadsthe related materials into appropriately named files and directories.Why is this helpful?  A utility like [wget][2] can work, but has thefollowing limitations:1. Video names have numbers in them, but this does not correspond to    the actual order.  Manually renaming them is a pain that is best left    for computers.2. Using names from the syllabus page provides more informative names.3. Using `wget` in a for loop picks up extra videos which are not    posted/linked, and these are sometimes duplicates.Browser extensions like *DownloadThemAll* is another possibility, but`coursera-dl` provides more features such as appropriately named files.This work was originally inspired in part by [youtube-dl][3] by whichI've downloaded many other good videos such as those from Khan Academy.# Features  * Support for all kinds of courses (i.e., &quot;Old Platform&quot;/time-based as    well as &quot;New Platform&quot;/on-demand courses).  * Intentionally detailed names, so that it will display and sort properly    on most interfaces (e.g., [VLC][4] or MX Video on Android devices).  * Regex-based section (week) and lecture name filters to download only    certain resources.  * File format extension filter to grab resource types you want.  * Login credentials accepted on command-line or from `.netrc` file.  * Default arguments loaded from `coursera-dl.conf` file.  * Core functionality tested on Linux, Mac and Windows.# Disclaimer`coursera-dl` is meant to be used only for your material that Coursera givesyou access to download.We do not encourage any use that violates their [Terms Of Use][20]. Arelevant excerpt:&gt; &quot;[...] Coursera grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable&gt; license to access and use the Sites. You may download material from the&gt; Sites only for your own personal, non-commercial use. You may not&gt; otherwise copy, reproduce, retransmit, distribute, publish, commercially&gt; exploit or otherwise transfer any material, nor may you modify or create&gt; derivatives works of the material.&quot;# Installation instructions`coursera-dl` requires Python 2 or Python 3 and a free Coursera accountenrolled in the class of interest. (As of February of 2016, we testautomatically the execution of the program with Python versions 2.6, 2.7,Pypy, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6).**Note:** We *strongly* recommend that you use a Python 3 interpreter (3.4or later).On any operating system, ensure that the Python executable location is addedto your `PATH` environment variable and, once you have the dependenciesinstalled (see next section), for a *basic* usage, you will need to invokethe script from the main directory of the project and prepend it with theword `python`.  You can also use more advanced features of the program bylooking at the &quot;Running the script&quot; section of this document.*Note:* You must already have (manually) agreed to the Honor of Code of theparticular courses that you want to use with `coursera-dl`.## Recommended installation method for all Operating SystemsFrom a command line (preferably, from a virtual environment), simply issuethe command:    pip install coursera-dlThis will download [the latest released version][23] of the program from the[Python Package Index (PyPI)][22] along with *all* the necessarydependencies. At this point, you should be ready to start using it.If this does not work, because your Python 2 version is too old (e.g. 2.7.5on Ubuntu 14.4), try:    apt-get install python3 python3-pip    pip3 install coursera-dlinstead.**Note 1:** We strongly recommend that you *don't* install the packageglobally on your machine (i.e., with root/administrator privileges), as theinstalled modules may conflict with other Python applications that you haveinstalled in your system (or they can interfere with `coursera-dl`).  Preferto use the option `--user` to `pip install`, if you need can.**Note 2:** As already mentioned, we *strongly* recommend that you use a newPython 3 interpreter (e.g., 3.4 or later), since Python 3 has better supportfor SSL/TLS (for secure connections) than earlier versions.&lt;br/&gt;If you must use Python 2, be sure that you have at least Python 2.7.9 (laterversions are OK).&lt;br/&gt;Otherwise, you can still use `coursera-dl`, but you will have to install theextra package `ndg-httpsclient`, which may involve compilation (at least onLinux systems).## Alternative ways of installing missing dependenciesWe strongly recommend that you consider installing Python packages with[pip][17], as in it is the current [preferred method][18], unless directedotherwise by one of the project members (for instance, when testing ordebugging a new feature or using the source code directly from our gitrepository).  If you are using `pip`, you can directly install all thedependencies from the requirements file using `pip install -rrequirements.txt`.### Alternative installation method for Unix systemsWe strongly recommend that you install `coursera-dl` and all itsdependencies in a way that does *not* interfere with the rest of your Pythoninstallation. This is accomplished by the creation of a *virtualenvironment*, or &quot;virtualenv&quot;.For the initial setup, in a Unix-like operating system, please use thefollowing steps (create/adapt first the directory`/directory/where/I/want/my/courses`):    cd /directory/where/I/want/my/courses    virtualenv my-coursera    cd my-coursera    source bin/activate    git clone https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl    cd coursera-dl    pip install -r requirements.txt    ./coursera-dl ...To further download new videos from your classes, simply perform:    cd /directory/where/I/want/my/courses/my-coursera    source bin/activate    cd coursera-dl    ./coursera-dl ...We are working on streamlining this whole process so that it is as simple aspossible, but to support older versions of Python and to cope with Courseradisabling SSLv3, we have to take a few extra steps.  In any case, it is*highly* recommended that you always install the latest version of thePython interpreter that you can.### ArchLinuxAUR package: [coursera-dl](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/coursera-dl/)### Installing dependencies on your own**Warning:** This method is not recommended unless you have experienceworking with multiple Python environments.You can use the `pip` program to install the dependencies on your own.  Theyare all listed in the `requirements.txt` file (and the extra dependenciesneeded for development are listed in the `requirements-dev.txt` file).To use this method, you would proceed as:    pip install -r requirements.txt    pip install -r requirements-dev.txtThe second line above should only be needed if you intend to help withdevelopment (and help is *always* welcome) or if a maintainer of the projectasks you to install extra packages for debugging purposes.Once again, before filing bug reports, if you installed the dependencies onyour own, please check that the versions of your modules are at least thoselisted in the `requirements.txt` file (and, `requirements-dev.txt` file, ifapplicable).## DockerIf you prefer you can run this software inside Docker:```docker run --rm -it -v \    &quot;$(pwd):/courses&quot; \    courseradl/courseradl -u &lt;USER&gt; -p &lt;PASSWORD&gt;```Or using netrc file:```docker run --rm -it \    -v &quot;$(pwd):/courses&quot; -v &quot;$HOME/.netrc:/netrc&quot; \    courseradl/courseradl -n /netrc```The actual working dir for coursera-dl is /courses, all courses will bedownloaded there if you don't specify otherwise.## Windows`python -m pip install coursera-dl`Be sure that the Python install path is added to the PATH system environmentvariables. This can be found in Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Advanced SystemSettings &gt; Environment Variables.```Example:C:\Python35\Scripts\;C:\Python35\;```Or if you have restricted installation permissions and you've installed Pythonunder AppData, add this to your PATH.```Example:C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\Scripts;C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32;```Coursera-dl can now be run from commandline or powershell.## Create an account with CourseraIf you don't already have one, create a [Coursera][1] account and enroll ina class. See https://www.coursera.org/courses for the list of classes.## Running the scriptRun the script to download the materials by providing your Coursera accountcredentials (e.g. email address and password or a `~/.netrc` file), theclass names, as well as any additional parameters:    General:                     coursera-dl -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;pass&gt; modelthinking-004    With CAUTH parameter: coursera-dl -ca 'some-ca-value-from-browser' modelthinking-004If you don't want to type your password in command line as plain text, you can use the script without `-p` option. In this case you will be prompted for password  once the script is run.    Without -p field:            coursera-dl -u &lt;user&gt; modelthinking-004    Multiple classes:            coursera-dl -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;pass&gt; saas historyofrock1-001 algo-2012-002    Filter by section name:      coursera-dl -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;pass&gt; -sf &quot;Chapter_Four&quot; crypto-004    Filter by lecture name:      coursera-dl -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;pass&gt; -lf &quot;3.1_&quot; ml-2012-002    Download only ppt files:     coursera-dl -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;pass&gt; -f &quot;ppt&quot; qcomp-2012-001    Use a ~/.netrc file:         coursera-dl -n -- matrix-001    Get the preview classes:     coursera-dl -n -b ni-001    Specify download path:       coursera-dl -n --path=C:\Coursera\Classes\ comnetworks-002    Display help:                coursera-dl --help    Maintain a list of classes in a dir:      Initialize:              mkdir -p CURRENT/{class1,class2,..classN}      Update:                  coursera-dl -n --path CURRENT `\ls CURRENT`**Note:** If your `ls` command is aliased to display a colorized output, youmay experience problems.  Be sure to escape the `ls` command (use `\ls`) toassure that no special characters get sent to the script.Note that we *do* support the New Platform (&quot;on-demand&quot;) classes.On \*nix platforms, the use of a `~/.netrc` file is a good alternative tospecifying both your username (i.e., your email address) and password everytime on the command line. To use it, simply add a line like the one below toa file named `.netrc` in your home directory (or the [equivalent][8], if youare using Windows) with contents like:    machine coursera-dl login &lt;user&gt; password &lt;pass&gt;Create the file if it doesn't exist yet.  From then on, you can switch fromusing `-u` and `-p` to simply call `coursera-dl` with the option `-n`instead.  This is especially convenient, as typing usernames (emailaddresses) and passwords directly on the command line can get tiresome (evenmore if you happened to choose a &quot;strong&quot; password).Alternatively, if you want to store your preferred parameters (which mightalso include your username and password), create a file named `coursera-dl.conf`where the script is supposed to be executed, with the following format:    --username &lt;user&gt;    --password &lt;pass&gt;    --subtitle-language en,zh-CN|zh-TW    --download-quizzes    #--mathjax-cdn https://cdn.bootcss.com/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js    # more other parametersParameter which is stored in the file will be overriden if it is again specifiedin your commandline script**Note:** In `coursera-dl.conf`, all the parameters should not be wrappedwith quotes.## Resuming downloadsIn default mode when you interrupt the download process by pressing&lt;kbd&gt;CTRL&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;C&lt;/kbd&gt;, partially downloaded files will be deleted from your disk andyou have to start the download process from the beginning. If yourdownload was interrupted by something other than KeyboardInterrupt(&lt;kbd&gt;CTRL&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;C&lt;/kbd&gt;) like sudden system crash, partially downloaded files willremain on your disk and the next time you start the process again,these files will be discarded from download list!, therefore it's yourjob to delete them manually before next start. For this reason weadded an option called `--resume` which continues your downloads fromwhere they stopped:coursera-dl -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;pass&gt; --resume sdn1-001This option can also be used with external downloaders:coursera-dl --wget -u &lt;user&gt; -p &lt;pass&gt; --resume sdn1-001*Note 1*: Some external downloaders use their own built-in resume featurewhich may not be compatible with others, so use them at your own risk.*Note 2*: Remember that in resume mode, interrupted files **WON'T** be deleted fromyour disk.**NOTE**: If your password contains punctuation, quotes or other &quot;funnycharacters&quot; (e.g., `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `#`, `&amp;`, `|` and so on), then you may have toescape them from your shell. With bash or other Bourne-shell clones (andprobably with many other shells) one of the better ways to do so is toenclose your password in single quotes, so that you don't run intoproblems.  See [issue #213][issue213] for more information.# TroubleshootingIf you have problems when downloading class materials, please try to see ifone of the following actions solve your problem:* Make sure the class name you are using corresponds to the resource name  used in the URL for that class:    `https://www.coursera.org/learn/&lt;CLASS_NAME&gt;/home/welcome`* Have you tried to clean the cached cookies/credentials with the  `--clear-cache` option?* Note that many courses (most, perhaps?) may remove the materials after a  little while after the course is completed, while other courses may retain  the materials up to a next session/offering of the same course (to avoid  problems with academic dishonesty, apparently).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  In short, it is not guaranteed that you will be able to download after the  course is finished and this is, unfortunately, nothing that we can help  you with.* Make sure you have installed and/or updated all of your dependencies  according to the `requirements.txt` file as described above.* One can export a Netscape-style cookies file with a browser extension ([1][9], [2][10])  and use it with the `-c` option. This comes in handy  when the authentication via password is not working (the authentication  process changes now and then).* If results show 0 sections, you most likely have provided invalid  credentials (username and/or password in the command line or in your  `.netrc` file or in your `coursera-dl.conf` file).* For courses that have not started yet, but have had a previous iteration  sometimes a preview is available, containing all the classes from the last  course. These files can be downloaded by passing the `--preview`  parameter.* If you get an error like `Could not find class: &lt;CLASS_NAME&gt;`, then:    * Verify that the name of the course is correct. Current class    names in coursera are composed by a short course name e.g. `class` and    the current version of the course (a number). For example, for a    class named `class`, you would have to use `class-001`, `class-002`    etc.    * Second, verify that you are enrolled in the course. You won't be    able to access the course materials if you are not officially    enrolled and agreed to the honor course *via the website*.* If:    * You get an error when using `-n` to specify that you want to use a      `.netrc` file and,    * You want the script to use your default netrc file and,    * You get a message saying `coursera-dl: error: too few arguments`      Then you should specify `--` as an argument after `-n`, that is, `-n --`      or change the order in which you pass the arguments to the script, so that      the argument after `-n` begins with an hyphen (`-`).  Otherwise, Python's      `argparse` module will think that what you are passing is the name of the      netrc file that you want to use. See issue #162.* If your password has spaces, don't forget to write it using quotes.* Have you installed the right project ?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  **Warning**: If you installed the script using PyPi (pip) please verify that  you installed the correct project. We had to use a different name in pip  because our original name was already taken. Remember to install it using:  ```      pip install coursera-dl  ```## China issuesIf you are from China and you're having problems downloading videos,adding &quot;52.84.167.78 d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net&quot; in the hosts file(/etc/hosts) and freshing DNS with &quot;ipconfig/flushdns&quot; may work(see https://github.com/googlehosts/hosts for more info).## Found 0 sections and 0 lectures on this pageFirst of all, make sure you are enrolled to the course you want to download.Many old courses have already closed enrollment so often it's not anoption. In this case, try downloading with `--preview` option. Somecourses allow to download lecture materials without enrolling, butit's not common and is not guaranteed to work for every course.Finally, you can download the videos if you have, at least, the indexfile that lists all the course materials. Maybe your friend who is enrolledcould save that course page for you. In that case use the `--process_local_page`option.Alternatively you may want to try this Chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coursera-materials-downlo/ijkboagofaehocnjacacdhdcbbcpilihIf none of the above works for you, there is nothing we can do.## Download timeoutsCoursera-dl supports external downloaders but note that they are only used todownload materials after the syllabus has been parsed, e.g. videos, PDFs, somehandouts and additional files (syllabus is always downloaded using the internaldownloader). If you experience problems with downloading such materials, you maywant to start using external downloader and configure its timeout values. Forexample, you can use aria2c downloader by passing `--aria` option:```coursera-dl -n --path . --aria2  &lt;course-name&gt;```And put this into aria2c's configuration file `~/.aria2/aria2.conf` to reducetimeouts:```connect-timeout=2timeout=2bt-stop-timeout=1```Timeout configuration for internal downloader is not supported.## Windows: proxy supportIf you're on Windows behind a proxy, set up the environment variablesbefore running the script as follows:```set HTTP_PROXY=http://host:portset HTTPS_PROXY=http://host:port```Related discussion: [#205](https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl/issues/205)## Windows: Failed to create processIn `C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\Scripts`or wherever Python installed (above is default for Windows)edit below file in idle: (right click on script name and select 'edit with idle in menu)```coursera-dl-script```from```#!c:\users\&lt;user&gt;\appdata\local\programs\python\python35-32\python.exe```to```#&quot;!c:\users\&lt;user&gt;\appdata\local\programs\python\python35-32\python.exe&quot;```(add quotes). This is a known pip bug.Source: [issue #500][issue500] [StackOverflow][pipinstallerbug]## SSLError: [Errno 1] _ssl.c:504: error:14094410:SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:sslv3 alert handshake failureThis is a known error, please do not report about this error message! The problem is in **YOUR** environment. To fix it, do the following:``` bashsudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev libssl-dev libffi-devpip install --user urllib3 pyasn1 ndg-httpsclient pyOpenSSL```If the error remains, try installing coursera-dl from github following this instruction:https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl#alternative-installation-method-for-unix-systemsIf you still have the problem, please read the following issues for more ideas on how to fix it:[#330](https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl/issues/330)[#377](https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl/issues/377)[#329](https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl/issues/329)This is also worth reading:https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html#insecureplatformwarning## Alternative CDN for `MathJax.js`When saving a course page, we enabled `MathJax` rendering for math equations, byinjecting `MathJax.js` in the header. The script is using a cdn service providedby [mathjax.org](https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js). However, thaturl is not accessible in some countries/regions, you can provide a`--mathjax-cdn &lt;MATHJAX_CDN&gt;` parameter to specify the `MathJax.js` file that isaccessible in your region.# Reporting issuesBefore reporting any issue please follow the steps below:1. Verify that you are running the latest version of the script, and therecommended versions of its dependencies, see them in the file`requirements.txt`.  Use the following command if in doubt:        pip install --upgrade coursera-dl2. If the problem persists, feel free to [open an issue][issue] in ourbugtracker, please fill the issue template with *as much information aspossible*.[issue]: https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl/issues# Filing an issue/Reporting a bugWhen reporting bugs against `coursera-dl`, please don't forget to includeenough information so that you can help us help you:* Is the problem happening with the latest version of the script?* What operating system are you using?* Do you have all the recommended versions of the modules? See them in the  file `requirements.txt`.* What is the course that you are trying to access?* What is the precise command line that you are using (feel free to hide  your username and password with asterisks, but leave all other  information untouched).* What are the precise messages that you get? Please, use the `--debug`  option before posting the messages as a bug report. Please, copy and paste  them.  Don't reword/paraphrase the messages.# FeedbackI enjoy getting feedback. Here are a few of the comments I've received:* &quot;Thanks for the good job! Knowledge will flood the World a little more thanks  to your script!&quot;  &lt;br&gt;Guillaume V. 11/8/2012* &quot;Just wanted to send you props for your Python script to download Coursera  courses. I've been using it in Kenya for my non-profit to get online courses  to places where internet is really expensive and unreliable. Mostly kids here  can't afford high school, and downloading one of these classes by the usual  means would cost more than the average family earns in one week. Thanks!&quot;  &lt;br&gt;Jay L., [Tunapanda][14] 3/20/2013* &quot;I am a big fan of Coursera and attend lots of different courses. Time  constraints don't allow me to attend all the courses I want at the same time.  I came across your script, and I am very happily using it!  Great stuff and  thanks for making this available on Github - well done!&quot;  &lt;br&gt;William G.  2/18/2013* &quot;This script is awesome! I was painstakingly downloading each and every video  and ppt by hand -- looked into wget but ran into wildcard issues with HTML,  and then.. I came across your script.  Can't tell you how many hours you've  just saved me :) If you're ever in Paris / Stockholm, it is absolutely  mandatory that I buy you a beer :)&quot;  &lt;br&gt;Razvan T. 11/26/2012* &quot;Thanks a lot! :)&quot;  &lt;br&gt;Viktor V. 24/04/2013# ContactPlease, post bugs and issues on [github][11].
