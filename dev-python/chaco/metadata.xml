	<longdescription>=========================================chaco: interactive 2-dimensional plotting=========================================http://www.github.com/enthought/chacohttp://docs.enthought.com/chacoChaco is a Python plotting application toolkit that facilitates writingplotting applications at all levels of complexity, from simple scripts withhard-coded data to large plotting programs with complex data interrelationshipsand a multitude of interactive tools. While Chaco generates attractive staticplots for publication and presentation, it also works well for interactive datavisualization and exploration.Features--------- **Flexible drawing and layout**: Plots consist of graphical components which  can be placed inside nestable containers for layout, positioning, and event  dispatch. Every component has a configurable rendering loop with distinct  layers and backbuffering. Containers can draw cooperatively so that layers  span across the containment hierarchy.- **Modular and extensible architecture**: Chaco is object-oriented from the  ground up for ease of extension and customization. There are clear interfaces  and abstract classes defining extension points for writing your own custom  behaviors, from custom tools, plot types, layouts, etc. Most classes are  also &quot;subclass-friendly&quot;, so that subclasses can override one or two methods  and everything else just works.- **Data model for ease of extension and embedding**: Chaco separates the data  from any transformations of the data that are needed for displaying it. This  separation makes it easier to extend Chaco, or embed it in applications.Prerequisites-------------Chaco is only supported on Python &gt;= 3.6.You must have the following libraries installed before building or installingChaco:* `Numpy &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy&gt;`_* `setuptools &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools&gt;`_* `Cython &lt;https://cython.org/&gt;`_* `enable &lt;https://github.com/enthought/enable&gt;`_Mailing list------------To monitor discussions about Chaco, as well as the rest of the`Enthought Tool Suite &lt;https://docs.enthought.com/ets&gt;`_ (Traits, TraitsUI,Chaco, Mayavi, ...), please refer to the `ets-users``google group &lt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ets-users&gt;`_ .</longdescription>
