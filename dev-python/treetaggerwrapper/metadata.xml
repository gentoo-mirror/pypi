	<longdescription>Python wrapper for TreeTagger=============================.. note:    TreeTagger is a language independent part-of-speech tagger.:author: Laurent Pointal &lt;laurent.pointal@limsi.fr&gt; &lt;laurent.pointal@laposte.net&gt;:organization: CNRS - LIMSI:copyright: CNRS - 2004-2019:license: GNU-GPL Version 3 or greater:version: 2.3- `Module documentation &lt;http://treetaggerwrapper.readthedocs.org/&gt;`_  (on Read The Docs).- `Subversion repository &amp; bug tracking &lt;https://sourcesup.renater.fr/scm/viewvc.php?root=ttpw&gt;`_  (on french academic SourceSup site).- `Developer page &lt;https://perso.limsi.fr/pointal/dev:treetaggerwrapper&gt;`_What is it?-----------This module wrap the Helmut Schmid language independent part-of-speechstatistical tagger into a Python class allowing to tagseveral texts one after the other, maintaining connexions with the taggerprocess to speed-up processing (remove external Perl scripts dependencyfor chunking).Using objects, you can start multiple taggers simultaneously, eventually usingdifferent languages.Support chunking for:- english- french- german- spanishSupport tagging for languages supported by TreeTagger, but you have todo chunking by your own, if necessary you have to specify parameterfiles via options.This version has been reworked to run with Python2 and Python3 (thanks so six)and globally reworked, bugs fixed.Installation------------Unless someone built a package for your OS distro, the simplest procedureis to use ``pip`` to install the module:    pip install treetaggerwrapperIf you have no admin access to install things on you computer, you may installa virtualenv and run pip inside this virtual env, or you can do a local userinstallation:    pip install --user treetaggerwrapperMay use ``pip3`` to go with your Python3 installation.You also need to install TreeTaggerâ€¦TreeTagger----------Treetagger itself is is freely available for research, education and evaluation.See `TreeTagger page`_... _TreeTagger page: http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/DecisionTreeTagger.htmlThere is an installation procedure based on a script, where you download needed filesinto the directory where you want to install TreeTagger, including the installationscript, and then launch the script to unzip and install right files in rightdirectories with right names.For *Windows* users, there is a downloadable Windows binary, but no install script.You have to download TreeTagger parameter files (since TreeTagger goes utf-8 theyare same on Linux and Windows), unzip them and install them in the rightplace (``lib/``), with the right names (you can see these files names in``treetaggerwrapper.py`` global dictionnary ``g_langsupport``,in keys ``tagparfile`` and ``abbrevfile``.If you install TreeTagger in a common place, there is normally a working autodetectionwithin ``treetaggerwrapper``.But if you install it in a special place or with a special name, you will haveto provide this installation directory to the module (see ``TAGDIR`` in the doc).</longdescription>
