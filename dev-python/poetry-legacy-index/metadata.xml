	<longdescription># Poetry Legacy Index FixThis project is a poetry plugin that has one simple purpose:**Patch poetry (Legacy) Repository to download wheels associated with the given platform.**## Why?Long story short, TensorFlow 2.11.x includes different metadata per platform wheel, and poetry simply downloads the first wheel found in a legacy index (e.g. devpi, pypiserver), which causes it to incorrectly resolve the dependencies.Another nice side effect is that ([based on a discussion on the poetry repo][poetry-issue-4000]) poetry doesn't cache the downloaded wheels at the &quot;solving&quot; phase, which means that if the first wheel downloaded is not the one that will be installed, it will be downloaded again and again each time (~500 MB for TensorFlow). By downloading the wheel for the given platform, it will *at least* check the cache before attempting to download the wheel, and the wheel should be available if it was already downloaded for installation.[poetry-issue-4000]: https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4000</longdescription>
