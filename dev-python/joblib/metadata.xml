See the  instructions in the `Building the docs`_ section for details.Workflow to contribute======================To contribute to joblib, first create an account on `github&lt;http://github.com/&gt;`_. Once this is done, fork the `joblib repository&lt;http://github.com/joblib/joblib&gt;`_ to have your own repository,clone it using 'git clone' on the computers where you want to work. Makeyour changes in your clone, push them to your github account, test themon several computers, and when you are happy with them, send a pullrequest to the main repository.Running the test suite======================To run the test suite, you need the pytest (version &gt;= 3) and coverage modules.Run the test suite using::    pytest joblibfrom the root of the project.Building the docs=================To build the docs you need to have sphinx (&gt;=1.4) and some dependenciesinstalled::    pip install -U -r .readthedocs-requirements.txtThe docs can then be built with the following command::    make docThe html docs are located in the ``doc/_build/html`` directory.Making a source tarball=======================To create a source tarball, eg for packaging or distributing, run thefollowing command::    python setup.py sdistThe tarball will be created in the `dist` directory. This command willcompile the docs, and the resulting tarball can be installed withno extra dependencies than the Python standard library. You will needsetuptool and sphinx.Making a release and uploading it to PyPI=========================================This command is only run by project manager, to make a release, andupload in to PyPI::    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel    twine upload dist/*Note that the documentation should automatically get updated at each gitpush. If that is not the case, try building th doc locally and resolveany doc build error (in particular when running the examples).Updating the changelog======================Changes are listed in the CHANGES.rst file. They must be manually updatedbut, the following git command may be used to generate the lines::    git log --abbrev-commit --date=short --no-merges --sparse</longdescription>
