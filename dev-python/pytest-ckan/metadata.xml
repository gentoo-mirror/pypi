	<longdescription>CKAN 2.8 Pytest Plugin and Fixtures===================================This project backports the `pytest` environment for CKAN from CKAN 2.9 to CKAN2.8. This allows CKAN extension developers to test CKAN plugins built to work with CKAN 2.8 as well as CKAN 2.9 or newer using a single unified testsuite. Installation &amp; Usage--------------------To use this in your project: * Add this library to your CKAN plugin project * Write your tests with pytest (you can use CKAN fixtures as described below) * Run `pytest` * When tested with CKAN 2.9 or newer, CKAN's built-in pytest plugin and fixtures    will be used * When tested with older versions of CKAN, the code in `pytest_ckan` will   be used instead### Adding to CKAN projectTo use this plugin to test your CKAN extension, simply install this library toyour development / testing environment:    pip install pytest-ckanIf you maintain a `dev-requirements.txt` or `test-requirements.txt` file you can add this library to it. ### Running PytestTo enable CKAN testing, simply add `--ckan-ini=&lt;path/to/test.ini&gt;` to your `pytest` command, for example:```bashpytest --ckan-ini=test.ini ckanext/yourextension/tests```### Using CKAN Fixtures and Markers in TestsTBD; For now, see [CKAN 2.9's extension testing guide](https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/extensions/testing-extensions.html)for some examples.
