Set thresholds       as you see fit.     Example script:     .. code-block:: python            from pylinac import LeedsTOR, StandardImagingQC3, LasVegas, DoselabMC2kV, DoselabMC2MV            leeds = LeedsTOR(&quot;my_leeds.dcm&quot;)            leeds.analyze()            leeds.plot_analyzed_image()            leeds.publish_pdf()            qc3 = StandardImagingQC3(&quot;my_qc3.dcm&quot;)            qc3.analyze()            qc3.plot_analyzed_image()            qc3.publish_pdf(&quot;qc3.pdf&quot;)            lv = LasVegas(&quot;my_lv.dcm&quot;)            lv.analyze()            lv.plot_analyzed_image()            lv.publish_pdf(&quot;lv.pdf&quot;, open_file=True)  # open the PDF after publishing            ...* `Winston-Lutz Analysis &lt;http://pylinac.readthedocs.org/en/stable/winston_lutz.html&gt;`_ -    The Winston-Lutz module analyzes EPID images taken of a small radiation field and BB to determine the 2D    distance from BB to field CAX. Additionally, the isocenter size of the gantry, collimator, and couch can    all be determined *without the BB being at isocenter*. Analysis is based on    `Winkler et al &lt;http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9155/48/9/303/meta;jsessionid=269700F201744D2EAB897C14D1F4E7B3.c2.iopscience.cld.iop.org&gt;`_    , `Du et al &lt;http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapm/journal/medphys/37/5/10.1118/1.3397452&gt;`_, and    `Low et al &lt;https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1118/1.597475&gt;`_.    Features:    * **Couch shift instructions** - After running a WL test, get immediate feedback on how to shift the couch.      Couch values can also be passed in and the new couch values will be presented so you don't have to do that pesky conversion.      &quot;Do I subtract that number or add it?&quot;    * **Automatic field &amp; BB positioning** - When an image or directory is loaded, the field CAX and the BB      are automatically found, along with the vector and scalar distance between them.    * **Isocenter size determination** - Using backprojections of the EPID images, the 3D gantry isocenter size      and position can be determined *independent of the BB position*. Additionally, the 2D planar isocenter size      of the collimator and couch can also be determined.    * **Image plotting** - WL images can be plotted separately or together, each of which shows the field CAX, BB and      scalar distance from BB to CAX.    * **Axis deviation plots** - Plot the variation of the gantry, collimator, couch, and EPID in each plane      as well as RMS variation.    * **File name interpretation** - Rename DICOM filenames to include axis information for linacs that don't include      such information in the DICOM tags. E.g. &quot;myWL_gantry45_coll0_couch315.dcm&quot;.    Example script:    .. code-block:: python        from pylinac import WinstonLutz        wl = WinstonLutz(&quot;wl/image/directory&quot;)  # images are analyzed upon loading        wl.plot_summary()        print(wl.results())        wl.publish_pdf(&quot;my_wl.pdf&quot;)* `Starshot Analysis &lt;http://pylinac.readthedocs.org/en/stable/starshot_docs.html&gt;`_ -    The Starshot module analyses a starshot image made of radiation spokes, whether gantry, collimator, MLC or couch.    It is based on ideas from `Depuydt et al &lt;http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9155/57/10/2997&gt;`_    and `Gonzalez et al &lt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1118/1.1755491&gt;`_.    Features:    * **Analyze scanned film images, single EPID images, or a set of EPID images** -      Any image that you can load in can be analyzed, including 1 or a set of EPID DICOM images and      films that have been digitally scanned.    * **Any image size** - Have machines with different EPIDs? Scanned your film at different resolutions? No problem.    * **Dose/OD can be inverted** - Whether your device/image views dose as an increase in value or a decrease, pylinac      will detect it and invert if necessary.    * **Automatic noise detection &amp; correction** - Sometimes there's dirt on the scanned film; sometimes there's a dead pixel on the EPID.      Pylinac will detect these spurious noise signals and can avoid or account for them.    * **Accurate, FWHM star line detection** - Pylinac uses not simply the maximum value to find the center of a star line,      but analyzes the entire star profile to determine the center of the FWHM, ensuring small noise or maximum value bias is avoided.    * **Adaptive searching** - If you passed pylinac a set of parameters and a good result wasn't found, pylinac can recover and      do an adaptive search by adjusting parameters to find a &quot;reasonable&quot; wobble.    Example script:    .. code-block:: python        from pylinac import Starshot        star = Starshot(&quot;mystarshot.tif&quot;)        star.analyze(radius=0.75, tolerance=1.0, fwhm=True)        print(star.results())  # prints out wobble information        star.plot_analyzed_image()  # shows a matplotlib figure        star.publish_pdf()  # publish a PDF report* `VMAT QA &lt;http://pylinac.readthedocs.org/en/stable/vmat_docs.html&gt;`_ -    The VMAT module consists of two classes: ``DRGS`` and ``DRMLC``, which are capable of loading an EPID DICOM Open field image and MLC field image and analyzing the    images according to the Varian RapidArc QA tests and procedures, specifically the Dose-Rate &amp; Gantry-Speed (DRGS) and MLC speed (MLCS) tests.    Features:    * **Do both tests** - Pylinac can handle either DRGS or DRMLC tests.    * **Adjust for offsets** - Older VMAT patterns were off-center. Pylinac will find the field regardless.    Example script:    .. code-block:: python        from pylinac import DRGS, DRMLC        drgs = DRGS(image_paths=[&quot;path/to/DRGSopen.dcm&quot;, &quot;path/to/DRGSdmlc.dcm&quot;])        drgs.analyze(tolerance=1.5)        print(drgs.results())  # prints out ROI information        drgs.plot_analyzed_image()  # shows a matplotlib figure        drgs.publish_pdf(&quot;mydrgs.pdf&quot;)  # generate a PDF report* `CatPhan, Quart, ACR phantom QA &lt;http://pylinac.readthedocs.org/en/stable/cbct_docs.html&gt;`_ -    The CBCT module automatically analyzes DICOM images of a CatPhan 504, 503, 600, 604, Quart DVT, and ACR CT/MR acquired when doing CT, CBCT, or MR quality assurance. It can load a folder or zip file that    the images are in and automatically correct for phantom setup in 6 axes.    CatPhans analyze the HU regions and image scaling (CTP404), the high-contrast line pairs (CTP528) to calculate the modulation transfer function (MTF), and the HU    uniformity (CTP486) on the corresponding slice. Quart and ACR analyze similar metrics where possible.    Features:    * **Automatic phantom registration** - Your phantom can be tilted, rotated, or translated--pylinac will register the phantom.    * **Automatic testing of all major modules** - Major modules are automatically registered and analyzed.    * **Any scan protocol** - Scan your CatPhan with any protocol; or even scan it in a regular CT scanner.      Any field size or field extent is allowed.    * **Customize modules** - You can easily override settings in the event you have a custom scenario such as a partial scan.    Example script:    .. code-block:: python        from pylinac import (            CatPhan504,            CatPhan503,            CatPhan600,            CatPhan604,            QuartDVT,            ACRCT,            ACRMRILarge,        )        # for this example, we'll use the CatPhan504        cbct = CatPhan504(&quot;my/cbct_image_folder&quot;)        cbct.analyze(            hu_tolerance=40,            scaling_tolerance=1,            thickness_tolerance=0.2,            low_contrast_threshold=1,        )        print(cbct.results())        cbct.plot_analyzed_image()        cbct.publish_pdf(&quot;mycbct.pdf&quot;)* `Log Analysis &lt;http://pylinac.readthedocs.org/en/stable/log_analyzer.html&gt;`_ -    The log analyzer module reads and parses Varian linear accelerator machine logs, both Dynalogs and Trajectory logs. The module also    calculates actual and expected fluences as well as performing gamma evaluations. Data is structured to be easily accessible and    easily plottable.    Unlike most other modules of pylinac, the log analyzer module has no end goal. Data is parsed from the logs, but what is done with that    info, and which info is analyzed is up to the user.    Features:    * **Analyze Dynalogs or Trajectory logs** - Either platform is supported. Tlog versions 2.1 and 3.0 supported.    * **Save Trajectory log data to CSV** - The Trajectory log binary data format does not allow for easy export of data. Pylinac lets you do      that so you can use Excel or other software that you use with Dynalogs.    * **Plot or analyze any axis** - Every data axis can be plotted: the actual, expected, and even the difference.    * **View actual or expected fluences &amp; calculate gamma** - View fluences and gamma maps for any log.    * **Anonymization** - Anonymize your logs so you can share them with others.    Example script:    .. code-block:: python        from pylinac import load_log        tlog = load_log(&quot;tlog.bin&quot;)        # after loading, explore any Axis of the Varian structure        tlog.axis_data.gantry.plot_actual()  # plot the gantry position throughout treatment        tlog.fluence.gamma.calc_map(doseTA=1, distTA=1, threshold=10, resolution=0.1)        tlog.fluence.gamma.plot_map()  # show the gamma map as a matplotlib figure        tlog.publish_pdf()  # publish a PDF report        dlog = load_log(&quot;dynalog.dlg&quot;)        ...* `Picket Fence MLC Analysis &lt;http://pylinac.readthedocs.org/en/stable/picketfence.html&gt;`_ -    The picket fence module is meant for analyzing EPID images where a &quot;picket fence&quot; MLC pattern has been made.    Physicists regularly check MLC positioning through this test. This test can be done using film and one can    &quot;eyeball&quot; it, but this is the 21st century and we have numerous ways of quantifying such data. This module    attains to be one of them. It will load in an EPID dicom image and determine the MLC peaks, error of each MLC    pair to the picket, and give a few visual indicators for passing/warning/failing.    Features:    * **Preset &amp; customizable MLC configurations** - Standard configurations are built-in and you can create your own configuration of leaves if needed.    * **Easy-to-read pass/warn/fail overlay** - Analysis gives you easy-to-read tools for determining the status of an MLC pair.    * **Any Source-to-Image distance** - Whatever your clinic uses as the SID for picket fence, pylinac can account for it.    * **Account for panel translation** - Have an off-CAX setup? No problem. Translate your EPID and pylinac knows.    * **Account for panel sag** - If your EPID sags at certain angles, just tell pylinac and the results will be shifted.    Example script:    .. code-block:: python        from pylinac import PicketFence        pf = PicketFence(&quot;mypf.dcm&quot;)        pf.analyze(tolerance=0.5, action_tolerance=0.25)        print(pf.results())        pf.plot_analyzed_image()        pf.publish_pdf()* `Open Field Analysis &lt;http://pylinac.readthedocs.org/en/stable/field_analysis.html&gt;`_ -    Field analysis from a digital image such as EPID DICOM or 2D device array can easily be analyzed. The module contains built-in    flatness and symmetry equation definitions but is extensible to quickly create custom F&amp;S equations.    Features:    * **EPID or device data** - Any EPID image or the SNC Profiler.    * **Built-in F&amp;S equations** - The common Elekta, Varian, and Siemens definitions are included    * **Extensible equations** - Adding custom equations for image metrics are easy    Example script:    .. code-block:: python        from pylinac import FieldAnalysis, DeviceFieldAnalysis, Protocol        fa = FieldAnalysis(path=&quot;myFS.dcm&quot;)  # equivalently, DeviceFieldAnalysis        fa.analyze(protocol=Protocol.VARIAN)        # print results        print(fa.results())        # get results as a dict        fa.results_data()        # plot results        fa.plot_analyzed_image()        # publish a PDF file        fa.publish_pdf(filename=&quot;my field analysis.pdf&quot;)Discussion----------Have questions? Ask them on the `pylinac discussion forum &lt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pylinac&gt;`_.Contributing------------Contributions to pylinac can be many. The most useful things a non-programmer can contribute are images to analyze and bug reports.
