	<longdescription>GTFS Kit********.. image:: https://github.com/mrcagney/gtfs_kit/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svgGTFS Kit is a Python 3.8+ library for analyzing `General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTFS&gt;`_ data in memory without a database.It uses Pandas and Shapely to do the heavy lifting.Installation=============``poetry add gtfs_kit``.Examples========You can find examples in the Jupyter notebook ``notebooks/examples.ipynb``.Authors=========- Alex Raichev (2019-09), maintainerDocumentation=============Documentation is built via Sphinx from the source code in the ``docs`` directory then published to Github Pages at `mrcagney.github.io/gtfs_kit_docs &lt;https://mrcagney.github.io/gtfs_kit_docs&gt;`_.Notes=====- This project's development status is Alpha.  I use GTFS Kit for work and change it breakingly to suit my needs.- This project uses semantic versioning.- I aim for GTFS Kit to handle `the current GTFS &lt;https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference&gt;`_.  In particular, i avoid handling `GTFS extensions &lt;https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/gtfs-extensions&gt;`_.  That is the most reasonable scope boundary i can draw at present, given this project's tiny budget.  If you would like to fund me to expand that scope, feel free to email me.- Thanks to `MRCagney &lt;http://www.mrcagney.com/&gt;`_ for periodically donating to this project.- Constructive feedback and contributions are welcome.  Please issue pull requests from a feature branch into the ``develop`` branch and include tests.- GTFS time is measured relative noon minus 12 hours, which can mess things up when crossing into daylight savings time.  I don't think this issue causes any bugs in GTFS Kit, but you and i have been warned.  Thanks to user derhuerst for bringing this to my attention in `closed Issue 8 &lt;https://github.com/mrcagney/gtfs_kit/issues/8#issue-1063633457&gt;`_.</longdescription>
