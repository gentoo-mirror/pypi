They areupper case with underscores. They often include a unit in theirname.This package provides a collection of symbols representing thosestandard resource classes which are expected to be available inany OpenStack deployment.There also exists a concept of custom resource classes. Theseare countable types that are custom to a particular environment.The OpenStack `placement API`_ provides a way to create these.
