In this case, Ansible and any collectionsneeded must be installed manually on the system.[ansible-core]: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/devel[Python venv doc]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.htmlAdditional `Linux`, `macOS` and `Windows with WSL2` installationinstructions are available in the [Installation guide].[Installation guide]:https://ansible-navigator.readthedocs.io/installation/## WelcomeWhen running `ansible-navigator` with no arguments, you will be presented withthe *welcome page*. From this page, you can run playbooks, browse collections,explore inventories, read Ansible documentation, and more.A full list of key bindings can be viewed by typing `:help`.## Output modesThere are two modes in which ansible-navigator can be run:* The **interactive** mode, which provides a curses-based user interface and  allows you to &quot;zoom in&quot; on data in real time, filter it, and navigate between  various Ansible components; and* The **stdout** mode, which does *not* use curses, and simply returns the  output to the terminal's standard output stream, as Ansible's commands  would.The **interactive** mode is the default and this default can be overwritten bypassing `--mode stdout` (`-m stdout`) or setting `mode` in[configuration][settings documentation].[settings documentation]: https://ansible-navigator.readthedocs.io/settings/## Example commandsAll of ansible-navigator's features can be accessed from the *welcome page*described above, but as a shortcut, commands can also be provided directly ascommand-line arguments.Some examples:* Review and explore available collections: `ansible-navigator collections`* Review and explore current Ansible configuration: `ansible-navigator config`* Review and explore Ansible documentation:  `ansible-navigator doc ansible.netcommon.cli_command`* Review execution environment images available locally:  `ansible-navigator images`* Review and explore an inventory:  `ansible-navigator inventory -i inventory.yaml`* Run and explore a playbook:  `ansible-navigator run site.yaml -i inventory.yaml`Or using the **stdout** mode described above:* Show the current Ansible configuration:  `ansible-navigator config dump -m stdout`* Show documentation: `ansible-navigator doc sudo -t become  -m stdout`... and so on. A full list of subcommands and their relation to Ansiblecommands can be found in the [subcommand documentation].[subcommand documentation]:https://ansible-navigator.readthedocs.io/subcommands/## Configuring ansible-navigatorThere are several ways to configure ansible-navigator and users and projectsare free to choose the most convenient method for them.
