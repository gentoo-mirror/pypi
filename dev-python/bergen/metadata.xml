	<longdescription># Bergen### IdeaBergen is the API-Client for the Arnheim Framework ### PrerequisitesBergen only works with a running Arnheim Instance (in your network or locally for debugging).### UsageIn order to initialize the Client you need to connect it as a Valid Application with your Arnheim Instance```pythonclient = Bergen(host=&quot;p-tnagerl-lab1&quot;,    port=8000,  client_id=&quot;APPLICATION_ID_FROM_ARNHEIM&quot;,   client_secret=&quot;APPLICATION_SECRET_FROM_ARNHEIM&quot;,  name=&quot;karl&quot;,)```In your following code you can simple query your data according to the Schema of the Datapoint```pythonfrom bergen.schema import Nodenode = Node.objects.get(id=1)print(node.name)```## Access Data from different DatapointsThe Arnheim Framework is able to provide data from different Data Endpoints through a commong GraphQL Interface. This allows you to access data from various different storage formats like Elements and Omero and interact withoutknowledge of their underlying api.Each Datapoint provides a typesafe schema. Arnheim Elements provides you with an implemtation of that schema.## Provide a Template for a NodeDocumentation neccesary### Testing and DocumentationSo far Bergen does only provide limitedunit-tests and is in desperate need of documentation,please beware that you are using an Alpha-Version### Build with- [Arnheim](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/arnheim)- [Pydantic](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/arnheim)#### Features- Scss- [Domain-style](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/docs/faq/CodeStructure.md) for code structure- Bundle Size analysis- Code splitting with [react-loadable](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable)## RoadmapThis is considered pre-Alpha so pretty much everything is still on the roadmap## DeploymentContact the Developer before you plan to deploy this App, it is NOT ready for public release## VersioningThere is not yet a working versioning profile in place, consider non-stable for every release ## Authors* **Johannes Roos ** - *Initial work* - [jhnnsrs](https://github.com/jhnnsrs)See also the list of [contributors](https://github.com/your/project/contributors) who participated in this project.## LicenseAttribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC 3.0) ## Acknowledgments* EVERY single open-source project this library used (the list is too extensive so far)</longdescription>
