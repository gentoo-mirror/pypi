There is alimited focus on s3 and AWS Batch and Lambda.  Additional services could beadded, but this project is likely to retain a limited focus.For general client solutions, see[aioboto3](https://github.com/terrycain/aioboto3) and[aiobotocore](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiobotocore), which wrap[botocore](https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)The API documentation is at [readthedocs](https://aio-aws.readthedocs.io/)# InstallThis project has a very limited focus.
