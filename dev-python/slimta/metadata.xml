	<longdescription>#### [Project Homepage][1]#### [Usage Manual][2]--------------------About=====`slimta` is a configurable MTA based on the `python-slimta` libraries. Whilethe purpose of the `python-slimta` library is to avoid configuration files andallow full control via Python code, the `slimta` project recognizes that noteveryone will want or need that level of control. Setup, configuration, andexecution of `slimta` is designed to be familiar to non-programmers.The `slimta` project is released under the [MIT License][3].Getting Started===============Install `slimta` from [PyPi][4]:```console$ pip install slimta```Pip should pull in all the required dependencies. Next, we create the basicconfiguration files:```console$ slimta-setup config```This creates 3 files, in `~/.slimta/` or wherever you specified. The sampleconfigs are designed to work out of the box, so lets give it a shot:```console$ slimta --no-daemon```In another terminal, let's connect to port 1025 to see if it's working. Afterthe banner (the line beginning with `220 `), type in `QUIT` to end the session:```console$ telnet localhost 1025Trying 127.0.0.1...Connected to localhost.Escape character is '^]'.220 localhost.localdomain ESMTP example.com Mail Delivery AgentQUIT221 2.0.0 ByeConnection closed by foreign host.```Port 1025 is fully capable of accepting mail in the SMTP session, but isconfigured by default with the `blackhole` relay to silently discard messages.You can also try it out with the built-in Python SMTP libraries:```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; import smtplib&gt;&gt;&gt; smtplib.SMTP('localhost', 1025).sendmail('test@example.com',                                             ['postmaster@example.com'],                                             'test message')```At this point, we're still a little ways off from where you'd probably like tobe: actually sending and receiving email to the Internet. Please check out the[Usage Manual][2] for information on configuring `slimta` to your liking,including more advanced and custom setups.[1]: http://slimta.org/[2]: http://slimta.org/latest/manual/slimta.html[3]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT[4]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/slimta/## The MIT License (MIT)Copyright (c) 2021 Ian GoodPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
