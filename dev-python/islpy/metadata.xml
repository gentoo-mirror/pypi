It can optionally make useof GMP for support of large integers.One important thing to know about islpy is that it exposes every function in islthat is visible in the headers, not just what isl's authors consider itsdocumented, public API (marked by ``__isl_export``). These (technically)undocumented functions are marked in the islpy documentation. Many of them are usefuland essential for certain operations, but isl's API stability guarantees do notapply to them. Use them at your own risk.</longdescription>
