We are always looking for contributors to help us out!**Steps to contribute:**1. Clone the repository to your local machine2. Create a new branch for your feature3. Run `pip install -r requirements_dev.txt` to install the developer dependencies4. Install all the requriements from setup.py: `pip install -e .`5. Make your changes6. Run `pytest` to make sure all the tests pass7. Create a pull request to merge your branch into master## Running TestsWe use pytest for our testing framework. To run the tests, you can run the following command:```bashpytest```### Showing Code CoverageTo show code coverage, you can run the following command:```bashcoverage run; coverage report; coverage html```#### Adding an Alias on Linux or MacOSThis will show you the code coverage in the terminal and also create a folder called &quot;htmlcov&quot; which will have a file called &quot;index.html&quot;. You can open this file in your browser to see the code coverage in a more readable format.If you don't want to keep typing out the command, you can add it as an alias in bash. To do this, you can run the following command:```bashalias cover='coverage run; coverage report; coverage html'```This will now allow you to run the command by just typing &quot;cover&quot; in the terminal.```bashcover```If you want to also add it to your .bashrc file. You can do this by running the following command:```bashecho &quot;alias cover='coverage run; coverage report; coverage html'&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc```#### Adding an Alias on WindowsIf you are on Windows, you can add an alias by running the following command:Add to your PowerShell Profile: (profile.ps1)```powershellfunction cover {  coverage run coverage report coverage html}```### Setting Up PyTest in VS CodeTo set up in VS Code for debugging, you can add the following to your launch.json file under &quot;configurations&quot;. This will allow you to go into &quot;Run and Debug&quot; and run the tests from there, with breakpoints and everything.NOTE: You may need to change args to the path of your tests folder.```json{    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Python: Pytest&quot;,    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;python&quot;,    &quot;request&quot;: &quot;launch&quot;,    &quot;module&quot;: &quot;pytest&quot;,    &quot;args&quot;: [        &quot;lumibot/tests&quot;    ],    &quot;console&quot;: &quot;integratedTerminal&quot;,}```Here's an example of an actual launch.json file:```json{    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.2.0&quot;,    &quot;configurations&quot;: [        {            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Python: Pytest&quot;,            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;python&quot;,            &quot;request&quot;: &quot;launch&quot;,            &quot;module&quot;: &quot;pytest&quot;,            &quot;args&quot;: [                &quot;lumibot/tests&quot;            ],            &quot;console&quot;: &quot;integratedTerminal&quot;,        }    ]}```## CommunityIf you want to learn more about Lumibot or Algorithmic Trading then you will love out communities!
