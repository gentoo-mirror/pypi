You could build a server really simply and quickly with it. And invite your friends to setup clients on it. It's designed to use your own &quot;Symmetic Encryption Algorithm&quot; and setup a secret key to make your communication hardly to decryped.## SetupInstall with pip```shellpip install outlierchat```## Quick TourAfter setup. You can start a server just start the module outlier as```shellpython -m outlier -s [-i ip_addr] [-p port]```Then you and your friends can easily connect to the server by```shellpython -m outlier -n name -i ip_addr [-p port]```After connected, it's easy to regard it as an online game system. The client firstly is at the server hall where one can type `$info` to check what rooms there exist andhow many people are in it. Then type `$room [room name]` to choose one room or build a new one to enter it and you can easily send and receive messages with your friends.## NoteYou should check you network configuration carefully and thus some knowledge about internet technology shoule be used, such as `NAT`. The ipv4 address and the port of the server should be correctly configured to find the server.## FeatureWe currently use a rolling dynamic asymmetric encrpytion algorithm to keep the channel untracked. The server rolls a pair of public key and private key with RSA algorithm to transmit secret key for a symmetic encryption channel, then the encryped secret key can be safe once the key pair rolls. Only if the network traffic was completely recorded, the encrypting key pais of secret would be lost forever. This means once the channel is disconnected, NO ONE could recover the secret key. However, this design keeps no RSA certificated public key, so anyone could mock a fake one, thus, it's very vulnerable to a fake server or MIIT attack.## DisclaimersThis program is only for temporary secret communication channel and definitely CANNOT escape from decryption by professional security team especially when the source code is open. Thus before you use this tool, you should know that we DO NOT take ANY responsiblility for any behaviours you take and the consequences that would come.## Development logSee [DEVLOG.md](https://github.com/ThetisEliza/outlier/blob/main/DEVLOG.md)## Copyright and License InformationCopyright Phoenix Wang, Micca shi, 2023-2024Distributed under the term of [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/ThetisEliza/outlier/blob/main/LICENSE)</longdescription>
