We also renamed the project to be able to uploadon pypi; see https://pypi.org/project/py-consul/Example-------.. code:: python    import consul    c = consul.Consul()    # poll a key for updates    index = None    while True:        index, data = c.kv.get('foo', index=index)        print data['Value']    # in another process    c.kv.put('foo', 'bar')Installation------------::    pip install py-consul**Note:** When using py-consul library in environment with proxy server, setting of ``http_proxy``, ``https_proxy`` and ``no_proxy`` environment variables can be required for proper functionality.Contributing------------py-consul is currently maintained by Criteo folks.Please reach out if you're interested in being a maintainer as well.
