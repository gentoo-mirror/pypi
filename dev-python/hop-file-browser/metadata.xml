Deleting will move to the recycle bin.Empty your inventory (i.e. clear your selection) with ```!empty``` or ```!e```, and quit with ```!q``` or ```!quit```.Otherwise, run any normal shell commands (i.e. vim, mkdir, rm etc) by using the ! prefix, such as ```!mkdir cool-files```## InstallationThe only requirement for running Hop is python.
