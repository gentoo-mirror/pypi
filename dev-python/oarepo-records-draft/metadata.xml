REST API stays the same with extra operationsfor publish, unpublish, edit published record. REST example (some links omitted for brevity):```bash$ curl --header &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \  --request POST \  --data '{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;blah&quot;}' \  https://localhost:5000/api/draft/records/returns:    {      &quot;metadata&quot;: {        &quot;title&quot;: &quot;blah&quot;,        &quot;oarepo:validity&quot;: {          &quot;valid&quot;: false,          &quot;marshmallow&quot;: [            &quot;field&quot;: &quot;title&quot;,            &quot;message&quot;: &quot;too short&quot;          ]        }      }    }$ curl --header &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \  --request PUT \  --data '{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;longer blah&quot;}' \  https://localhost:5000/api/draft/records/1returns:    {      &quot;links&quot;: {        &quot;publish&quot;: &quot;https://localhost:5000/api/draft/records/1/publish/&quot;      },      &quot;metadata&quot;: {        &quot;title&quot;: &quot;longer blah&quot;,        &quot;oarepo:validity&quot;: {          &quot;valid&quot;: true        }      }    }$ curl --request POST \  https://localhost:5000/api/draft/records/1/publish/returns:    302 Location https://localhost:5000/api/records/1```## Installation```bashpip install oarepo-records-draft oarepo-validate```## ConfigurationTo enable the library for your data model, you have to perform the following steps:  * write the &quot;published&quot; version of your model, including marshmallow, mapping and json schemas.  * Inherit the record from ``SchemaKeepingRecordMixin`` and ``MarshmallowValidatedRecordMixin``    from ``oarepo-validate`` modules. See [oarepo-validate](https://github.com/oarepo/oarepo-validate)    library for details on on-record validation vs. rest-access validation.      Have a look at [a sample record](sample/sample/record.py)  * Drop marshmallow loader &amp; serializer from loaders and serializers, see oarepo-validate for details  * Move the configuration of rest endpoint from ``RECORDS_REST_ENDPOINTS`` to ``RECORDS_DRAFT_ENDPOINTS``.    Add ``&quot;draft&quot;: &quot;&lt;draftpid&gt;&quot;`` to the configuration, where ``draftpid`` is any unused pid type    less or equal 6 chars in length.```pythonRECORDS_DRAFT_ENDPOINTS = {             # &lt;--- moved here    'recid': dict(        draft='drecid',                 # &lt;--- added here        pid_type='recid',        pid_minter='recid',        pid_fetcher='recid',        list_route='/records/',        item_route='/records/&lt;{0}:pid_value&gt;'.format(RECORD_PID),        # rest of the stuff here    ),}RECORDS_REST_ENDPOINTS = {}             # &lt;--- made empty ```    * Do not forget to propagate this variable to the application's config (for example, in ext/init_config)  * Add endpoint for draft to the same dict:```pythonRECORDS_DRAFT_ENDPOINTS = {            'recid': dict(        draft='drecid',        # as above    ),    'drecid': dict(                     # &lt;--- added here        )}```    * move create/update/delete permission factories from the published endpoint to the draft one    - published record will automatically get ``deny_all`` for all modification operations    - in the example below everyone can create/update/delete draft record, which is probably not what you want```pythonRECORDS_DRAFT_ENDPOINTS = {                'recid': dict(        # as above                          ),    'drecid': dict(                     # &lt;--- moved here        create_permission_factory_imp=allow_all,        delete_permission_factory_imp=allow_all,        update_permission_factory_imp=allow_all,    )}```      * on published endpoint, add permission factories for publish/unpublish/edit```pythonRECORDS_DRAFT_ENDPOINTS = {                'recid': dict(        # as above                      # &lt;--- added here            publish_permission_factory_imp=allow_logged_in,        unpublish_permission_factory_imp=allow_logged_in,        edit_permission_factory_imp=allow_logged_in,    ),    'drecid': dict(                             create_permission_factory_imp=allow_all,        delete_permission_factory_imp=allow_all,        update_permission_factory_imp=allow_all,    )}```    Run ``invenio index init/create``, start server and you're done. A new endpoint has been created for you and is at ``/api/draft/records``. The whole configuration is in [sample app](sample/sample/)## Library principles:1.  Draft records follow the same json schema as published records with the exception     that:    &gt; 1.  invalid records are stored and indexed    &gt; 2.  all properties are not required even though they are marked as such.     &gt; 3.  Extra properties not defined in marshmallow/json schema can be stored but are           marked invalid and the properties are not indexed in ES.2.  &quot;Draft&quot; records live at a different endpoint and different ES index    than published ones. The recommended URL is `/api/records` for the    published records and `/api/draft/records` for drafts3.  Draft and published records share the same value of pid but have two    different pid types4.  Published records can not be directly created/updated/patched. Draft    records can be created/updated/patched.5.  Invenio record contains `Link` header and `links` section in the    JSON payload. Links of a published record contain (apart from    `self`):    &gt; 1.  `draft` - a url that links to the &quot;draft&quot; version of the         record. This url is present only if the draft version of the         record exists and the caller has the rights to edit the draft    &gt; 2.  `edit` - URL to a handler that creates a draft version of the         record and then returns HTTP 302 redirect to the draft         version. This url is present only if the draft version does         not exist    &gt; 3.  `unpublish` - URL to a handler that creates a draft version of         the record if it does not exist, deletes the published version         and then returns HTTP 302 to the draft.6.  On a draft record the `links` contain (apart from `self`):    &gt; 1.  `published` - a url that links to the &quot;published&quot; version of         the record. This url is present only if the published version         of the record exists    &gt; 2.  `publish` - a POST to this url publishes the record. The         JSONSchema and marshmallow schema of the published record must         pass. After the publishing the draft record is deleted. HTTP         302 is returned pointing to the published record.7.  The serialized representation of a draft record contains a section    named `oarepo:validity`. This section contains the result    of marshmallow and JSONSchema validation against original schemas.8. Deletion of a published record does not delete the draft record.9. Deletion of a draft record does not delete the published record.10. All properties on published RECORDS_REST_ENDPOINTS are propagated to the draft endpoint,   some of those modified. For a complete list/algorithm, see    [setup_draft_endpoint method in endpoints.py](oarepo_records_draft/endpoints.py)## REST APINormal invenio-records-rest API is available both on ``draft`` and ``published`` endpoints,with the exception that published endpoints have the implicit permissions of ``create/update/delete`` operations set to ``deny_all``. ### Publishing draft recordLet's create a record (security not shown here):```bash$ curl --header &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \  --request POST \  --data '{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;blah&quot;}' \  https://localhost:5000/api/draft/records/201 Location https://localhost:5000/api/draft/records/1```And get it to see, if it is valid:```bash$ curl https://localhost:5000/api/draft/records/1{  links: {    self: https://localhost:5000/api/draft/records/1,    publish: https://localhost:5000/api/draft/records/1/publish/  },  metadata: {    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;blah&quot;,    &quot;oarepo:validity&quot;: {       &quot;valid&quot;: true     }  }}```As it is valid, we can publish the record (security not shown here):```bash$ curl --request POST \  https://localhost:5000/api/draft/records/1/publish/302 Location https://localhost:5000/api/records/1```And when retrieved, it does not contain the validation section:```bash$ curl https://localhost:5000/api/records/1{  links: {    self: https://localhost:5000/api/records/1,    unpublish: https://localhost:5000/api/records/1/unpublish/,    edit: https://localhost:5000/api/records/1/edit/  },  metadata: {    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;blah&quot;  }}```### Editing published recordPublished record can not be edited in place, at first a draft record should be created. See the linkssection above for edit url:```bash$ curl --request POST \  https://localhost:5000/api/records/1/edit/302 Location https://localhost:5000/api/draft/records/1```Now the published record is still available (and not modified) and you have a url for the draft record for making your changes. When finished, run ``publish`` action above to publishyour changes.### Unpublishing published recordTo remove a published record and &quot;move&quot; it to draft, call unpublish:```bash$ curl --request POST \  https://localhost:5000/api/records/1/unpublish/302 Location https://localhost:5000/api/draft/records/1```After this action, the published record is deleted (and says 410 gone) and draft record is created.You can delete the draft record if desired or update and publish it again.### FilesIf ``invenio-files-rest`` is installed, the configuration of ``RECORDS_DRAFT_ENDPOINTS``might contain a ``file`` section:```pythonRECORDS_DRAFT_ENDPOINTS = {    'recid': dict(        draft='drecid',        # ...    ),    'drecid': dict(        # ...        files=dict(            put_file_factory=Permission(RoleNeed('role1')),            get_file_factory=Permission(RoleNeed('role1')),            delete_file_factory=Permission(RoleNeed('role1')),            # restricted=False,            # as_attachment=False        )    )}```Permission factories have a signature:```permission_factory(view: [oarepo_records_draft.actions.files.FileResource|FileListResource],                   record: Record,                    key: str,                    file_object: invenio_record_files.api.FileObject)```and returns an object with ``can()`` method.Adding the factory creates urls in the same manner as ``invenio-records-rest``:```/api/&lt;records or draft records&gt;/&lt;recid&gt;/files/    GET  ... lists all the files uploaded to a record    POST&lt;form data with a file&gt; ... uploads a file and associates metadata with the file/api/&lt;records&gt;/&lt;recid&gt;/files/&lt;key&gt;   GET  ... downloads file with the given key   PUT  ... creates or updates file at the given key, payload is the file stream   DELETE ... removes file at the given key ```### Extra REST actionsYou can add extra rest actions for each resource that are registered within draft blueprint. They can be registered either globally via entry points (see python api later) or locally in the configuration:```pythonRECORDS_DRAFT_ENDPOINTS = {    'recid': dict(        draft='drecid',        # ...    ),    'drecid': dict(        # ...        actions={            'path': &lt;handler_function_registered_to_blueprint&gt;,            # ...        }    )}```## Python APIThe entrypoint to python API is at ``oarepo_records_draft.current_drafts``. It has the followingpublic methods:### ``publish(record: Record, record_pid: PersistentIdentifier)``Publishes an instance of draft record with draft pid ``record_pid``. Raises InvalidRecordException if the record is not valid (according to jsonschema/marshmallow)and can not be published. Returns a list of ``(draft_record: Record, published_record_context: RecordContext)`` tuples.#### What it does:   1. invokes ``collect_records_for_action`` signal to collect all records that should be published      (sometimes linked records should be published as well)   2. calls ``check_can_publish`` signal for each collected record   3. calls ``before_publish`` signal   4. for each record in reversed collected records publishes the record and deletes draft one   5. calls ``after_publish`` signal   6. for each record removes draft record from elasticsearch and indexes published one   7. refreshes affected ES indices   ### ``unpublish(record: Record, record_pid: PersistentIdentifier)``Removes published instance and creates a draft one. ``record`` is the published record beingunpublished, ``record_pid`` is its persistent identifier.Returns a list of ``(published_record: Record, draft_record_context: RecordContext)`` tuples.#### What it does:   1. invokes ``collect_records_for_action`` signal to collect all records that should be published      (sometimes linked records should be published as well)   2. calls ``check_can_unpublish`` signal for each collected record   3. calls ``before_unpublish`` signal   4. for each record in reversed collected records removes the published record and creates draft   5. calls ``after_unpublish`` signal   6. for each record removes published record from elasticsearch and indexes draft one   7. refreshes affected ES indices      ### ``edit(record: Record, record_pid: PersistentIdentifier)``Keeps published instance and creates a draft one. ``record`` is the published record to be edited, ``record_pid`` is its persistent identifier.Returns a list of ``(published_record: Record, draft_record_context: RecordContext)`` tuples.#### What it does:   1. invokes ``collect_records_for_action`` signal to collect all records that should be published      (sometimes linked records should be published as well)   2. calls ``check_can_edit`` signal for each collected record   3. calls ``before_edit`` signal   4. for each record in reversed collected records removes creates draft record   5. calls ``after_edit`` signal   6. Indexes each created draft record in ES   7. refreshes affected ES indices### SignalsSee [signals.py](oarepo_records_draft/signals.py) for the exhaustive list of signals### Globally-defined actionsTo define actions on all draft-managed resources, create your view and a factory function. The function is called for  that returns a dictionary with actions for the given endpoint:```pythonclass TestResource(MethodView):    view_name = '{endpoint}_test'    @pass_record    def get(self, pid, record):        return jsonify({'status': 'ok'})def action_factory(code, files, rest_endpoint, extra, is_draft):    # decide if view should be created on this resource and return blueprint mapping    # rest path -&gt; view     return {        'files/_test': TestResource.as_view(            TestResource.view_name.format(endpoint=code)        )    }```Register the factory to entry points and all records will have an additional rest actionat path ``/api/&lt;records&gt;/1/files/_test`````pythonentry_points={    'oarepo_records_draft.extra_actions': [        'sample = sample.test:extras'    ]}```### Custom uploadersSometimes you might want to define a custom uploader that creates ``record.files[key]`` instead of the default implementation of ``record.files[key] = &lt;stream from request&gt;``. This might be usable for example when the stream will be provided in a different way (direct link to S3, for example).Create an uploader function (this one is from tests and replaces content for ``test-uploader`` key):```def uploader(record, key, files, pid, request, resolver, endpoint, **kwargs):    if key == 'test-uploader':        bt = BytesIO(b'blah')        files[key] = bt        return lambda: ({            'test-uploader': True,            'url': resolver(TestResource.view_name)        })```The function returns either ``None`` if it did not handle the upload or a no-arg functionthat is used later to return JSON that will be serialized as HTTP 200/201 response.  Register the function to entry points:```pythonentry_points={    'oarepo_records_draft.uploaders': [        'sample = sample.test:uploader'    ]}```### Facets and filtersTo add facets and filters for validation errors, import and use ``DRAFT_FACETS`` and ``DRAFT_FILTERS`````pythonfrom oarepo_records_draft import DRAFT_FACETS, DRAFT_FILTERSRECORDS_REST_FACETS = {    'draft-records-record-v1.0.0': {        'aggs': {            # ...            **DRAFT_FACETS        },        'filters': {            # ...            **DRAFT_FILTERS        }    }}```## Q&amp;A### Can I provide my own record class for draft records?Yes. The class has to inherit ``DraftRecordMixin``, ``SchemaKeepingRecordMixin`` and ``MarshmallowValidatedRecordMixin``. ``DraftRecordMixin`` should be the first mixin.Set ``record_class`` property in ``RECORDS_DRAFT_ENDPOINTS/&lt;your draft endpoint&gt;``### Can I provide my own link factory for either draft or published record?Yes. Provide ``links_factory_imp`` as usual and it will get called. URLs for publishing/unpublishing/editing will be added automatically### Can I change XXX in rest config?Yes, you can. Some of the values are automatically provided for drafts, pleaseconsult [endpoints.py](oarepo_records_draft/endpoints.py) to see if the valueshould be modified for draft record or not.### I have my own ``record_to_index`` implementation. Is this library compatible?Might be. See [record.py](oarepo_records_draft/record.py) to see which index must be usedfor draft records.### I really need to raise exception when user submits incorrect dataThink twice if you really want to do it, as it prevents users to pass incompleterecord and work on it later.If you really want to abort the process, raise an instance of ``FatalDraftException``from within the marshmallow validation. This exception will cause the validation to terminateand the draft record will not be modified/created.You can use the exception to re-raise a custom exception, for example:```pythonfrom oarepo_records_draft import FatalDraftExceptionfrom flask import aborttry:    # do something that can lead to    abort(403)except Exception as e:    raise FatalDraftException() from e```The wrapped exception will later be retrieved and passed on to later stages of processing,and the correct HTTP 403 error page/json will be sent to the user.</longdescription>
