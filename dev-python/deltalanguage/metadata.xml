	<longdescription># Deltalanguage[![Build Status](http://jenkins-riverlane.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/buildStatus/icon?job=deltalanguage_multibranch_build%2Fdev)](http://jenkins-riverlane.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/job/deltalanguage_multibranch_build/job/dev/)Deltalanguage allows the programmer to represent their computational model as a graph. It allows the definition of heterogenous compute elements as well the transport mechanism between them.Depending on which type of hardware a part of the program is running on,the nodes of this graph get coded with Python (for the CPU) or Migen(for the FPGAs).A hardware abstraction layer is built into the language, that standardiseswhich operations can be triggered on qubits. This makes Deltaflow portable across technologies.Deltalanguage is used by the Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ system, documentationfor this system and all its components can be found [here](https://riverlane.github.io/deltaflow-on-artiq). ## Quick Links* [Documentation](https://riverlane.github.io/deltalanguage)* [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/deltalanguage)* [GitHub](https://github.com/riverlane/deltalanguage)* [Riverlane Website](https://www.riverlane.com/)* [Official Deltaflow Discord](https://discord.gg/Gd2bYKvAeW)## Contact UsIf you experience version incompatibilities, have feature requests or just wantto talk to our team about this project: send us an[email](mailto:deltaflow@riverlane.com).</longdescription>
