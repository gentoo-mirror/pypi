Once Jupyter Book hits 1.0, it will slow downconsiderably!## Contribute or improve the bookNotice some inefficient CSS? A typo in the text? Want to add a cool feature so that otherscan enjoy the improvements to Jupyter Books? Check out the [Jupyter Book Contributor'sGuide](https://jupyterbook.org/contribute/intro.html). We'd love your help!## AcknowledgementsJupyter Book is maintained and primarily developed bythe [Executable Book Project](https://executablebooks.org).[pypi-badge]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/jupyter-book.svg[pypi-link]: https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-book[conda-badge]: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jupyter-book/badges/version.svg[conda-link]: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jupyter-book</longdescription>
