We currently support AWS,GCP, Azure, and Lambda Labs credentials through SkyPilot, as well as BYO cluster (just dropin an ip address and ssh key).## 🚨 This is an Alpha 🚨Runhouse is heavily under development and we expect to iterateon the APIs before reaching beta (version 0.1.0).## 🐣 Getting Startedtldr;```commandlinepip install runhouse# Or &quot;runhouse[aws]&quot;, &quot;runhouse[gcp]&quot;, &quot;runhouse[azure]&quot;, &quot;runhouse[all]&quot;sky check# Optionally, for portability (e.g. Colab):runhouse login```### 🔌 Installation⚠️ On Apple M1 or M2 machines ⚠️, you will need to install grpcio with condabefore you install Runhouse - more specifically, before you install Ray.If you already have Ray installed, you can skip this.[See here](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-overview/installation.html#m1-mac-apple-silicon-support)for how to install grpc properly on Apple silicon. You'll only know if you didthis correctly if you run `ray.init()` in a Python interpreter. If you'rehaving trouble with this, let us know.Runhouse can be installed with:```pip install runhouse```Depending on which cloud providers you plan to use, you can also install the followingadditional dependencies (to install the right versions of tools like boto, gsutil, etc.):```commandlinepip install &quot;runhouse[aws]&quot;pip install &quot;runhouse[gcp]&quot;pip install &quot;runhouse[azure]&quot;# Orpip install &quot;runhouse[all]&quot;```As this is an alpha, we push feature updates every few weeks as new microversions.### ✈️ Verifying your Cloud Setup with SkyPilotRunhouse supports both BYO cluster, where you interact with existing compute via theirIP address and SSH key, and autoscaled clusters, where we spin up and down cloud instancesin your own cloud account for you. If you only plan to use BYO clusters, you candisregard the following.Runhouse uses [SkyPilot](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) formuch of the heavy lifting with launching and terminating cloud instances.We love it and you should [throw them a Github star ⭐️](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot/).To verify that your cloud credentials are set up correctly for autoscaling, run```sky check```in your command line. This will confirm which cloud providers are ready touse, and will give detailed instructions if any setup is incomplete. SkyPilot alsoprovides an excellent suite of CLI commands for basic instance management operations.There are a few that you'll be reaching for frequently when using Runhouse with autoscalingthat you should familiarize yourself with,[here](https://runhouse-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/overview/compute.html#on-demand-clusters).### 🔒 Creating a Runhouse Account for Secrets and PortabilityUsing Runhouse with only the OSS Python package is perfectly fine. However,you can unlock some unique portability features by creating an (always free)account on [api.run.house](https://api.run.house) and saving your secrets and/orresource metadata there. For example, you can open a Google Colab, call `runhouse login`,and all of your secrets or resources will be ready to use there with no additional setup.Think of the OSS-package-only experience as akin to Microsoft Office,while creating an account will make your cloud resources sharable and accessiblefrom anywhere like Google Docs. Youcan see examples of this portability in the[Runhouse Tutorials](https://github.com/run-house/tutorials).To create an account, visit [api.run.house](https://api.run.house),or simply call `runhouse login` from the command line (or`rh.login()` from Python).&gt; **Note**:These portability features only ever store light metadata about your resources(e.g. my_folder_name -&gt; [provider, bucket, path]) on our API servers. All the actual data and computestays inside your own cloud account and never hits our servers. The Secrets service storesyour secrets in Hashicorp Vault (an industry standard for secrets management), and our secretsAPIs simply call Vault's APIs. We never store secrets on our API servers. We plan to addsupport for BYO secrets management shortly. Let us know if you need it and which system you use.## 👨🏫 Tutorials / API Walkthrough / Docs[Tutorials can be found here](https://github.com/run-house/tutorials). They have been structured to provide acomprehensive walkthrough of the APIs.[Docs can be found here](https://runhouse-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html).They include both high-level overviews of the architecture and detailed API references.## 🎪 FunhouseCheck out [Funhouse](https://github.com/run-house/funhouse) for running fun applications using Runhouse --think the latest Stable Diffusion models, text generation models, launching Gradio spaces, and even more!## 🙋♂️ Getting HelpPlease join our [discord server here](https://discord.gg/RnhB6589Hs)to message us, or email us (first name at run.house), or create an issue.## 👷♀️ ContributingWe welcome contributions!
