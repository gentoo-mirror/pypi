Additionally, it removes a few limits that the original package has.*datetime2* is a one-man, free-time work. Project is hosted at GitHub, pleasefollow the source code link on the right to see the latest version of thispage (e.g. for an updated release map).Current and future releases===========================Current:* 0.9.4: Implementation of WesternTimeDeltaPlanned:* 1.0: Implementation of DateTime, first production release* 1.1: Implementation of Julian and Hebrew calendarsProject objectives==================* Decoupling between operations on date and time objects and their  representation.* Access to different calendars, for input parsing and output formatting.* Access to different time representations, also for input and output.* Infinite precision in converting between different time representations.* Ability to dynamically register new formatting classes.* Internationalization.* Implementation of the part of the Unicode Locale Database concerned with  dates and times.* Interface with other Python modules or inclusion of their  functionalities in submodules.These objectives are very long term ones, which I am setting because I think it isimportant to establish a direction for the project.License=======Datetime2 is distributed under the terms of the new BSD license.
