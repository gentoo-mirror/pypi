	<longdescription># Hatch Build ScriptsA plugin for [Hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) that allows you to run arbitrarybuild scripts and include their artifacts in your package distributions.## InstallationTo set up `hatch-build-scripts` for your project you'll need to configure it in yourproject's `pyproject.toml` file as a `build-system` requirement:```toml[build-system]requires = [&quot;hatchling&quot;, &quot;hatch-build-scripts&quot;]build-backend = &quot;hatchling.build&quot;```## UsageNow you'll need to configure the build scripts you want to run. This is done by addingan array of scripts to the `tool.hatch.build.hooks.build-scripts.scripts` key in your`pyproject.toml` file. Each script is configured with the following keys:| Key | Default | Description || --- | ------- | ----------- || `commands` | required | An array of commands to run. Each command is run in a separate shell. || `artifacts` | required | An array of artifact patterns (same as `.gitignore`) to include in your package distributions. || `out_dir` | `&quot;.&quot;` | The directory to copy artifacts into. || `work_dir` | `&quot;.&quot;` | The directory to run the commands in. All artifact patterns are relative to this directory. || `clean_artifacts` | `true` | Whether to clean files from the `out_dir` that match the artifact patterns before running the commands. || `clean_out_dir` | `false` | Whether to clean the `out_dir` before running the commands. |In practice this looks like:```toml[[tool.hatch.build.hooks.build-scripts.scripts]]out_dir = &quot;out&quot;commands = [    &quot;echo 'Hello, world!' &gt; hello.txt&quot;,    &quot;echo 'Goodbye, world!' &gt; goodbye.txt&quot;,]artifacts = [    &quot;hello.txt&quot;,    &quot;goodbye.txt&quot;,][[tool.hatch.build.hooks.build-scripts.scripts]]# you can add more scripts here...```You can configure script defaults for scripts by adding a `[tool.hatch.build.hooks.build-scripts]` table to your `pyproject.toml` file. The following keys are supported:| Key | Default | Description || --- | ------- | ----------- || `out_dir` | `&quot;.&quot;` | The directory to copy artifacts into. || `work_dir` | `&quot;.&quot;` | The directory to run the commands in. All artifact patterns are relative to this directory. || `clean_artifacts` | `true` | Whether to clean files from the `out_dir` that match the artifact patterns before running the commands. || `clean_out_dir` | `false` | Whether to clean the `out_dir` before running the commands. |</longdescription>
