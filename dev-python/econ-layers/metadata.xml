	<longdescription># Pytorch Layers for Economics Applications[![image](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/econ_layers.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/econ_layers) [![Build Status](https://github.com/HighDimensionalEconLab/econ_layers/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HighDimensionalEconLab/econ_layers/actions)## Pytorch -   Documentation: https://HighDimensionalEconLab.github.io/econ_layers## Features- Exponential layer- Flexible multi-layer neural network with optional nonlinear last layer- Affine rescaling of output by an input## DevelopmentTo publish a new relase to pypi,1. Ensure that the CI is passing2. Modify [setup.py](setup.py#L56) to increment the minor version number, or a major version number once API stability is enforced3. Choose the &quot;Releases&quot; on the github page, then &quot;Draft a new relase&quot;4. Click on &quot;Choose a tag&quot; and then type a new release tag with the `v` followed by the version number you modified to be consistent5. After you choose &quot;Publish Release&quot; it will automatically push to pypi, and you can change compatability bounds in downstream packages as required.## CreditsThis package was created with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) and the [giswqs/pypackage](https://github.com/giswqs/pypackage) project template.</longdescription>
