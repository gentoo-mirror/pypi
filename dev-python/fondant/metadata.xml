This need not be the case, however, if processingcomponents would be reusable and exchangeable and pipelines were easily composable. Realizing this is the main vision behind Fondant.&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;#chocolate_bar-fondant&quot;&gt;back to top&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;## üí® Getting StartedAnxious to get started? Here's is a [step by step guide](https://fondant.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started) to get your first pipeline up and running.## ü™Ñ Example pipelinesCurious to see what Fondant can do? Have a look at our example pipelines:### Filtering creative commons image datasetWe have published an image dataset containing 25 million images. As a result, we have provided a [sample pipeline](examples/pipelines/filter-cc-25m) that demonstrates the download and filtering of these images. In the pipeline folder, you will find detailed instructions on how to execute the pipeline and explore the images.### Fine-tuning ControlNetOur [example pipeline to generate data for ControlNet fine-tuning](examples/pipelines/controlnet-interior-design) allows you to create models that you can control using inpainting, segmentation, and regeneration. All you need to get started is a set of prompts describing the type of images to generate.For instance, using our ControlNet model fine-tuned on interior design images, allows you to generate the room of your dreams:| Input image                                                                                                          | Output image                                                                                                           ||----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| ![input image](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant/blob/main/docs/art/interior_design_controlnet_input1.png?raw=true) | ![output image](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant/blob/main/docs/art/interior_design_controlnet_output1.jpg?raw=true) |Want to try out the resulting model yourself, head over to our [Hugging Face space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ml6team/controlnet-interior-design)!### Fine-tuning Stable DiffusionUsing our [example pipeline to fine-tune Stable Diffusion](examples/pipelines/finetune_stable_diffusion) allows you to create models that generate better images within a specific domain. All you need to get started is a small seed dataset of example images.Eg. generating logos:| Stable Diffusion 1.5                                                                                     | Fine-tuned Stable Diffusion 1.5              ||----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|| ![input image](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant/blob/main/docs/art/logo_stable_diffusion.jpg?raw=true) | ![output image](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant/blob/main/docs/art/logo_finetuned.jpeg?raw=true) |### Training StarcoderUsing our [example pipeline to train StarCoder](examples/pipelines/starcoder) provides a starting point to create datasets for training code assistants.&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;#chocolate_bar-fondant&quot;&gt;back to top&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;### Filtering creative commons image datasetWe have published an image dataset containing 25 million images.

All Fondant needs is an url pointing to the Kubeflow pipeline host and an Object Storage provider (S3, GCS, etc) to store data produced in the pipeline between steps.  We have compiled some references and created some scripts to [get you started](https://fondant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/infrastructure) with setting up the required infrastructure.- Or locally by using [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). This way is mainly aimed at helping you develop fondant pipelines and components faster by making it easier to run things on a smaller scale.The same pipeline can be used in both variants allowing you to quickly develop and iterate using the local Docker Compose implementation and then using the power of Kubeflow pipelines to run a large scale pipeline.&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;#chocolate_bar-fondant&quot;&gt;back to top&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;## üë®üíª Usage#### PipelineFondant allows you to easily define data pipelines comprised of both reusable and custom components. The following pipeline for instance uses the reusable `load_from_hf_hub` component to load a dataset from the Hugging Face Hub and process it using a custom component:```pythonfrom fondant.pipeline import ComponentOp, Pipeline, Clientdef build_pipeline():    pipeline = Pipeline(pipeline_name=&quot;example pipeline&quot;, base_path=&quot;fs://bucket&quot;)    load_from_hub_op = ComponentOp.from_registry(        name=&quot;load_from_hf_hub&quot;,        arguments={&quot;dataset_name&quot;: &quot;lambdalabs/pokemon-blip-captions&quot;},    )    pipeline.add_op(load_from_hub_op)    custom_op = ComponentOp(        component_dir=&quot;components/custom_component&quot;,        arguments={            &quot;min_width&quot;: 600,            &quot;min_height&quot;: 600,        },    )    pipeline.add_op(custom_op, dependencies=load_from_hub_op)    return pipeline    if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    client = Client(host=&quot;https://kfp-host.com/&quot;)    pipeline = build_pipeline()    client.compile_and_run(pipeline=pipeline)```#### ComponentTo create a custom component, you first need to describe its contract as a yaml specification. It defines the data consumed and produced by the component and any arguments it takes.```yamlname: Custom componentdescription: This is a custom componentimage: custom_component:latestconsumes:  images:    fields:      data:        type: binaryproduces:  captions:    fields:      data:        type: utf8args:  argument1:    description: An argument passed to the component at runtime    type: str  argument2:    description: Another argument passed to the component at runtime    type: str```Once you have your component specification, all you need to do is implement a constructor and a single `.transform` method and Fondant will do the rest. You will get the data defined in your specification partition by partition as a Pandas dataframe.```pythonimport pandas as pdfrom fondant.component import PandasTransformComponentfrom fondant.executor import PandasTransformExecutorclass ExampleComponent(PandasTransformComponent):    def __init__(self, *args, argument1, argument2) -&gt; None:        &quot;&quot;&quot;        Args:            argumentX: An argument passed to the component        &quot;&quot;&quot;        # Initialize your component here based on the arguments    def transform(self, dataframe: pd.DataFrame) -&gt; pd.DataFrame:        &quot;&quot;&quot;Implement your custom logic in this single method        Args:            dataframe: A Pandas dataframe containing the data        Returns:            A pandas dataframe containing the transformed data        &quot;&quot;&quot;```For more advanced use cases, you can use the `DaskTransformComponent` instead.###  Running your pipelineOnce you have a pipeline you can easily run (and compile) it by using the built-in CLI:```bashfondant run pipeline.py --local```To see all available arguments you can check the fondant CLI help pages```bashfondant --help```Or for a subcommand:```bashfondant &lt;subcommand&gt; --help```&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;#chocolate_bar-fondant&quot;&gt;back to top&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;## üöß Current state and roadmapFondant is currently in the alpha stage, offering a minimal viable interface. While you should expect to run into rough edges, the foundations are ready and Fondant should already be able to speed up your data preparation work.**The following topics are on our roadmap**- Local pipeline execution- Non-linear pipeline DAGs- LLM-focused example pipelines and reusable components- Static validation, caching, and partial execution of pipelines- Data lineage and experiment tracking- Distributed execution, both on and off cluster- Support other dataframe libraries such as HF Datasets, Polars, Spark- Move reusable components into a decentralized component registry- Create datasets of copy-right free data for fine-tuning- Create reusable components for bias detection and mitigationThe roadmap and priority are defined based on community feedback. To provide input, you can join [our discord](https://discord.gg/HnTdWhydGp) or submit an idea in our [Github Discussions](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant/discussions/categories/ideas).For a detailed view on the roadmap and day to day development, you can check our [github project board](https://github.com/orgs/ml6team/projects/1).&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;#chocolate_bar-fondant&quot;&gt;back to top&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;## üë≠ ContributingWe welcome contributions of different kinds:|                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ||----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| **Issues**                       | If you encounter any issue or bug, please submit them as a [Github issue](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant/issues).
