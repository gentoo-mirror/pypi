Ultimately we would like to formalize this schema and a protocol to extract or expose it from apps.This which would allow Trogon to build TUIs for any CLI app, regardless of how it was built.If you are familiar with Swagger, think Swagger for CLIs.## Screenshots&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-05-20 at 12 07 31&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/Textualize/trogon/assets/554369/009cf3f2-f0c4-464b-bd74-60e303864443&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-05-20 at 12 08 21&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/Textualize/trogon/assets/554369/b1039ee6-4ba6-4123-b0dd-aa7b2341672f&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-05-20 at 12 08 53&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/Textualize/trogon/assets/554369/c0a42277-e946-4bef-b0d0-3fa87e4ab55b&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-05-20 at 12 09 47&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/Textualize/trogon/assets/554369/55477f6c-e6b8-49b6-85c1-b01bee006c8e&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;## Why?Command line apps reward repeated use, but they lack in *discoverability*.If you don't use a CLI app frequently, or there are too many options to commit to memory, a Trogon TUI interface can help you (re)discover options and switches.## What does the name mean?This project started life as a [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) experiment, which we have been giving give bird's names to.A [Trogon](https://www.willmcgugan.com/blog/photography/post/costa-rica-trip-report-2017/#bird) is a beautiful bird I was lucky enough to photograph in 2017.See also [Frogmouth](https://github.com/Textualize/frogmouth), a Markdown browser for the terminal.## RoadmapTrogon is usable now. It is only 2 lines (!) of code to add to an existing project.It is still in an early stage of development, and we have lots of improvements planned for it.## InstallingTrogon may be installed with PyPI.```bashpip install trogon```## Quickstart1. Import `from trogon import tui`2. Add the `@tui` decorator above your click app. e.g.    ```python    @tui()    @click.group(...)    def cli():        ...    ```3. Your click app will have a new `tui` command available.See also the `examples` folder for two example apps.## Custom command name and custom helpBy default the command added will be called `tui` and the help text for it will be `Open Textual TUI.`You can customize one or both of these using the `help=` and `command=` parameters:```python@tui(command=&quot;ui&quot;, help=&quot;Open terminal UI&quot;)@click.group(...)def cli():    ...```## Follow this projectIf this app interests you, you may want to join the Textual [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr) where you can talk to Textual developers / community.</longdescription>
