	<longdescription># pytest-srcpathsAdd paths to `sys.path`.  A pytest plugin to help pytest find the code you want to test.## InstallationInstall with pip:    pip install pytest-srcpaths## UsageAdd a line in your pytest.ini file with a key of `srcpaths`.It should contain a space-separated list of paths.    [pytest]    srcpaths = src libPaths are relative to the directory that pytest.ini is in.  You can include the top level directory with a dot.    [pytest]    srcpaths = .## Alternatively, use `pythonpath`The option `pythonpath` also works the same.    [pytest]    pythonpath = src libpytest 7 (not released yet) is planned to include the `pythonpath` option. For pytest 6.2.x, this plugin will work.## Changelog* 1.2.1 - Add `pythonpath` as an alternative to `srcpath` option for pytest versions &lt; 7.0.0  * this is to allow this project to act as a temporary workaround until pytest 7 is released## Similar projectThis plugin was inspired by [pytest-pythonpath](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-pythonpath/) whose implementation and scope are a bit different.</longdescription>
