	<longdescription>libpcap=======Python binding for the *libpcap* C library.Overview========| Python |package_bold| module is a low-level binding for *libpcap* C library.| It is an effort to allow python programs full access to the API provided  by the well known *libpcap* Unix C library and by its implementations  provided under Win32 systems by such packet capture systems as:  `Npcap &lt;https://nmap.org/npcap/&gt;`__,  `WinPcap &lt;https://www.winpcap.org/&gt;`__`PyPI record`_.`Documentation`_.| |package_bold| is a lightweight Python package, based on the *ctypes* library.| It is fully compliant implementation of the original C *libpcap* from  1.0.0 up to 1.9.0 API and the *WinPcap*'s 4.1.3 libpcap (1.0.0rel0b) API  by implementing whole its functionality in a clean Python instead of C.|| Useful *libpcap* API documentation can be found at:  | `Main pcap man page &lt;https://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/pcap.3pcap.html&gt;`__,  | `(MORE pcap man pages) &lt;https://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/&gt;`__|package_bold| uses the underlying *libpcap* C shared library as specified inlibpcap.cfg (system's libpcap shared library is the default), but there is alsoability to specify it programmatically by one of the following ways:.. code:: python  import libpcap  libpcap.config(LIBPCAP=None)       # system's libpcap library will be used  # or  libpcap.config(LIBPCAP=&quot;npcap&quot;)  # or  libpcap.config(LIBPCAP=&quot;wpcap&quot;)    # included wpcap library will be used  # or  libpcap.config(LIBPCAP=&quot;tcpdump&quot;)  # included tcpdump library will be used  # or                               # (currently works only for Linux x64)  libpcap.config(LIBPCAP=&quot;libpcap shared library absolute path&quot;)About original libpcap:-----------------------LIBPCAP 1.x.y by &quot;The Tcpdump Group&quot;:  https://www.tcpdump.orgAnonymous Git is available via:    git clone https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap.gitformerly from:  | Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  | Network Research Group &lt;libpcap@ee.lbl.gov&gt;  | ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/old/libpcap-0.4a7.tar.ZThis directory contains source code for libpcap, a system-independentinterface for user-level packet capture.  libpcap provides a portableframework for low-level network monitoring.  Applications includenetwork statistics collection, security monitoring, network debugging,etc.  Since almost every system vendor provides a different interfacefor packet capture, and since we've developed several tools thatrequire this functionality, we've created this system-independent APIto ease in porting and to alleviate the need for severalsystem-dependent packet capture modules in each application.Support for particular platforms and BPF:For some platforms there are README.{system} files that discuss issueswith the OS's interface for packet capture on those platforms, such ashow to enable support for that interface in the OS, if it's not built inby default.The libpcap interface supports a filtering mechanism based on thearchitecture in the BSD packet filter.  BPF is described in the 1993Winter Usenix paper &quot;The BSD Packet Filter: A New Architecture forUser-level Packet Capture&quot; (`compressed PostScript&lt;https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.ps.Z&gt;`__, `gzippedPostScript &lt;https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.ps.gz&gt;`__,`PDF &lt;https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf&gt;`__).Although most packet capture interfaces support in-kernel filtering,libpcap utilizes in-kernel filtering only for the BPF interface.On systems that don't have BPF, all packets are read into user-spaceand the BPF filters are evaluated in the libpcap library, incurringadded overhead (especially, for selective filters).  Ideally, libpcapwould translate BPF filters into a filter program that is compatiblewith the underlying kernel subsystem, but this is not yet implemented.BPF is standard in 4.4BSD, BSD/OS, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD, and macOS; an older, modified and undocumented version isstandard in AIX.  DEC OSF/1, Digital UNIX, Tru64 UNIX uses thepacketfilter interface but has been extended to accept BPF filters(which libpcap utilizes).  Also, you can add BPF filter support toUltrix using the kernel source and/or object patches.Linux has a number of BPF based systems, and libpcap does not supportany of the eBPF mechanisms as yet, although it supports many of thememory mapped receive mechanisms. See the `Linux-specific README&lt;https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/blob/master/doc/README.linux&gt;`__,for more information.Note to Linux distributions and \*BSD systems that include libpcap:There's now a rule to make a shared library, which should work on Linuxand \*BSD, among other platforms.It sets the soname of the library to &quot;libpcap.so.1&quot;; this is what itshould be, *NOT* &quot;libpcap.so.1.x&quot; or &quot;libpcap.so.1.x.y&quot; or somethingsuch as that.We've been maintaining binary compatibility between libpcap releases forquite a while; there's no reason to tie a binary linked with libpcap toa particular release of libpcap.We've been maintaining binary compatibility between libpcap releases forquite a while; there's no reason to tie a binary linked with libpcap toa particular release of libpcap.Requirements============- | It is a fully independent package.  | All necessary things are installed during the normal installation process.- ATTENTION: currently works and tested only for Windows.Installation============Prerequisites:+ Python 3.7 or higher  * https://www.python.org/  * 3.7 with C libpcap 1.8.1 is a primary test environment.+ pip and setuptools  * https://pypi.org/project/pip/  * https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/To install run:  .. parsed-literal::    python -m pip install --upgrade |package|Development===========Prerequisites:+ Development is strictly based on *tox*.
