Alternatively if you _only_ want kernel completions you can add `&quot;LSP&quot;` to the samesetting; Or add both if you like to code in hardcore mode and get no completions, or if another provider has been added.### RenameRename variables, functions and more, in both: notebooks and the file editor.Use the context menu option or the &lt;kbd&gt;F2&lt;/kbd&gt; shortcut to invoke.![rename](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter-lsp/jupyterlab-lsp/main/examples/screenshots/rename.png)### Diagnostics panelSort and jump between the diagnostics using the diagnostics panel.Open it searching for &quot;Show diagnostics panel&quot; in JupyterLab commands palette or from the context menu.Use context menu on rows in the panel to filter out diagnostics or copy their message.![panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter-lsp/jupyterlab-lsp/main/examples/screenshots/panel.png)## PrerequisitesYou will need to have both of the following installed:- JupyterLab &gt;=4.0.6,&lt;5.0.0a0- Python 3.8+In addition, if you wish to use javascript, html, markdown or any other NodeJS-based language server you will need to have appropriate NodeJS version installed.&gt; Note: Installation for JupyterLab 2.x requires a different procedure, please consult the documentation for the extension [version 2.x][version 2.x docs].## Installation&gt; For more extensive installation instructions, see the [documentation][installation-documentation].For the current stable version, the following steps are recommended.Use of a python `virtualenv` or a conda env is also recommended.1. install python 3   ```bash   conda install -c conda-forge python=3   ```1. install JupyterLab and the extensions   ```bash   conda install -c conda-forge 'jupyterlab&gt;=4.0.0,&lt;5.0.0a0' jupyterlab-lsp   # or   pip install 'jupyterlab&gt;=4.0.0,&lt;5.0.0a0' jupyterlab-lsp   ```   &gt; Note: `jupyterlab-lsp` provides both the server extension and the lab extension.   &gt; Note: With conda, you could take advantage of the bundles: `jupyter-lsp-python`   &gt; or `jupyter-lsp-r` to install both the server extension and the language server.1. install LSP servers for languages of your choice; for example, for Python   ([pylsp](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server)) and   R ([languageserver](https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver)) servers:   ```bash   pip install 'python-lsp-server[all]'   R -e 'install.packages(&quot;languageserver&quot;)'   ```   or from `conda-forge`   ```bash   conda install -c conda-forge python-lsp-server r-languageserver   ```   Please see our full list of   [supported language servers][language-servers]   which includes installation hints for the common package managers (npm/pip/conda).   In general, any LSP server from the   [Microsoft list](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/servers/)   should work after [some additional configuration](./CONTRIBUTING.md#specs).   Note: it is worth visiting the repository of each server you install as   many provide additional configuration options.1. Restart JupyterLab   If JupyterLab is running when you installed the extension, a restart is required   for the server extension and any language servers to be recognized by JupyterLab.1. (Optional, IPython users only) to improve the performance of autocompletion,   disable Jedi in IPython (the LSP servers for Python use Jedi too).   You can do that temporarily with:   ```ipython   %config Completer.use_jedi = False   ```   or permanently by setting `c.Completer.use_jedi = False` in your   [`ipython_config.py` file](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/intro.html?highlight=ipython_config.py#systemwide-configuration).1. (Optional, Linux/OSX-only) As a security measure by default Jupyter server only allows   access to files under the Jupyter root directory (the place where you launch the Jupyter server).   Thus, in order to allow `jupyterlab-lsp` to navigate to external files such as packages   installed system-wide or to libraries inside a virtual environment (`conda`,   `pip`, ...) this access control mechanism needs to be circumvented: inside your Jupyter   root directory create a symlink named _.lsp_symlink_ pointing to your system root `/`.   ```   ln -s / .lsp_symlink   ```   As this symlink is a hidden file the Jupyter server must be instructed to   serve hidden files. Either use the appropriate command line flag:   ```   jupyter lab --ContentsManager.allow_hidden=True   ```   or, alternatively, set the corresponding setting inside your `jupyter_server_config.py`.   Help in implementing a custom [`ContentsManager`](https://github.com/jupyter-lsp/jupyterlab-lsp/issues/850)   which will enable navigating to external files without the symlink is welcome.### Configuring the serversServer configurations can be edited using the Advanced Settings editor in JupyterLab (_Settings &gt; Advanced Settings Editor_). For settings specific to each server, please see the [table of language servers][language-servers]. Example settings might include:&gt; Note: for the new (currently recommended) python-lsp-server replace `pyls` occurrences with `pylsp````json{  &quot;language_servers&quot;: {    &quot;pyls&quot;: {      &quot;serverSettings&quot;: {        &quot;pyls.plugins.pydocstyle.enabled&quot;: true,        &quot;pyls.plugins.pyflakes.enabled&quot;: false,        &quot;pyls.plugins.flake8.enabled&quot;: true      }    },    &quot;r-languageserver&quot;: {      &quot;serverSettings&quot;: {        &quot;r.lsp.debug&quot;: false,        &quot;r.lsp.diagnostics&quot;: false      }    }  }}```The `serverSettings` key specifies the configurations sent to the language servers. These can be written using stringified dot accessors like above (in the VSCode style), or as nested JSON objects, e.g.:```json{  &quot;language_servers&quot;: {    &quot;pyls&quot;: {      &quot;serverSettings&quot;: {        &quot;pyls&quot;: {          &quot;plugins&quot;: {            &quot;pydocstyle&quot;: {              &quot;enabled&quot;: true            },            &quot;pyflakes&quot;: {              &quot;enabled&quot;: false            },            &quot;flake8&quot;: {              &quot;enabled&quot;: true            }          }        }      }    }  }}```#### Other configuration methodsSome language servers, such as `pyls`, provide other configuration methods _in addition_ to language-server configuration messages (accessed using the Advanced Settings Editor). For example, `pyls` allows users to configure the server using a local configuration file. You can change the inspection/diagnostics for server plugins like `pycodestyle` there.The exact configuration details will vary between operating systems (please see the [configuration section of pycodestyle documentation](https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#configuration)), but as an example, on Linux you would simply need to create a file called `~/.config/pycodestyle`, which may look like that:```cfg[pycodestyle]ignore = E402, E703max-line-length = 120```In the example above:- ignoring E402 allows imports which are not on the very top of the file,- ignoring E703 allows terminating semicolon (useful for matplotlib plots),- the maximal allowed line length is increased to 120.After changing the configuration you may need to restart the JupyterLab, and please be advised that the errors in configuration may prevent the servers from functioning properly.Again, please do check the pycodestyle documentation for specific error codes, and check the configuration of other feature providers and language servers as needed.## AcknowledgementsThis would not be possible without the fantastic initial work at[wylieconlon/lsp-editor-adapter](https://github.com/wylieconlon/lsp-editor-adapter).[language-servers]: https://jupyterlab-lsp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Language%20Servers.html[installation-documentation]: https://jupyterlab-lsp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html[version 2.x docs]: https://jupyterlab-lsp.readthedocs.io/en/2.x/Installation.html</longdescription>
