For example,sometimes the executable permission was accidentally granted, sometimes it is forgotten.This is a [Flake8][] plugin that ensures the executable permissions and shebangs of Python files arecorrectly set. Specifically, it checks the following errors:- EXE001: Shebang is present but the file is not executable.- EXE002: The file is executable but no shebang is present.- EXE003: Shebang is present but does not contain &quot;python&quot;.- EXE004: There is whitespace before shebang.- EXE005: There are blank or comment lines before shebang.## InstallationRun:    pip install flake8-executable## UsageNormally, after flake8-executable is installed, invoking flake8 will also run this plugin.
