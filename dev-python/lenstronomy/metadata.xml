Instructions forinstalling lenstronomy and its dependencies can be found in the Installation_section of the documentation.Specific instructions for settings and installation requirements for special cases that can provide speed-ups,we also refer to the Installation_ page... |PyPI| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/lenstronomy?label=PyPI&amp;logo=pypi    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lenstronomy.. |conda-forge| image:: https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/lenstronomy?logo=conda-forge    :target: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lenstronomy.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/lenstronomy/.. _conda-forge: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lenstronomy.. _Installation: https://lenstronomy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.htmlGetting started---------------The `starting guide jupyter notebook &lt;https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy-tutorials/blob/main/Notebooks/GettingStarted/starting_guide.ipynb&gt;`_leads through the main modules and design features of ``lenstronomy``. The modular design of ``lenstronomy`` allows theuser to directly access a lot of tools and each module can also be used as stand-alone packages.If you are new to gravitational lensing, check out the `mini lecture series &lt;https://github.com/sibirrer/strong_lensing_lectures&gt;`_ giving an introduction to gravitational lensingwith interactive Jupyter notebooks in the cloud.Example notebooks-----------------We have made an extension module available at `https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy-tutorials &lt;https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy-tutorials&gt;`_.You can find simple example notebooks for various cases. The latest versions of the notebooks should be compatible with the recent pip version of lenstronomy.Affiliated packages-------------------Multiple affiliated packages that make use of lenstronomy can be found `here &lt;https://lenstronomy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/affiliatedpackages.html&gt;`_(not complete) and further packages are under development by the community.Mailing list and Slack channel------------------------------You can join the ``lenstronomy`` mailing list by signing up on the`google groups page &lt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lenstronomy&gt;`_.The email list is meant to provide a communication platform between users and developers. You can ask questions,and suggest new features. New releases will be announced via this mailing list.We also have a `Slack channel &lt;https://lenstronomers.slack.com&gt;`_ for the community.Please send us an `email &lt;lenstronomy-dev@googlegroups.com&gt;`_ such that we can add you to the channel.If you encounter errors or problems with ``lenstronomy``, please let us know!Contribution------------Check out the `contributing page &lt;https://lenstronomy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html&gt;`_and become an author of ``lenstronomy``! A big shout-out to the current `list of contributors and developers &lt;https://lenstronomy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/authors.html&gt;`_!Attribution-----------The design concept of ``lenstronomy`` is reported by `Birrer &amp; Amara 2018 &lt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09746v1&gt;`_ and is based on `Birrer et al 2015 &lt;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...813..102B&gt;`_.The current JOSS software publication is presented by `Birrer et al. 2021 &lt;https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03283&gt;`_.Please cite `Birrer &amp; Amara 2018 &lt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09746v1&gt;`_ and `Birrer et al. 2021 &lt;https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03283&gt;`_ when you use lenstronomy in a publication and link to `https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy &lt;https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy&gt;`_.Please also cite `Birrer et al 2015 &lt;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...813..102B&gt;`_when you make use of the ``lenstronomy`` work-flow or the Shapelet source reconstruction and make sure to cite alsothe relevant work that was implemented in ``lenstronomy``, as described in the release paper and the documentation.Don't hesitate to reach out to the developers if you have questions!</longdescription>
