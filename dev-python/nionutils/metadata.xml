Thecode is available under the Apache License, Version 2.0.Requirements------------Requires Python 3.8 or later.Getting Help and Contributing-----------------------------If you find a bug, please file an issue on GitHub. You can also contactus directly at swift@nion.com.This is primarily a library focused on providing support to higher levelNion Python libraries. If you are using this in your own project, wewill accept bug fixes and minor feature improvements via pull requests.For larger features or additions, please contact us to discuss.This library includes some direct tests, but is also tested via otherNion Python projects. Any contribution will need to pass the entiresuite of tests. New contributions should be submitted with new tests.Summary of Features-------------------Events~~~~~~Events can be used by objects to notify other objects when something ofinterest occurs. The source object &quot;fires&quot; the event, optionally passingparameters, and the &quot;listener&quot; receives a function call. The sourceobject determines when to fire an event. The event can have multiplelisteners. The listeners are called synchronously in the order in whichthey are added, and the source can fire unconditionally, or until alistener returns True or False... code:: python    from nion.utils import Event    class Telescope:      def __init__(self):        self.new_planet_detected_event = Event.Event()      def on_external_event(self, coordinates):        self.new_planet_detected_event.fire(coordinates)    def handle_new_planet(coordinates):      print(&quot;New planet coordinates at &quot; + str(coordinates))    telescope = Telescope()    listener = telescope.new_planet_detected_event.listen(handle_new_planet)    listener.close()  # when finishedObservable~~~~~~~~~~The Observable based class defines five basic events for watching fordirect changes to an object such as a property changing, an object beingset or cleared, or an item being inserted or removed from a list. Theobservable is used along with events to implement bindings... code:: python    from nion.utils import Observable    class MyClass(Observable.Observable):      def __init__(self):        self.__weight = 1.0      @property      def weight(self):        return self.__weight      @weight.setter      def weight(self, new_weight):        self.__weight = new_weight        self.notify_property_changed(&quot;weight&quot;)    myc = MyClass()    def property_changed(key):      if key == &quot;weight&quot;:        print(&quot;The weight changed &quot; + str(myc.weight))    listener = myc.property_changed_event.listen(property_changed)    listener.close()  # when finishedBindings, Converters, Models~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Bindings connect a value in a source object to a value in a targetobject. Bindings can be one way bindings from source to target, or twoway bindings from source to target and from target to source. Bindingscan bind property values, lists, or an item in a tuple between thesource and target. Bindings work using the Observable events andsubsequently are implemented via Events.Bindings can optionally make value conversions between the source andtarget. For instance, a binding between a float property and a userinterface text field will need to convert from float to string and back.Converters between value and strings are included for integer, float,percentage, check state, and UUID to strings.Geometry~~~~~~~~Classes for integer and float based points, sizes, and rectangles areincluded. Additional geometry routines are also included, for instance:line midpoint.Persistence~~~~~~~~~~~The PersistentObject based class defines a basic structure for storingobjects and their relationship to each other into a persistent storagecontext. PersistentObjects can store basic properties, single objects(to-one relationship) and lists of objects (to-many relationship).Subclasses must strictly notify the PersistentObject of changes to theirpersistent data and follow certain guidelines. Doing so allows theobject to be stored persistently and restored from persistent storage.Properties in the PersistentObject can have validators, converters,change notifications, and more. Items and relationships have changenotifications and more.The PersistentStorageContext defines an interfaces which manages acollection of PersistentObjects. It must be able to store a simple dictstructure for properties, items, and lists.Process, Threads~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Process defines classes to facilitate a threaded queue, which executesits items serially, and thread set which executes the most recent itemin the set.ThreadPool defines a threaded dispatcher with the ability to limitdispatch frequency and a thread pool with the ability to executeexplicitly without threads for testing.Publish and Subscribe~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Publish and subscribe implements a basic publish and subscribemechanism. It is should be considered experimental and is notrecommended for use.Reference Counting~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The ReferenceCounted base class provides an explicitly reference countedobject that is unique from regular Python reference counting in that itprovides precise control of when the reference is acquired and released.The about\_to\_delete method is called when reference count reacheszero.Stream~~~~~~The Stream classes provide a async-based stream of values that can becontrolled using standard reactive operators such as sample, debounce,and combine. The stream source is an Event named value\_stream and thesource object must provide both the value\_stream and a value property.Structured Model~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Structured Model classes provide a way to describe a data structurewhich can produce a modifiable and observable object to be used as amodel for other utility classes such as binding and events.</longdescription>
