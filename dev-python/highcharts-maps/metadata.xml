If you are building a web or mobile app/dashboard that will be visualizing data in some fashion, you should absolutely take a look at the Highcharts suite of solutions. Take a peak at some fantastic `demo visualizations &lt;https://www.highcharts.com/demo/maps&gt;`__.As a suite of JavaScript libraries, `Highcharts &lt;https://www.highcharts.com&gt;`__ is written in JavaScript, and is used to configure and render data visualizations in aweb browser (or other JavaScript-executing) environment. As a set of JavaScriptlibraries, its audience is JavaScript developers. But what about the broader ecosystem ofPython developers and data scientists?Given Python's increasing adoption as the technology of choice for data science and forthe backends of leading enterprise-grade applications, Python is often the backend that delivers data and content to the front-end...which then renders it using JavaScript and HTML.There are numerous Python frameworks (Django, Flask, Tornado, etc.) with specificcapabilities to simplify integration with Javascript frontend frameworks (React, Angular,VueJS, etc.). But facilitating that with Highcharts has historically been very difficult.Part of this difficulty is because the Highcharts JavaScript suite - while supporting JSON as aserialization/deserialization format - leverages JavaScript object literals to expose thefull power and interactivity of its data visualizations. And while it's easy to serializeJSON from Python, serializing and deserializing to/from JavaScript object literal notationis much more complicated. This means that Python developers looking to integrate with Highcharts typically had to either invest a lot of effort, or were only able to leverage a small portion of Highcharts' rich functionality.So we wrote the **Highcharts for Python Toolkit** to bridge that gap.**Highcharts for Python** provides Python object representation for *all* of theJavaScript objects defined in the`Highcharts (JavaScript) API &lt;https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/&gt;`__. It provides automatic data validation, and exposes simple and standardized methods for serializing those Pythonobjects back-and-forth to JavaScript object literal notation.**Highcharts Maps for Python** in particular provides support forthe `Highcharts Maps &lt;https://www.highcharts.com/products/maps/&gt;`__ extension, which isdesigned to provide extensive map and data visualization capabilities optimized forGIS (Geographic Information System) data visualization, withrobust interactivity. For ease of use, it also includes the full functionality of`Highcharts Core for Python &lt;https://core-docs.highchartspython.com&gt;`__ as well.Key Highcharts Maps for Python Features==============================================* **Clean and consistent API**. No reliance on &quot;hacky&quot; code, ``dict``  and JSON serialization, or impossible to maintain / copy-pasted &quot;spaghetti code&quot;.* **Comprehensive Highcharts support**. Every single Highcharts chart type and every  single configuration option is supported in **Highcharts Maps for Python**. This  includes the over 70 data visualization types supported by  `Highcharts Core &lt;https://www.highcharts.com/product/highcharts/&gt;`__ and the four  core map visualizations available in   `Highcharts Maps &lt;https://www.highcharts.com/product/maps/&gt;`__.    Every Highcharts for Python library provides full support for the rich JavaScript   formatter (JS callback functions) capabilities that are often needed to get the most   out of Highcharts' visualization and interaction capabilities.  .. note::    **See also:**        * `Supported Visualizations &lt;https://maps-docs.highchartspython.com/en/latest/visualizations.html&gt;`__* **Simple JavaScript Code Generation**. With one method call, produce production-ready  JavaScript code to render your interactive visualizations using Highcharts' rich  capabilities.* **Easy Chart Download**. With one method call, produce high-end static  visualizations that can be downloaded or shared as files with your audience. Produce  static charts using the Highsoft-provided **Highcharts Export Server**, or using your   own private export server as needed.* **Asynchronous Map Data Retrieval**. To minimize the amount of data transferred over  the wire, **Highcharts Maps for Python** has built-in support for the configuration of  asynchronous client-side retrieval of your map data.* **Automatic TopoJSON Optimization**. To minimize the amount of data transferred over  the wire, **Highcharts Maps for Python** automatically converts your  map geometries to highly-efficient TopoJSON topologies while  still allowing you to work with GeoJSON data if you choose to.* **Integration with GeoPandas, Pandas, and PySpark**. With two lines of code, produce a  high-end interactive visualization of your GeoPandas, Pandas, or PySpark dataframes.* **Consistent code style**. For Python developers, switching between Pythonic code  conventions and JavaScript code conventions can be...annoying. So  the Highcharts for Python toolkit applies Pythonic syntax with automatic conversion between  Pythonic ``snake_case`` notation and JavaScript ``camelCase`` styles.|**Highcharts Maps for Python** vs Alternatives===================================================For a discussion of **Highcharts Maps for Python** in comparison to alternatives, please seethe **COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION:** https://maps-docs.highchartspython.com/en/latest/index.html---------------------********************************Hello World, and Basic Usage********************************1. Import Highcharts Maps for Python==========================================.. code-block:: python  # PRECISE IMPORT PATTERN    # This method of importing Highcharts Maps for Python objects yields the fastest  # performance for the import statement. However, it is more verbose and requires  # you to navigate the extensive Highcharts Maps for Python API.  # Import classes using precise module indications. For example:  from highcharts_maps.chart import Chart  from highcharts_maps.global_options.shared_options import SharedMapsOptions  from highcharts_maps.options import HighchartsMapsOptions  from highcharts_maps.options.plot_options.map import MapOptions  from highcharts_maps.options.series.map import MapSeries  # CATCH-ALL IMPORT PATTERN  # This method of importing Highcharts Maps for Python classes has relatively slow  # performance because it imports hundreds of different classes from across the entire  # library. This is also a known anti-pattern, as it obscures the namespace within the  # library. Both may be acceptable to you in your use-case, but do use at your own risk.  # Import objects from the catch-all &quot;.highcharts&quot; module.  from highcharts_maps import highcharts  # You can now access specific classes without individual import statements.  highcharts.Chart  highcharts.SharedMapsOptions  highcharts.HighchartsMapsOptions  highcharts.MapOptions  highcharts.MapSeries2. Create Your Chart================================  .. code-block:: python    # from a primitive array, using keyword arguments    my_chart = Chart(data = [[1, 23], [2, 34], [3, 45]],                      series_type = 'line')    # from a primitive array, using the .from_array() method    my_chart = Chart.from_array([[1, 23], [2, 34], [3, 45]],                                 series_type = 'line')    # from a Numpy ndarray, using keyword arguments    my_chart = Chart(data = numpy_array, series_type = 'line')    # from a Numpy ndarray, using the .from_array() method    my_chart = Chart.from_array(data = numpy_array, series_type = 'line')    # from a JavaScript file    my_chart = Chart.from_js_literal('my_js_literal.js')    # from a JSON file    my_chart = Chart.from_json('my_json.json')    # from a Python dict    my_chart = Chart.from_dict(my_dict_obj)    # from a Pandas dataframe    my_chart = Chart.from_pandas(df)    # from a PySpark dataframe    my_chart = Chart.from_pyspark(df,                                  property_map = {                                      'x': 'transactionDate',                                      'y': 'invoiceAmt',                                      'id': 'id'                                  },                                  series_type = 'line')    # from a CSV    my_chart = Chart.from_csv('/some_file_location/filename.csv')    # from a HighchartsOptions configuration object    my_chart = Chart.from_options(my_options)    # from a Series configuration, using keyword arguments    my_chart = Chart(series = my_series)    # from a Series configuration, using .from_series()    my_chart = Chart.from_series(my_series)3.
