	<longdescription>The Blue Brain Python E-feature extraction Library (BluePyEfe) aims at easing the process of reading experimental recordings and extracting batches of electrical features from them. To do so, it combines trace reading functions and features extraction functions from the eFel library. BluePyEfe outputs protocols and features files in a format that can then be used by BluePyOpt for electrical model building purposes.</longdescription>
