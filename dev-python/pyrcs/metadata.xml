This tool is intended for those people, such as researchers and practitioners, that currently either use that website or work with the UK's railway codes and who are interested in using the Python programming language to facilitate access to, and manipulation of, data relating to railway codes.The `installation &lt;https://pyrcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html&gt;`_ of PyRCS includes a set of pre-packed data. When users request data of a category that is specified on the `Railway Codes`_ website, the pre-packed data of the category is loaded by default. Beyond that, it also offers capabilities to directly access the most up-to-date data on the data source website, and update the relevant pre-packed data as well... _`Railway Codes`: http://www.railwaycodes.org.uk/index.shtmlInstallation############To install the latest release of pyrcs from `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pyrcs/&gt;`_ via `pip &lt;https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip/&gt;`_:.. code-block:: bash   pip install --upgrade pyrcs**Note:** For more information, please also refer to `Installation &lt;https://pyrcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html&gt;`_.Documentation#############The full PyRCS documentation (including detailed examples and a quick-start tutorial) is hosted on `ReadTheDocs &lt;https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyrcs/&gt;`_: [`PDF &lt;https://pyrcs.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/&gt;`_] [`HTML &lt;https://pyrcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_].License#######PyRCS is licensed under `GNU General Public License v3 &lt;https://github.com/mikeqfu/pyrcs/blob/master/LICENSE&gt;`_ or later (GPLv3+).Cite as#######Fu, Q.
