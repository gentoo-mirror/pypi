	<longdescription># tiledb_jupyter_bioimg![Github Actions Status](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Jupyter-BioImage-Viewer/workflows/Build/badge.svg)A jupyterlab extension to visualize bioimages in TileDB format## Requirements* JupyterLab &gt;= 3.0## Install```bashpip install tiledb_jupyter_bioimg```## Contributing### Development installNote: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.```bash# Clone the repo to your local environment# Change directory to the tiledb_jupyter_bioimg directory# Install package in development modepip install -e .# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLabjupyter labextension develop . --overwrite# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changesjlpm run build```You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.```bash# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when neededjlpm run watch# Run JupyterLab in another terminaljupyter lab```With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).By default, the `jlpm run build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:```bashjupyter lab build --minimize=False```### Uninstall```bashpip uninstall tiledb_jupyter_bioimg```### Usage```pythonfrom tiledb_jupyter_bioimg import RenderRender(&quot;&lt;&lt;NAMESPACE&gt;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;&lt;GROUP_ID&gt;&gt;&quot;, {&quot;token&quot;: &quot;&lt;&lt;TILEDB_API_TOKEN&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;})```### Common issuesIf you get error `Uncaught (in promise) Error: No provider for: jupyter.extensions.jupyterWidgetRegistry.` please make sure you are using correct version of `ipywidgets` (v8).</longdescription>
