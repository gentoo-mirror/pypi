	<longdescription>Flask-Login    -----------    Flask-Login provides user session management for Flask. It handles the    common tasks of logging in, logging out, and remembering your users'    sessions over extended periods of time.    Flask-Login is not bound to any particular database system or permissions    model. The only requirement is that your user objects implement a few    methods, and that you provide a callback to the extension capable of    loading users from their ID.
