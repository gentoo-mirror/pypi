Example &quot;Class hierarchy example&quot;    === &quot;Subclass tree&quot;        ```py        from prettyqt import itemmodels, widgets        app = widgets.app()        widget = widgets.TreeView()        model = itemmodels.SubClassTreeModel(core.AbstractItemModelMixin)        widget.set_model(model)        widget.show()        ```        &lt;figure markdown&gt;          ![Image title](images/abstractitemmodelmixin_subclasses.png)          &lt;figcaption&gt;AbstractitemModelMixin subclasses&lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;    === &quot;Parentclass tree&quot;        ```py        from prettyqt import itemmodels, widgets        app = widgets.app()        widget = widgets.TreeView()        model = itemmodels.ParentClassTreeModel(widgets.TreeWidget)        widget.set_model(model)        widget.show()        ```        &lt;figure markdown&gt;          ![Image title](images/treewidget_parentclasses.png)          &lt;figcaption&gt;TreeWidget parent classes&lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;    === &quot;MRO tree&quot;        ```py        from prettyqt import itemmodels, widgets        app = widgets.app()        widget = widgets.TreeView()        model = itemmodels.ParentClassTreeModel(widgets.TreeWidget, mro=True)        widget.set_model(model)        widget.show()        ```        &lt;figure markdown&gt;          ![Image title](images/treewidget_mro.png)          &lt;figcaption&gt;TreeWidget MRO&lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;Main objective is to make Qt feel &quot;pythonic&quot;. Qt is originally a C++ Framework,and using it can be quite cumbersome for Python developers. (very restrictive when it comes to types,very OOP-centric, lot of enum use, snakeCase naming etc.) PrettyQt aims to improve this by:- adding more powerful methods to the classes, which accept more types and have more options (in form of keyword arguments)- doing [type conversions](types.md) for method parameters to lessen the strictness for types.- raising Exceptions or returning `None` instead of returning `-1` or invalid objects.- all enum getters/setters also work with strings. Everything typed with Literals for an excellent IDE experience. (Example: )- adding a lot of `__dunder__` methods to the classes to make them behave like good python citizens.The minimum supported python version is 3.10.The minimum supported Qt version is 6.5The aim is to support the last two released Python versions as well as keeping support for the last Qt LTS release.## Covered Qt modules{%   include-markdown &quot;module_overview.md&quot;%}[Read more](general.md) about the general API design.Apart from the mentioned mixin tree and the corresponding classes, this library alsocontains a lot of custom widgets, delegates, eventfilters, validators,syntaxhighlighters, layouts, models, proxy models and much more.Converting to PrettyQt should be very straightforward since the original behaviour of theQt classes didnt change for the largest parts and all methods from base Qt modulesare still available. (There might be a few constructors with slightly different behaviour though.)Interested? Take a look at the documentation! (even though it totally sucks in its current state.)## Where to get itThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:https://github.com/phil65/PrettyQtThe latest released version are available at the [Pythonpackage index](https://pypi.org/project/prettyqt).```sh# or PyPIpip install prettyqt```## Dependencies```python exec=&quot;on&quot;from prettyqt import prettyqtmarkdowntable = prettyqtmarkdown.DependencyTable(&quot;prettyqt&quot;)print(table)```## Installation from sourcesThis project uses poetry for dependency management and packaging. Install this first.In the `prettyqt` directory (same one where you found this file aftercloning the git repo), execute:```shpoetry install```## License[MIT](LICENSE)## Contributing to prettyqt [![Open Source Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/phil65/prettyqt/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/phil65/prettyqt)All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome!</longdescription>
