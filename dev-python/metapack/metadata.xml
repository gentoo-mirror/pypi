Metatab files look exactly likeyou'd expect, so they are very easy for non-technical users to read and edit,using tools they already have. Metatab is an excellent format for creating,storing and transmitting metadata. For more information about metatab, visithttp://metatab.org.Metapack is a packaging system that uses Metatab to create Zip, Excel andfilesystem data packages.This repository has a Python module and executable. For a Javascript version,see the `metatab-js &lt;https://github.com/CivicKnowledge/metatab-js&gt;`_ repository.See the `documentation for full details &lt;http://docs.metatab.org/&gt;`_Install-------Metapack requires geographic libraries, most importantly gda, pyproj, shapelyand geopandas. These libraries can be difficult to install, often requiringcompilation. By far, the easiest way to install them properly is with Anaconda.And, because, metapack has a lot of dependencies, you'll want to install it ina virtual environment. Metapack only works with Python 3.5 or later:.. code-block:: bash    $ conda create --name metapack python=3.7    $ conda activate metapack    $ conda install numpy pandas gdal geos pyproj=1.9.5.1 fiona shapely geopandas    $ pip install metapackVerify that the install worked by running `` mp config``Getting Started---------------See `Getting Started&lt;https://github.com/CivicKnowledge/metatab-py/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.rst&gt;`_ for an initial tutorial, or the other guides in the `docs directory onGithub &lt;https://github.com/CivicKnowledge/metatab-py/tree/master/docs&gt;`_Development Notes-----------------Clearing the Cache++++++++++++++++++Some tests can pass despite errors if the file the test is looking for iscached. The cache can be set with an evironmental variable and cleared beforethe tests to solve this problem.. code-block:: bash    $ cache_dir=/tmp/some/dir    $ rm -rf $cache_dir    $ mkdir -p  $cache_dir    $ APPURL_CACHE=$cache_dir python setup.py testDevelopment Testing with Docker+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Testing during development for other versions of Python is a bit of a pain,since you have to install the alternate version, and Tox will run all of thetests, not just the one you want.One way to deal with this is to install Docker locally, then run the dockertest container on the source directory. This is done automatically from theMakefile in appurl/tests.. code-block:: bash    $ cd metapack/metapack/test    $ make build # to create the container image    $ make shell # to run bash the containerYou now have a docker container where the /code directory is the appurl sourcedir. Since the Docker container is running code from your host machine, you canedit it normally.Now, run tox to build the tox virtual environments, then enter the specificversion you want to run tests for and activate the virtual environment.To run one environment. for example, Python 3.4.. code-block:: bash    # tox -e py34To run one test in one environment environment. for example, Python 3.4.. code-block:: bash    # tox -e py34 -- -s</longdescription>
