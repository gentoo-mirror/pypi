	<longdescription># AutoML Sphinx ThemeThe goal of this repository is to set up a documentation as fast and as clean as possible. In yoursource project you only need to install `automl_sphinx_theme` to get all the features you need.Those include automatic API generation, beautiful theme, numpy docstring interpretation, andexecuting/plotting examples.&lt;b&gt;NO COMPLICATED `.conf` OR SPHINX KNOWLEDGE ARE NECESSARY!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:sparkling_heart: You're welcome. :sparkling_heart:## Installation- Include `name`, `version`, `author`, `copyright` in `{PACKAGE_NAME}/__init__.py`.- Copy the `docs` and `examples` directories to your root folder. You don't have to include allfiles but you should at least include `docs/conf.py` and `docs/Makefile`.- In `docs/conf.py` change `src` to `{PACKAGE_NAME}`. Adapt the file if needed.- Install this repo via pypi:```pip install automl_sphinx_theme```- You can generate the docs via `make html` inside the docs directory. Have a look inside the`Makefile` to get more information and commands.We recommend using the repository `automl_template` which incorporates `automl_sphinx_theme`automatically.## GithubThe documentation can be pushed automatically to a branch, which is used to display a webpage.Follow the steps to enable it:- Copy `.github/workflows/docs.yml` to you root folder.- Create a new branch called `gh-pages`.- Go to `settings &gt; pages` and select `gh-pages` as source.## Version SwitchingAutoML Sphinx Theme provides the user to link older versions of documentations (must be done manually!). Specify ``versions`` in the options to enable it. We recommend setting up a Github workflow which automatically pushes the latest tag to the gh-pages. From there, you could link the version directly.## Customization- Logo: Add docs/images/logo.png.- Favicon: Add docs/images/favicon.ico.</longdescription>
