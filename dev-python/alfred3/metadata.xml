In its coreversion, alfred3 comes well-equipped for the creation of dynamiccontent that can be delivered online via a webserver or offline runningon local machines. In addition, the [alfred3-interactplugin](https://github.com/jobrachem/alfred3-interact) enables users tocreate interactive group experiments with features such as automatedgroup forming, quick access to members' experiment data, and aprepacked chat functionality.Further advantages include:* All alfred3 scripts are written in [Python  3](https://www.python.org/), a very popular open source programming  language that is easy to learn and fast to develop with, as it  focuses on code readability. Thus, even minimal programming skills  are sufficient to create experiments with alfred3 (see the  requirement section for more details and suggestions on beginner  tutorials).* Alfred3 uses the principle of Object-oriented programming (OOP) to  maximize code reusability. By simply copying and pasting elements  between scripts, users can instantly integrate content from previous  experiments with their current project.* Experimenters can share experiments created with alfred3 the same way  they share code from their data analysis. In addition to highly  reusable code, transparency and ease of sharing are two key  advantages of using script-based experimental software.* Using open source software is a core principle of Open Science and  both Python 3 and alfred3 are published under permissive open source  licenses. Researchers will not face the hurdles associated with  closed source software when trying to reproduce an alfred3 experiment  (see [The Open Science Training  Handbook](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/open-science-basics/open-research-software-and-open-source)  for more information on the importance of using open source research  software for your experiments and data analyses).* Online experiments written in alfred3 support all types of mobile  devices through a responsive interface, making them suitable for a wide range of applications and settings (e.g., laboratory experiments where users are invited to bring their own devices, or surveying passers-py with tablets in public spaces)* Alfred3 is optimized for the collection of personal data in full  compliance with both the GDPR and official German guidelines on data  management in psychological science ([English  version](https://www.dgps.de/fileadmin/documents/Empfehlungen/Data_Management_eng.pdf)  | [German  version](https://www.dgps.de/fileadmin/documents/Empfehlungen/Datenmanagement_deu.pdf)).  The core version of alfred3 already includes data encryption and  decryption methods as well as unlinked storage options for personal or  sensitive data (meaning that you can store personal data separately  without the possibility of linking it back to experimental data).## InstallationIf you have Python 3.7 or newer installed, just install alfred3 via pip```$ pip3 install alfred3```## DocumentationDocumentation and tutorials for alfred3's most important featuresis available here: [Link to docs](https://alfredo3.psych.bio.uni-goettingen.de/docs/)## Questions and AnswersWe use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ctreffe/alfred/discussions/categories/q-a).You can ask questions, share ideas, and showcase your work there. Do nothesitate to ask!## A &quot;Hello, world&quot; experimentCreating a hello-world experiment is as easy as writing this *script.py*file. You can even do it in a simple text editor. Note that the filemust be named ``script.py`````pythonimport alfred3 as alexp = al.Experiment()exp += al.Page(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;, name=&quot;hello_world&quot;)```To run the script, open a terminal and change the working directory toyour experiment directory:```$ cd path/to/experiment```Next, simply execute the following command in the terminal::```$ alfred3 run```If you have *Google Chrome* installed on your machine, a browser windowwith the experiment opens automatically. Otherwise, open any webbrowserand visit ``http://127.0.0.1:5000/start`` to start the experiment.Of course, this &quot;Hello, world&quot; experiment does not contain much content:Only a single page with a heading. To learn how to add content to anexperiment, visit our tutorials in the [alfred3 documentation](https://alfredo3.psych.bio.uni-goettingen.de/docs/).## Citation**If you are publishing research conducted using alfred3, thefollowing citation is required:**&gt;Treffenstaedt, C., Brachem, J., &amp; Wiemann, P.
