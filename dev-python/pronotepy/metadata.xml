It mainly focuses on student accounts but has limited support for teacher accounts as well.This project does **not** use the official HYPERPLANNING API provided by PRONOTE, which is inaccessible to students.## About### Dependencies - pycryptodome - beautifulsoup4 - requests - autoslot### Installation#### StableInstall directly from pypi using pip: `pip install -U pronotepy`&gt; **Note**&gt; If you are on Windows and have trouble with this command, use `py -3 -m pip install pronotepy`. You must have Python 3 installed on your machine.#### LatestYou can install the latest version by installing directly from the repository:`pip install -U git+https://github.com/bain3/pronotepy`We cannot assure that the latest version will be working, but it might have features or bugfixes that are not yet released on pypi.### Testing the packageTo self test pronotepy run this command:`python -m pronotepy.test_pronotepy`*Please keep in mind that this uses the demo version of pronote and so it can't test every function.*### Usage&gt; **Warning**&gt;&gt; The usage part of this readme is for the latest version. If you are installing from pypi, please see the documentation linked at the beginning.Here is an example script (homework shown in example.py):```pythonimport pronotepy# initialise the client# Note: the address should be a direct one (like the one below) usually the address shown by your school just redirects# you to the real one.# Ex.: https://your-school.com/pronote/students &lt;-- BAD#      https://0000000a.index-education.net/pronote/eleve.html &lt;-- GOOD#      https://0000000a.index-education.net/pronote/eleve.html?login=true &lt;-- ONLY IF YOU HAVE AN ENT AND YOU KNOW YOUR IDS, ELSE REFER TO ENT PART OF READMEclient = pronotepy.Client('https://demo.index-education.net/pronote/eleve.html',                          username='demonstration',                          password='pronotevs')if client.logged_in: # check if client successfully logged in    # get the all the periods (may return multiple types like trimesters and semesters but it doesn't really matter    # the api will get it anyway)    periods = client.periods    for period in periods:        for grade in period.grades:  # iterate over all the grades            print(f'{grade.grade}/{grade.out_of}')  # print out the grade in this style: 20/20```For any extra details, please see the documentation linked above.### QR CodePronotepy allows you to connect with the Pronote QR code. Pass in the function the contents of the QR code and the confirmation code```pythonimport pronotepy# creating the client from qrcode_loginclient = pronotepy.Client.qrcode_login({&quot;jeton&quot;:&quot;&lt;LONG_TOKEN&gt;&quot;,                                        &quot;login&quot;:&quot;&lt;SHORT_TOKEN&gt;&quot;,                                        &quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://0000000a.index-education.net/pronote/mobile.eleve.html&quot;},                                        &quot;1234&quot;)```### ENTPronotepy has builtin functions for getting cookies from some ENTs (if you want your ENT to be added make a new issue).You can pass those functions to the client like this:```pythonimport pronotepyfrom pronotepy.ent import occitanie_montpellier# creating the client and passing the occitanie_montpellier function to automatically get cookies from ENTclient = pronotepy.Client('https://0000000a.index-education.net/pronote/eleve.html',                          username='demonstration',                          password='pronotevs',                          ent=occitanie_montpellier)# check if sucessfully logged inif client.logged_in:    print(len(client.discussions())) # printing number of messages that the user haselse:    print('no login')```All the functions return cookies needed to connect to pronote (use docs to see if your ENT is supported).## ContributingFeel free to contribute anything.
