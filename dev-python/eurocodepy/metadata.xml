	<longdescription># eurocodepy v0.1.31EurocodePy is a Python package for calculating structures according to Eurocodes. It provides a collection of functions that enable engineers to design and analyze structures based on the Eurocode standards. In addition, it includes a database of structural materials and steel profiles, making it easy to design and analyze structures according to Eurocode standards.There are also some functions to work with material properties:* creep_coef* shrink_strainThe **utils** package has some functions that can be useful:* stress: calculate the principal stresses and vectors, and the stress inavariants (I1, J2, J3, ...)## InstallationYou can install EurocodePy using pip by running the following command:```shellpip install eurocodepy```Too upgrade to the latest version use:```shellpip install eurocodepy --upgrade```## UsageEurocodePy provides a range of functions for designing and analyzing structures according to Eurocodes. Here are some examples:from eurocodepy import ec2## Materials and Profiles DatabaseEurocodePy includes a database of structural materials and steel profiles. The database is stored in a JSON file and can be easily updated or extended. The materials database includes properties such as the density, modulus of elasticity, and Poisson's ratio, while the steel profiles database includes properties such as the cross-sectional area, moment of inertia, and section modulus.The database is stored in a JSON file 'eurocodes.json'. This file is loaded when the package is impoorted, soo you can modified it to include you own properties. If you have some suggestions or materials to add to the database and want them to be included for all the coommunity, please contribute as described below in the [contributions](#contributing) section. Steel profiles arre stored in a separate file 'prof_euro.json'The database can be accessed through a dictionary. There are also some aliases to easily access the database. The following code gives examples on how to use it.```Pythonimport eurocodepy as ec# To access the entire databasedb = ec.db# To access concrete class C30/37conc = ec.db[&quot;Materials&quot;][&quot;Concrete&quot;][&quot;Classes&quot;][&quot;C30/37&quot;] # Alternative 1conc = ec.Materials[&quot;Concrete&quot;][&quot;Classes&quot;][&quot;C30/37&quot;] # Alternative 2conc = ec.Concrete[&quot;Classes&quot;][&quot;C30/37&quot;] # Alternative 3conc = ec.ConcreteClasses[&quot;C30/37&quot;] # Alternative 4# to access a steel profileipe200 = ec.SteelProfiles[&quot;I_SECTION&quot;][&quot;IPE200]```Current materials in the database are:* concrete (C20/25 to C90/105)* timber (C14 to C24, D18, GL24 to 36)* reinforcement - general (B400, B450, B500, B550, B600, B700, classes A, B and C: B400A etc.)* reinforcement - portuguese (A400NR, A400NRSD, A500NR, A500NRSD, A500ER, A500EL)* structural steel (S235, S275, S355, S450)Available european steel profiles are:* I sections (IPE, HEA, HEB, HEM)* L sections* C sections* T sections* Pipe sections* Box sections* Double L sections* Double C sections## DocumentationA more or less complete description of existing packages and modules can be found on [eurocodepy.readthedocs.io](https://eurocodepy.readthedocs.io)## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
