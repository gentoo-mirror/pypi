	<longdescription># Buildkite Test Collector for Python (Beta)The official Python adapter for [Buildkite Test Analytics](https://buildkite.com/test-analytics) which collects information about your tests.**Supported python versions:** &gt;=3.8âš’ **Supported test frameworks:** pytest.ðŸ“¦ **Supported CI systems:** Buildkite, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and others via the `BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_*` environment variables.## ðŸ‘‰ Installing1. [Create a test suite](https://buildkite.com/docs/test-analytics), and copy the API token that it gives you.2. Add `buildkite-test-collector` to your list of dev dependencies in `setup.py````python        extras_require={            &quot;dev&quot;: [                &quot;buildkite-test-collector&quot;            ]        }```3. Set up your API tokenAdd the `BUIDLKITE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN` environment variable to your build system's environment.4. Run your testsRun your tests like normal.  Note that we attempt to detect the presence of several common CI environments, however if this fails you can set the `CI` environment variable to any value and it will work.```sh$ pytest```5. Verify that it worksIf all is well, you should see the test run in the test analytics section of the Buildkite dashboard.## ðŸŽ¢ TracingBuildkite Test Analytics has support for tracing potentially slow operations within your tests (SQL queries, HTTP requests, etc).  This library now supports the ability to add tracing information to your test analytics output by using the new `spans` pytest fixture.  See the `SpanCollector` documentation for more information.## ðŸ”œ RoadmapSee the [GitHub 'enhancement' issues](https://github.com/buildkite/test-collector-python/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) for planned features. Pull requests are always welcome, and weâ€™ll give you feedback and guidance if you choose to contribute ðŸ’š## âš’ DevelopingAfter cloning the repository, install the dependencies:```pip install -e '.[dev]'```And run the tests:```pytest```Useful resources for developing collectors include the [Buildkite Test Analytics docs](https://buildkite.com/docs/test-analytics) and the [RSpec and Minitest collectors](https://github.com/buildkite/rspec-buildkite-analytics).## ðŸ‘©ðŸ’» ContributingBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/buildkite/test-collector-python## ðŸš€ Releasing1. Version bump the code, tag and push.2. Publish to the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/):```shpython3 -m buildpython3 -m twine upload dist/*```3. Create a [new github release](https://github.com/buildkite/test-collector-python/releases).## ðŸ“œ LicenseThe package is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).## ðŸ¤™ ThanksThanks to the folks at [Alembic](https://alembic.com.au/) for building and maintaining this package.</longdescription>
