	<longdescription># SARplusSimple Algorithm for Recommendation (SAR) is a neighborhood basedalgorithm for personalized recommendations based on user transactionhistory. SAR recommends items that are most **similar** to the onesthat the user already has an existing **affinity** for. Two items are**similar** if the users that interacted with one item are also likelyto have interacted with the other. A user has an **affinity** to anitem if they have interacted with it in the past.SARplus is an efficient implementation of this algorithm for Spark.More details can be found at[sarplus@microsoft/recommenders](https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/tree/main/contrib/sarplus).</longdescription>
