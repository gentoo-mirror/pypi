	<longdescription>## Typing stubs for redisThis is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `redis` package. Itcan be used by type-checking tools like[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses`redis`. The source for this package can be found athttps://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/redis. All fixes fortypes and metadata should be contributed there.Note: Redis-py 5.0.0 added a py.typed file, but the inline annotations are incomplete. Continuing to use `types-redis` for the time being may lead to superior results.This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.This package was generated from typeshed commit `fbd7963fd62b206478f4916efc77734d25923b19` and was testedwith mypy 1.5.1, pyright 1.1.326, andpytype 2023.8.31.</longdescription>
