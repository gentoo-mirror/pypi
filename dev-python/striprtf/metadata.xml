	<longdescription># striprtf![Build status](https://github.com/joshy/striprtf/workflows/striprtf%20build/badge.svg)## PurposeThis is a simple library to convert rtf files to python strings. A lot ofmedical documents are written in rtf format which is not ideal for parsingand further processing. This library converts it to plain old text.## How to use```pythonfrom striprtf.striprtf import rtf_to_textrtf = &quot;some rtf encoded string&quot;text = rtf_to_text(rtf)print(text)```If you want to use a different encoding than `cp1252` you can pass it via the parameter `encoding`. This is only taken into account if no explicit codepage has been set. ```pythonfrom striprtf.striprtf import rtf_to_textrtf = &quot;some rtf encoded string in latin1&quot;text = rtf_to_text(rtf, encoding=&quot;latin-1&quot;)print(text)```Sometimes UnicodeDecodingErrors can happen because of various reasons.In this case you can try to relax the encoding process like this:```pythonfrom striprtf.striprtf import rtf_to_textrtf = &quot;some rtf encoded string&quot;text = rtf_to_text(rtf, errors=&quot;ignore&quot;)print(text)```## How to use onlineIf you don't want to install, there is also an online version available at https://striprtf.dev which can be used for free. ## History[Pyth](https://github.com/brendonh/pyth) was not working for the rtf files Ihad. The next best thing was this gist:https://gist.github.com/gilsondev/7c1d2d753ddb522e7bc22511cfb08676~~Very few additions where made, e.g. better formatting of tables. ~~In the meantime some encodings bugs have been fixed. :-)## Pushing to PyPi * pip install twineRun commands```python setup.py sdist bdist_wheeltwine upload -r testpypi dist/*twine upload -r pypi dist/*```</longdescription>
