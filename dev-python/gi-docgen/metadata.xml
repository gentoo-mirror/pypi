	<longdescription>GI-DocGen: Documentation tool for GObject-based libraries-------------------------------------------------------------------------------GI-DocGen is a document generator for GObject-based libraries. GObject isthe base type system of the GNOME project. GI-Docgen reuses theintrospection data generated by GObject-based libraries to generate the APIreference of these libraries, as well as other ancillary documentation.## Installation### Running GI-DocGen uninstalledYou can run GI-DocGen from its repository, by calling:```./gi-docgen.py```GI-DocGen will automatically detect this case.### Installing GI-DocGen via pipTo install GI-DocGen, you will need to have the following pieces of softwareavailable on your computer: - Python 3.6, or later - pipRun the following command:```pip3 install --user gi-docgen```After running the command above, make sure to have the `~/.local/bin`directory listed in your `$PATH` environment variable.To update GI-DocGen, run the following command:```pip3 install --user --upgrade gi-docgen```## UsageFirst, read [the GI-DocGen tutorial](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/gi-docgen/tutorial.html).The documentation for GI-DocGen is [available online](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/gi-docgen/).The `examples` directory in the repository contains simple project files forvarious GNOME libraries.## DisclaimerGI-DocGen is **not** a general purpose documentation tool for C libraries.While GI-DocGen can be used to generate API references for most GObject/Clibraries that expose introspection data, its main goal is to generate thereference for GTK and its immediate dependencies. Any and all attempts atmaking this tool more generic, or to cover more use cases, will be weightedheavily against its primary goal.GI-DocGen is still in development. The recommended use of GI-DocGen is toadd it as a sub-project to your [Meson build system](https://mesonbuild.com),and vendor it when releasing dist archives.You should **not** depend on a system-wide installation until GI-DocGen isdeclared stable.If you need a general purpose documentation tool, I strongly recommend: - [HotDoc](https://hotdoc.github.io/) - [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) - [GTK-Doc](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk-doc/)## Copyright and Licensing termsCopyright 2021  GNOME FoundationGI-DocGen is released under the terms of the Apache License, version 2.0, orunder the terms of the GNU General Public License, either version 3.0 or,at your option, any later version.</longdescription>
