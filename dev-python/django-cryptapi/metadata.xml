It's meant to create the callback URL        order_id=user_order.id,        coin='btc',        value=user_order.value    )        payment_request = invoice.request()        if payment_request is not None:        # Show the payment address to the user        ...    else:        # Handle request error, check RequestLogs on Admin```#### Where:``request`` is Django's view HttpRequest object  ``order_id`` is just your order id  ``coin`` is the ticker of the coin you wish to use, any of our supported coins (https://cryptapi.io/cryptocurrencies/). You need to have a ``Provider`` set up for that coin.  ``value`` is an integer of the value of your order, either in satoshi, litoshi, wei, piconero or IOTA&amp;nbsp;### Getting notified when the user pays```pythonfrom django.dispatch import receiverfrom cryptapi.signals import payment_complete@receiver(payment_complete)def payment_received(order_id, payment, value):    # Implement your logic to mark the order as paid and release the goods to the user    ...```Where:  ``order_id`` is the id of the order that you provided earlier, used to fetch your order  ``payment`` is an ``cryptapi.models.Payment`` object with the payment details, such as TXID, number of confirmations, etc.  ``value`` is the value the user paid, either in satoshi, litoshi, wei or IOTA#### Important:&gt;&gt;Don't forget to import your signals file. &gt;&gt;On your App's `apps.py` file:&gt;&gt;```python&gt;class MyAppConfig(AppConfig):&gt;    name = 'MyApp'&gt;    &gt;    def ready(self):&gt;        super(MyAppConfig, self).ready()&gt;&gt;        # noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences&gt;        import MyApp.signals&gt;```&gt;[django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/signals/#django.dispatch.receiver)### Using our provided interfaceCreate a view in ``views.py`````pythondef payment(_r, request_id):    try:        req = Request.objects.get(id=request_id)        coin = req.provider.coin        qrcode = get_qrcode(coin, req.address_in)        fiat = get_conversion(coin, 'eur', req.value_requested)        print(fiat)        ctx = {            'req': req,            'qrcode': qrcode,            'fiat': fiat['value_coin']        }        return render(_r, 'payment.html', context=ctx)    except Request.DoesNotExist:        pass    return redirect('store:request')```In your template HTML```djangotemplate{% extends 'base.html' %}{% load cryptapi_helper %}{% block content %}    {% generate_payment_template %}{% endblock %}```&amp;nbsp;### HelpersThis library has a couple of helpers to help you get started. They are present in the file ``utils.py``.``cryptapi.valid_providers()`` is a method that returns a list of tuples of the active providers that you can just feed into the choices of a ``form.ChoiceField````cryptapi.get_order_invoices(order_id)`` returns a list of ``cryptapi.models.Request`` objects of your order (you can have multiple objects for the same order if the user mistakenly initiated the payment with another coin or if he mistakenly didn't send the full payment)``cryptapi.callback_url(_r, params)`` build your callback URL to provide to ``get_request``. Should be used inside a view since ``_r = request``&amp;nbsp;### CryptAPI HelperThis is the helper responsible for the connections ot the API itself. All these functions are in the ``cryptapi.py`` file. ``get_info(coin)`` returns the information of all cryptocurrencies or just if ``coin=''`` or a specific cryptocurrency if ``coin='ltc'`` for example. [docs](https://docs.cryptapi.io/#operation/info)``get_supported_coins()`` returns all the support cryptocurrencies. You can consult them in this [list](https://cryptapi.io/fees/). ``get_logs(coin, callback_url)`` returns all the callback logs related to a request. ``callback_url`` should be the callback provided to our API. [docs](https://docs.cryptapi.io/#operation/logs)``get_qrcode(coin, address, value, size)`` returns a PNG of a QR Code with the address for payment. [docs](https://docs.cryptapi.io/tag/Bitcoin#operation/btcqrcode)``get_conversion(origin, to, value)`` returns the converted value in the parameter ``value_coin`` to the currency you wish, FIAT or Cryptocurrency.``get_estimate(coin)`` returns the estimation of the blockchain fees for the cryptocurrency specified in the parameter ``coin``. E.g: ``get_estimate('trc20_usdt')`` [docs](https://docs.cryptapi.io/#operation/estimate)``get_address(coin, address_out, callback_url, pending, api_key)`` requests a payment address to CryptAPI. If you don't wish to use [BlockBee](https://dash.blockbee.io/), you can leave ``api_key`` empty. [docs](https://docs.cryptapi.io/#operation/create)&amp;nbsp;### How to use the QR code (with address, coin and value)To generate a QR Code you must use ``get_qrcode`` in your view and feed the parameters to your template. To generate a QR Code image you must place content of the API response after ``data:image/png;base64,{{qr_code}}`` so the browser generates the QR Code.```djangotemplate&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,{{ qrcode.qr_code }}&quot; alt=&quot;Payment QR Code&quot;/&gt;```You can also make the QR Code clickable.```djangotemplate&lt;a href='{{ qrcode.payment_uri }}'&gt;    &lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,{{ qrcode.qr_code }}&quot; alt=&quot;Payment QR Code&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;```You can also add a value to the QR Code setting the ``value`` parameter to the value of your order (e.g ``0.2 LTC``). This may not function correctly in some wallets. **Use at your own risk.**## What is the Store application?We made the ``store`` application to provide you with code examples on how to implement our service. It also has the code for our suggested UI (both CSS and HTML).## HelpNeed help?
