	<longdescription>========================================= reno: A New Way to Manage Release Notes=========================================Reno is a release notes manager designed with high throughput in mind,supporting fast distributed development teams without introducingadditional development processes.  Our goal is to encourage detailedand accurate release notes for every release.Reno uses git to store its data, along side the code beingdescribed. This means release notes can be written when the codechanges are fresh, so no details are forgotten. It also means thatrelease notes can go through the same review process used for managingcode and other documentation changes.Reno stores each release note in a separate file to enable a largenumber of developers to work on multiple patches simultaneously, alltargeting the same branch, without worrying about mergeconflicts. This cuts down on the need to rebase or otherwise manuallyresolve conflicts, and keeps a development team moving quickly.Reno also supports multiple branches, allowing release notes to beback-ported from master to maintenance branches together with thecode for bug fixes.Reno organizes notes into logical groups based on whether theydescribe new features, bug fixes, known issues, or other topics ofinterest to the user. Contributors categorize individual notes as theyare added, and reno combines them before publishing.Notes can be styled using reStructuredText directives, and reno'sSphinx integration makes it easy to incorporate release notes intoautomated documentation builds.Notes are automatically associated with the release version based onthe git tags applied to the repository, so it is not necessary totrack changes manually using a bug tracker or other tool, or to worrythat an important change will be missed when the release notes arewritten by hand all at one time, just before a release.Modifications to notes are incorporated when the notes are shown intheir original location in the history. This feature makes it possibleto correct typos or otherwise fix a published release note after arelease is made, but have the new note content associated with theoriginal version number. Notes also can be deleted, eliminating themfrom future documentation builds.Project Meta-data=================.. .. image:: https://governance.openstack.org/tc/badges/reno.svg    :target: https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/tags/index.html* Free software: Apache license* Documentation: https://docs.openstack.org/reno/latest/* Source: https://opendev.org/openstack/reno/* Bugs: https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/933* IRC: #openstack-release on OFTC</longdescription>
