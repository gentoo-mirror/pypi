	<longdescription>[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/aiidalab-widgets-base/badge/?version=latest)](https://aiidalab-widgets-base.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)# AiiDAlab Widgets[AiiDAlab](https://materialscloud.org/aiidalab) applications typically involve some of following steps: * Prepare the input for a calculation (e.g. an atomic structure). * Select computational resources and submit a calculation to AiiDA. * Monitor a running calculation. * Find and analyze the results of a calculation.The AiiDAlab widgets help with these common tasks.## DocumentationHosted on [aiidalab-widgets-base.readthedocs.io](https://aiidalab-widgets-base.readthedocs.io).## For maintainersTo create a new release, clone the repository, install development dependencies with `pip install -e '.[dev]'`, and then execute `bumpver update [--major|--minor|--patch] [--tag [alpha|beta|rc]]`.This will:  1. Create a tagged release with bumped version and push it to the repository.  2. Trigger a GitHub actions workflow that creates a GitHub release and publishes it on PyPI.Additional notes:  - Use the `--dry` option to preview the release change.  - The release tag (e.g. a/b/rc) is determined from the last release.    Use the `--tag` option to switch the release tag.  - This packages follows semantic versioning.## LicenseMIT## CitationUsers of AiiDAlab are kindly asked to cite the following publication in their own work:A.
