	<longdescription>PyGeode is a software library intended to simplify the management, analysis,and visualization of gridded geophysical datasets such as those generated byclimate models. The library provides three main advantages. Firstly, it candefine a geophysical coordinate system for any given dataset, and allowsoperations to be carried conceptually in this physical coordinate system, ina way that is independent of the native coordinate system of a particulardataset. This greatly simplifies working with datasets from differentsources. Secondly, the library allows mathematical operations to be performedon datasets which fit on disk but not in memory; this is useful for dealingwith the extremely large datasets generated by climate models, and permitsoperations to be performed over networks. Finally, the library provides toolsfor visualizing these datasets in a scientifically useful way. The library iswritten in Python, and makes use of a number of existing packages to performthe underlying computations and to create plots.</longdescription>
