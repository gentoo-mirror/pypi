The reason for using itinstead of LACosmic is that it works very well for spectroscopic data and theresults are evidently superior. Some of the negative aspects of using thisexternal (meaning outside of Python domains) software were: The integration intothe pipeline's workflow and the use of an external `dcr.par` parameter file. Such parameters have to be changed by hand and can't be integrated into the pipeline's workflow itself. In particular for binning 2x2 and custom ROI those parameters contained in _dcr.par_ has to be specifically tuned.## DocumentationYou will find a user manual on [goodman.readthedocs.org](http://goodman.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)If you wish to know more about the instrument please check the [SOAR website](http://www.ctio.noao.edu/soar/content/goodman-high-throughput-spectrograph)## Having trouble?If you are having trouble operating the Goodman Pipeline we suggest the followingprocedure.* Check [existing issues](https://github.com/soar-telescope/goodman_pipeline/issues) or open a [new Issue](https://github.com/soar-telescope/goodman_pipeline/issues/new) on GitHub.## Development Team- [Simón Torres](https://github.com/simontorres) (NOIRLab Software Engineer - main code developer)- [César Briceño](https://github.com/cbaorion) (SOAR Telescope Scientist - team lead)- [Bruno Quint](https://github.com/b1quint) (Brazil Support Astronomer - code development adviser)## AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge the important contribution of  [David Sanmartim](https://github.com/dsanmartim), who developedthe initial incarnation of the redccd module. We thank [Tina Armond](https://github.com/tarmond) for herinvaluable help in adding calibrated comparison lamps to the [library](https://goodman.readthedocs.io/projects/lamps/en/latest/) ofreference comparison lamps for wavelength solution.Our work would not be possible without the friendly work atmosphere at CTIOheadquarters in La Serena, were we can interact with our SOAR and CTIOcolleagues in lively and useful discussions that have been important in makingthe Goodman pipeline possible.  We also acknowledge fruitful discussions andsuggestions from our colleagues Bart Dunlop, Chris Clemens, and Erik Dennihy,at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  ## Citations:  This pipeline makes extensive use of Astropy therefore you should cite as suggested  on [Astropy Citation Page](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/master/CITATION) as follows:      This research made use of Astropy, a community-developed core Python package    for Astronomy (Astropy Collaboration, 2013, 2018).      It also uses [DCR](http://users.camk.edu.pl/pych/DCR/) for cosmic rays identification  and removal.
