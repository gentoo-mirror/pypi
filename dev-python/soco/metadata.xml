	<longdescription>SoCo====SoCo (Sonos Controller) is a Python library that allows you tocontrol `Sonos speakers`_ programmatically. It was originally created at `MusicHack Day Sydney`_ by `Rahim Sonawalla`_ and is now developed by a `team ofpeople`_ at its `GitHub repository`_For more background on the project, please see Rahim's `blog post&lt;http://www.hirahim.com/blog/2012/04/29/dissecting-the-sonos-controller/&gt;`_.Visit the `SoCo documentation`_ for a more detailed overview of the functionailty... image:: https://badges.gitter.im/SoCo/SoCo.svg   :alt: Join the chat at https://gitter.im/SoCo/SoCo   :target: https://gitter.im/SoCo/SoCo?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge&amp;utm_content=badge.. image:: https://travis-ci.com/SoCo/SoCo.svg?branch=master   :target: https://travis-ci.com/SoCo/SoCo   :alt: Build Status.. image:: https://img.shields.io/requires/github/SoCo/SoCo/master.svg?style=flat   :target: https://requires.io/github/SoCo/SoCo/requirements/?branch=master   :alt: Requirements Status.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/soco.svg?style=flat    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/soco/    :alt: Latest PyPI versionWARNING-------Sonos has changed the way music service account information is available. This means that **currently a group of music service will give authentication issues and cannot be used at all**. Known members of this group are: Google Play Music, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Spotify and Napster.Issue #557 is a meta issue for this problem and you can use that to track progress on solving the issues, but*please refrain from posting &quot;me too&quot; comments* in there. Also, there is no need to open any more separate issue about this.If you have another music service that should be on the list, comment in #557**As of v0.26.0, nascent music service support has been reinstated, with some known issues. Testing and issue reportingwould be appreciated.**Installation------------SoCo requires Python 3.6 or newer.Use pip:``pip install soco``SoCo depends on a number of Python packages. If you use pip to install Soco,the dependencies will be installed automatically for you. If not, you can inspectthe requirements in the `requirements.txt &lt;https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo/blob/master/requirements.txt&gt;`_file.Basic Usage-----------You can interact with a Sonos Zone Player through a SoCo object. If you knowthe IP address of a Zone Player, you can create a SoCo object directly:.. code:: python    &gt;&gt;&gt; from soco import SoCo    &gt;&gt;&gt; my_zone = SoCo('192.168.1.101')    &gt;&gt;&gt; my_zone.player_name    Kitchen    &gt;&gt;&gt; my_zone.status_light = True    &gt;&gt;&gt; my_zone.volume = 6But perhaps the easiest way is to use the module-level `discover` function.This will find all the Zone Players on your network, and return a pythonset containing them:.. code:: python    &gt;&gt;&gt; from soco import discover    &gt;&gt;&gt; for zone in discover():    ...        print(zone.player_name)    Living Room    KitchenIf you prefer a list to a set:.. code:: python    &gt;&gt;&gt; zone_list = list(discover())    &gt;&gt;&gt; zone_list    [SoCo(&quot;192.168.1.101&quot;), SoCo(&quot;192.168.1.102&quot;)]    &gt;&gt;&gt; zone_list[0].mute = TrueOf course, you can also play music!.. code:: python    #!/usr/bin/env python    from soco import SoCo    if __name__ == '__main__':        sonos = SoCo('192.168.1.102') # Pass in the IP of your Sonos speaker        # You could use the discover function instead, if you don't know the IP        # Pass in a URI to a media file to have it streamed through the Sonos        # speaker        sonos.play_uri(            'http://ia801402.us.archive.org/20/items/TenD2005-07-16.flac16/TenD2005-07-16t10Wonderboy.mp3')        track = sonos.get_current_track_info()        print(track['title'])        sonos.pause()        # Play a stopped or paused track        sonos.play()Support-------If you need support for SoCo, feel free to post your question in the `SoCo Gitter Room &lt;https://gitter.im/SoCo/SoCo&gt;`_.Example Applications--------------------To show off what can be made with SoCo, a simple web application is included inthe ``examples`` folder... figure:: https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo/raw/master/examples/webapp/screenshot.png   :alt: Screenshot of web app   Screenshot of web appFeatures--------SoCo supports the following controls amongst others:-  Play, Pause, Stop-  Next track, Previous track-  Volume get and set-  Mute (or unmute)-  Get current transport information (if speaker is   playing, paused or stopped)-  Get information about the currently playing track   -  Track title   -  Artist   -  Album   -  Album Art (if available)   -  Track length   -  Duration played (for example, 30 seconds into a 3 minute song)   -  Playlist position (for example, item 5 in the playlist)   -  Track URI-  Receive events when the player state changes-  Search for and play music items:   -  Local music library   -  Webradio via TuneIn and music services (still unstable)   -  Saved Sonos favorites, favorite radio stations and shows-  Switch the speaker’s source to line-in or TV input (if the Zone Player   supports it)-  Manage the Sonos queue:   -  Get the items in the queue   -  Add items to the queue   -  Clear the queue   -  Play a specific song from the queue-  Join or unjoin speakers from a group-  Put all Sonos speakers in a network into “party mode”.-  Get or set alarms-  Get or set sleep timers-  Enable or disable surround speakers or subwoofer-  Get information regarding a home theater setup:   - If surround speakers or a subwoofer are paired   - Which audio channel a given speaker handles-  Get or set the speaker’s bass and treble EQ-  Toggle the speaker’s loudness compensation, night mode and dialog mode-  Toggle the white status light on the unit-  Get the speaker’s information   -  Zone Name   -  Zone Icon   -  UID (usually something like RINCON\_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX)   -  Serial Number   -  Software version   -  Hardware version   -  MAC Address-  Set the speaker’s Zone Name-  Start a music library update and determine if one is in progressSoCo also supports lower level access from Python to all Sonos services(e.g. ContentDirectory or RenderingControl).Related Projects----------------**Socos** is a command line tool for controlling Sonos devices. It is developedin conjunction with Soco, but in a `separate repository &lt;https://github.com/SoCo/socos&gt;`_.**SoCo-CLI** (`soco-cli &lt;https://github.com/avantrec/soco-cli&gt;`_) is a powerful andfully-featured command line tool suitable for use in scripts, scheduled tasks, etc. Itsupports time-based and state-based actions, and repeated commands using loops. Audiofiles on the local filesystem can be played back directly on Sonos from the command line.Multi-household Sonos systems are supported.Older Projects^^^^^^^^^^^^^^More of a Ruby fan? Not a problem, `Sam Soffes`_ is building out anawesome `Ruby gem`_.Looking for a GUI that’s more than just a sample project? `JoelBjörkman`_ is building a Sonos Controller GUI–great for folks on Linuxwhere there isn’t an official Sonos Controller application! Find, fork,and contribute to it here: https://github.com/labero/SoCo-Tk.SoCo Gitter Room----------------There is a `SoCo Gitter discussion room &lt;https://gitter.im/SoCo/SoCo&gt;`_.
