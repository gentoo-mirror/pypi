	<longdescription># Django Schema GraphDjango-schema-graph makes a colourful diagram out of your Django models. Thediagram is interactive, and makes it easy to toggle models and apps on/off atwill.It looks like this:| Feature       | Screenshot || ---           | --- || Models        | ![models screenshot](docs-images/models.png) || Apps          | ![apps screenshot](docs-images/apps.png) || Both together | ![models and apps screenshot](docs-images/combination.png) || Graph editor  | ![menu screenshot](docs-images/menu.png) |(Apologies that the images above don't work on PyPI. [Check it out onGitHub](https://github.com/meshy/django-schema-graph/blob/master/README.md).)## InstallationInstall from PyPI:```bashpip install django-schema-graph```Add to `INSTALLED_APPS`:```pythonINSTALLED_APPS = [    ...    'schema_graph',    ...]```Add to your URLs.```pythonfrom schema_graph.views import Schemaurlpatterns += [    # On Django 2+:    path(&quot;schema/&quot;, Schema.as_view()),    # Or, on Django &lt; 2:    url(r&quot;^schema/$&quot;, Schema.as_view()),]```## UseBrowse to `/schema/` (assuming that's where you put it in your URLs).You can control access to this page using the `SCHEMA_GRAPH_VISIBLE` setting,or by subclassing `schema_graph.views.Schema` and overriding `access_permitted`.By default the page is only visible when `DEBUG` is `True`,because we assume that you don't want to leak sensitive information about yourwebsite outside of local development.## SupportTests run on sensible combinations of:- Python (3.6-3.11)- Django (1.11-4.1)If you're stuck on old version of Python or Django, you may consider installingold versions.They will probably have fewer features, and there will be no support for them.The last version to support Python 2.7 and 3.5 was 1.2.0The last version to support Django 1.8 was 1.2.0## Alternatives- [`django-spaghetti-and-meatballs`](https://github.com/LegoStormtroopr/django-spaghetti-and-meatballs)  is great. At the time of writing, it offers a lot more detailed information  on the models in the diagram, but doesn't allow them to be turned on/off in  the page.</longdescription>
