Amazon's `Trusted Advisor &lt;https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/&gt;`_can help this, but even the version that comes with Business and Enterprise support only monitors a small subset of AWS limitsand only alerts *weekly*. The new Service Quotas service can also help with this, but relies on CloudWatch alarms per-limit to notifyyou when you approach your limits; this cannot easily scale to the hundreds of current service limits. awslimitchecker provides a command linescript and reusable Python package that queries your current usage of AWS resources and compares it to limits (hard-coded AWS defaults that youcan override, API-based limits where available, Service Quotas data where available, or data from Trusted Advisor where available), notifyingyou when you are approaching or at your limits.Full project documentation for the latest release is available at `http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ &lt;http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_.Status------awslimitchecker is mature software, with approximately 13,000 downloads per month and in daily use at numerous organizations.Development status is being tracked on a board at waffle.io: https://waffle.io/jantman/awslimitcheckerWhat It Does------------- Check current AWS resource usage against AWS Service Limits- Show and inspect current usage- Override default Service Limits (for accounts with increased limits)- Compare current usage to limits; return information about limits that  exceed thresholds, and (CLI wrapper) exit non-0 if thresholds are exceeded- Define custom thresholds per-limit- where possible, pull current limits from Trusted Advisor API- where possible, pull current limits from each service's API (for services that provide this information)- where possible, pull current limits from the Service Quotas service- Supports explicitly setting the AWS region- Supports using `STS &lt;http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html&gt;`_ to assume roles in other accounts, including using ``external_id``.- Optionally refresh Trusted Advisor &quot;Service Limits&quot; check before polling  Trusted Advisor data, and optionally wait for the refresh to complete (up to  an optional maximum time limit). See  `Getting Started - Trusted Advisor &lt;http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#trusted-advisor&gt;`_  for more information.- Optionally send current usage and limit metrics to a metrics store, such as Datadog.- Optionally send warning/critical alerts to notification providers, such as PagerDuty.Requirements------------**Either Docker in order to run via the** `docker image &lt;http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docker.html&gt;`__, **or:*** Python 3.5 or newer.* Python `VirtualEnv &lt;http://www.virtualenv.org/&gt;`_ and ``pip`` (recommended installation method; your OS/distribution should have packages for these)* `boto3 &lt;http://boto3.readthedocs.org/&gt;`_ &gt;= 1.4.6 and its dependency `botocore &lt;https://botocore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_ &gt;= 1.6.0.Alternatively, awslimitchecker may be installed through `conda &lt;https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/&gt;`_ with ``conda install -c conda-forge awslimitchecker``. This will automatically install the required dependencies as well.Installation and Usage-----------------------See `Getting Started &lt;http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html&gt;`_.Credentials-----------See `Credentials &lt;http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#credentials&gt;`_.Getting Help and Asking Questions----------------------------------See `Getting Help &lt;http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_help.html&gt;`_.For paid support and development options, please see the`Enterprise Support Agreements and Contract Development &lt;http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_help.html#enterprise-support-agreements-and-contract-development&gt;`_section of the documentation.There is also a `gitter.im chat channel &lt;https://gitter.im/awslimitchecker/Lobby&gt;`_ for support and discussion.Changelog---------See `Changelog &lt;http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html&gt;`_.Contributions-------------Pull requests are most definitely welcome. Please cut them against the **develop** branch. For more information, seethe `development documentation &lt;http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#pull-requests&gt;`_.
