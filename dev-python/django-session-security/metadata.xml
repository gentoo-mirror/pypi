Aninactive browser should be logged out automatically if the user left hisworkstation, to protect sensitive data that may be displayed in the browser. Itmay be useful for CRMs, intranets, and such projects.For example, if the user leaves for a coffee break, this app can force logoutafter say 5 minutes of inactivity.Why not just set the session to expire after X minutes ?--------------------------------------------------------Or &quot;Why does this app even exist&quot; ? Here are the reasons:- if the user session expires before the user is done reading a page: he will  have to login again.- if the user session expires before the user is done filling a form: his work  will be lost, and he will have to login again, and probably yell at you, dear  django dev ... at least I know I would !This app allows to short circuit those limitations in session expiry.How does it work ?------------------When the user loads a page, SessionSecurity middleware will set the lastactivity to now. The last activity is stored as datetimein ``request.session['_session_security']``. To avoid having the middlewareupdate that last activity datetime for a URL, add the url to``settings.SESSION_SECURITY_PASSIVE_URLS``.When the user moves mouse, click, scroll or press a key, SessionSecurity willsave the DateTime as a JavaScript attribute. It will send the number of secondssince when the last user activity was recorded to PingView, next time it shouldping.First, a warning should be shown after ``settings.SESSION_SECURITY_WARN_AFTER``seconds. The warning displays a text like &quot;Your session is about to expire,move the mouse to extend it&quot;.Before displaying this warning, SessionSecurity will upload the time since thelast client-side activity was recorded. The middleware will take it if it isshorter than what it already has - ie. another more recent activity wasdetected in another browser tab. The PingView will respond with the number ofseconds since the last activity - all browser tab included.If there was no other, more recent, activity recorded by the server: it willshow the warning. Otherwise it will update the last activity in javascript fromthe PingView response.Same goes to expire after ``settings.SESSION_SECURITY_EXPIRE_AFTER`` seconds.Javascript will first make an ajax request to PingView to ensure that anothermore recent activity was not detected anywhere else - in any other browser tab.Requirements------------- Python 2.7 or 3.5+- jQuery 1.7+- Django 1.8 to 2.0- django.contrib.staticfiles or #YoYoResources---------You could subscribe to the mailing list ask questions or just be informed ofpackage updates.- `Git graciously hosted  &lt;https://github.com/yourlabs/django-session-security/&gt;`_ by `GitHub  &lt;http://github.com&gt;`_,- `Documentation graciously hosted  &lt;http://django-session-security.rtfd.org&gt;`_ by `RTFD  &lt;http://rtfd.org&gt;`_,- `Package graciously hosted  &lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-session-security/&gt;`_ by `PyPi  &lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi&gt;`_,- `Mailing list graciously hosted  &lt;http://groups.google.com/group/yourlabs&gt;`_ by `Google  &lt;http://groups.google.com&gt;`_- For **Security** issues, please contact yourlabs-security@googlegroups.com- `Continuous integration graciously hosted  &lt;http://travis-ci.org/yourlabs/django-session-security&gt;`_ by `Travis-ci  &lt;http://travis-ci.org&gt;`_</longdescription>
