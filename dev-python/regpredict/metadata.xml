	<longdescription># Evx regpredict mlbotThis is a simplified version of [evxpredictor](https://pypi.org/project/evxpredictor/) package used to generate buy and sell signals for crypto and conventional stock markets based on the excess volume indicator(EVX). EVX is a concept where the bid-ask spread is estimated inherently from current market prices. You can read more about Evx in the whitepaper [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345313655_DeFiPaper)  # InstallationInstall regpredict with `python3 -m pip install regpredict`  # UsageIn your python script simply import the module and use as follows:```  from regpredict.regbot import signalprint(signal(20,65,85,25,68,23,0.25))```The above methods take an assets volume, rsi5,rsi15,sma5,sma7,sma25,and the two-period gradient to sma25 of the asset based on the time interval you have chosen. A zero classification output would instruct the user to sell, while one output means don't sell or buy if the asset is not already present in the orders.  # Testing an entire dataframeTesting of a dataframe for correct buy, sell signals is as simple as applying the function as follows:  ```import pandas as pdfrom regbot import signal#from regpredict.regbot import signaldf = pd.read_csv('../path/to/your_validation.csv')y_pred = []def getSignal(vol,rsi_5,rsi_15,sma_5,sma_7,sma_25,grad_sma25):    return signal(vol,rsi_5,rsi_15,sma_5,sma_7,sma_25,grad_sma25)df = df[df['enter_long'] == 1]print(df.head())df['result'] = df.apply(lambda row: getSignal(row['volume'],row['rsi-05'],row['rsi-15'],row['sma-05'],row['sma-07'],row['sma-25'],row['grad_sma25'] ), axis=1)print(df.head())print(len(df[df['result'] == df['enter_long']]), len(df))```Your original data must already have some presumed 'buy' signal.# WarningThis is not financial advise. Regpredict is entirely on its preliminary stages. Use it at your own risk.</longdescription>
