	<longdescription># 3131 is a simple tool you can use to run code in the background on a server.For example```31 c 'sleep 100; echo 2'```runs the command `sleep 100; echo 2` in a screen session then sends you an email with the output of the command once it is complete.## SetupInstall 31 by running```pip install 31```Then set up your email address by running```31 config email youremail@example.com```### Quick dependency setupOn ubuntu you can run```sudo apt install screen mailutils```to quickly set up the dependencies needed.### Detailed dependency setup#### Mail programBy default, `31` searches for a mail program to use from the following list. Youcan also force it to use one of the programs by using the command```31 config mail_program &lt;mail program name&gt;```- `gnu_mail`. To install on ubuntu you can run```sudo apt install mailutils```- `mutt`. To install on ubuntu you can run```sudo apt install mutt```#### Screen ManagerCurrently 31 only supports `screen`. To install screen on ubuntu run```sudo apt install screen```## OptionsSee `31 -h` for a full list of options. This section covers only some of the more complicated ones### ForeachThis option allows you to run multiple commands with text substitution. As a basic usage example, the code```sh31 c -f %x 1,2,3 'touch %x.txt'```Creates each of the files `1.txt`, `2.txt`, and `3.txt`. The variable substitution is managed via direct text-substitution,and thus your variables do not need to begin with %, this works equally well (though is far less readable)```sh31 c -f 2 1,2,3 'touch 2.txt'```You can also modify two variables in tandem like this:```sh31 c -f2 %x %ext 1,2,3 txt,png,py 'touch %x.%ext'```This creates the files `1.txt`, `2.png`, `3.py`. If you instead want to create all combinations, you can run:```sh31 c -f %x 1,2,3 -f %ext txt,png,py 'touch %x.%ext'```This creates the files `1.txt`, `1.png`, `1.py`, `2.txt`, `2.png`, `2.py`, `3.txt`, `3.png`, `3.py`.The values field is in comma-separated-value form, which means you can use `&quot;` as a CSV escape, as such:```sh31 -c -f %x '&quot;,&quot;,2' `touch %x.txt````which creates the files `,.txt` and `2.txt`.</longdescription>
