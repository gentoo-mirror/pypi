Install via `pip`2.  Initialize a project from a template3.  Use the template```bash$: pip install 'angreal&gt;=2' #pip install angreal will also work$: angreal init https://github.com/angreal/python```---## What is it?Angreal is an attempt to solve two problems that I was running into inboth my personal and professional life as a data scientist and softwaredeveloper. I do things often enough that they needed automation, Idon\'t do things so often that I remember all of the steps/commands Imight need to get them done. Angreal solves this problem by allowing meto remember by forgetting : I only have to remember the command to dosomething not the actual steps to complete the task.### How does it solve these challenges ?Angreal provides a way to template the structure of projects and a wayof executing methods for interacting with that project in a consistentmanner. These methods (called tasks) travel with the project so whiletemplated initially, they\'re customizable to the project - allowing somelevel of flexibility in how a task functions between projects.### Why 2.0 ?The original angreal was built on top of a number of python modules thatwere under active development and used by a number of other projects.The nature of the application itself meant that core application founditself in dependency hell regularly - and became rather annoying to use.The 2.0.0 release is a complete rewrite that uses[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to provide a compiled binary with the goal that it willrequire no external python dependencies.</longdescription>
