	<longdescription># Introduction[Cairo](https://cairo-lang.org/) is a programming language for writing provable programs.# DocumentationThe Cairo documentation consists of two parts: &quot;Hello Cairo&quot; and &quot;How Cairo Works?&quot;.Both parts can be found in https://cairo-lang.org/docs/.We recommend starting from [Setting up the environment](https://cairo-lang.org/docs/quickstart.html).# Installation instructionsYou should be able to download the python package zip file directly from[github](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/releases/tag/v0.11.0.2)and install it using ``pip``.See [Setting up the environment](https://cairo-lang.org/docs/quickstart.html).However, if you want to build it yourself, you can build it from the git repository.It is recommended to run the build inside a docker (as explained below),since it guarantees that all the dependenciesare installed. Alternatively, you can try following the commands in the[docker file](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/Dockerfile).## Building using the dockerfile*Note*: This section is relevant only if you wish to build the Cairo python-package yourself,rather than downloading it.The root directory holds a dedicated Dockerfile, which automatically builds the package and runsthe unit tests on a simulated Ubuntu 18.04 environment.You should have docker installed (see https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).Clone the repository and initialize the git submodules using:```bash&gt; git clone git@github.com:starkware-libs/cairo-lang.git&gt; cd cairo-lang```Build the docker image:```bash&gt; docker build --tag cairo .```If everything works, you should see```bashSuccessfully tagged cairo:latest```Once the docker image is built, you can fetch the python package zip file using:```bash&gt; container_id=$(docker create cairo)&gt; docker cp ${container_id}:/app/cairo-lang-0.11.0.2.zip .&gt; docker rm -v ${container_id}```</longdescription>
