	<longdescription>FOOOF: Fitting Oscillations &amp; One-Over FFOOOF is a fast, efficient, physiologically-informed model to parameterize neuralpower spectra, characterizing both the aperiodic &amp; periodic components.The model conceives of the neural power spectrum as consisting of two distinct components:1) an aperiodic component, reflecting 1/f like characteristics, modeled with an exponential fit, with2) band-limited peaks, reflecting putative oscillations, and modeled as GaussiansThe module includes:- Code for applying models to parameterize neural power spectra- Plotting functions for visualizing power spectra, model fits, and model parameters- Analysis functions for examining model components and parameters- Utilities for Input/Output management, data management and analysis reports- Simulation code for simulating power spectra for methods testingMore details are available on the documentation site.Documentation: https://fooof-tools.github.io/If you use this code in your project, please cite:Haller M, Donoghue T, Peterson E, Varma P, Sebastian P, Gao R, Noto T, Knight RT, Shestyuk A,Voytek B (2018) Parameterizing Neural Power Spectra. bioRxiv, 299859. doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/299859A full description of the method and approach is available in this paper.Direct Paper Link: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/299859v1</longdescription>
