Why not also build **how** you want?This is an implementation of smart contracts for Cardano which are written in a strict subset of valid Python.The general philosophy of this project is to write a compiler that ensure the following:If the program compiles then:1. it is a valid Python program2. the output running it with python is the same as running it on-chain.### Why opshin?- 100% valid Python. Leverage the existing tool stack for Python, syntax highlighting, linting, debugging, unit-testing, [property-based testing](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/), [verification](https://github.com/marcoeilers/nagini)- Intuitive. Just like Python.- Flexible. Imperative, functional, the way you want it.- Efficient &amp; Secure. Static type inference ensures strict typing and optimized code### Getting Started#### OpShin Pioneer ProgramCheck out the [opshin-pioneer-program](https://github.com/OpShin/opshin-pioneer-program) for a host of educational example contracts, test cases and off-chain code.#### Example repositoryCheck out the [opshin-starter-kit](https://github.com/OpShin/opshin-starter-kit) repository for a quick start in setting up a development environmentand compiling some sample contracts yourself.You can replace the contracts in your local copy of the repository with code from the`examples` section here to start exploring different contracts.#### Developer Community and QuestionsThis repository contains a discussions page.Feel free to open up a new discussion with questions regarding development using opshin and using certain features.Others may be able to help you and will also benefit from the previously shared questions.Check out the community [here](https://github.com/OpShin/opshin/discussions)You can also chat with other developers [in the welcoming discordcommunity](https://discord.gg/umR3A2g4uw) of OpShin#### InstallationInstall Python 3.8, 3.9 or 3.10. Then run```bashpython3 -m pip install opshin```#### Writing a Smart ContractA short non-complete introduction in starting to write smart contracts follows.1. Make sure you understand EUTxOs, Addresses, Validators etc on Cardano. [There is a wonderful crashcourse by @KtorZ](https://aiken-lang.org/fundamentals/eutxo). The contract will work on these concepts2. Make sure you understand python. opshin works like python and uses python. There are tons of tutorials for python, choose what suits you best.3. Make sure your contract is valid python and the types check out. Write simple contracts first and run them using `opshin eval` to get a feeling for how they work.4. Make sure your contract is valid opshin code. Run `opshin compile` and look at the compiler erros for guidance along what works and doesn't work and why.5. Dig into the [`examples`](https://github.com/OpShin/opshin/tree/main/examples) to understand common patterns. Check out the [`prelude`](https://opshin.opshin.dev/opshin/prelude.html) for understanding how the Script Context is structured and how complex datums are defined.6. Check out the [sample repository](https://github.com/OpShin/opshin-starter-kit) to find a sample setup for developing your own contract.In summary, a smart contract in opshin is defined by the function `validator` in your contract file.The function validates that a specific value can be spent, minted, burned, withdrawn etc, dependingon where it is invoked/used as a credential.If the function fails (i.e. raises an error of any kind such as a `KeyError` or `AssertionError`)the validation is denied, and the funds can not be spent, minted, burned etc.&gt; There is a subtle difference here in comparison to most other Smart Contract languages.&gt; In opshin a validator may return anything (in particular also `False`) - as long as it does not fail, the execution is considered valid.&gt; This is more similar to how contracts in Solidity always pass, unless they run out of gas or hit an error.&gt; So make sure to `assert` what you want to ensure to hold for validation!A simple contract called the &quot;Gift Contract&quot; verifies that only specific wallets can withdraw money.They are authenticated by a signature.If you don't understand what a pubkeyhash is and how this validates anything, check out [this gentle introduction into Cardanos EUTxO](https://aiken-lang.org/fundamentals/eutxo).Also see the [tutorial by `pycardano`](https://pycardano.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/plutus.html) for explanations on what each of the parameters to the validator meansand how to build transactions with the contract.```python3from opshin.prelude import *@dataclass()class WithdrawDatum(PlutusData):    pubkeyhash: bytesdef validator(datum: WithdrawDatum, redeemer: None, context: ScriptContext) -&gt; None:    sig_present = False    for s in context.tx_info.signatories:        if datum.pubkeyhash == s:            sig_present = True    assert sig_present, &quot;Required signature missing&quot;```All contracts written in opshin are 100% valid python.Minting policies expect only a redeemer and script context as argument.Check out the [Architecture guide](https://github.com/OpShin/opshin/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md#minting-policy---spending-validator-double-function)for details on how to write double functioning contracts.The [`examples`](https://github.com/OpShin/opshin/blob/main/examples) folder contains more examples.Also check out the [opshin-pioneer-program](https://github.com/OpShin/opshin-pioneer-program) and [opshin-starter-kit](https://github.com/OpShin/opshin-starter-kit) repo.### CompilingWrite your program in python. You may start with the content of `examples`.Arguments to scripts are passed in as Plutus Data objects in JSON notation.You can run any of the following commands```bash# Evaluate script in Python - this can be used to make sure there are no obvious errorsopshin eval examples/smart_contracts/assert_sum.py &quot;{\&quot;int\&quot;: 4}&quot; &quot;{\&quot;int\&quot;: 38}&quot; &quot;{\&quot;constructor\&quot;: 0, \&quot;fields\&quot;: []}&quot;# Compile script to 'uplc', the Cardano Smart Contract assemblyopshin compile examples/smart_contracts/assert_sum.py```### DeployingThe deploy process generates all artifacts required for usage with common libraries like [pycardano](https://github.com/Python-Cardano/pycardano), [lucid](https://github.com/spacebudz/lucid) and the [cardano-cli](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node).```bash# Automatically generate all artifacts needed for using this contractopshin build examples/smart_contracts/assert_sum.py```See the [tutorial by `pycardano`](https://pycardano.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/plutus.html) for explanations how to build transactions with `opshin` contracts.### The small print_Not every valid python program is a valid smart contract_.Not all language features of python will or can be supported.The reasons are mainly of practical nature (i.e. we can't infer types when functions like `eval` are allowed).Specifically, only a pure subset of python is allowed.Further, only immutable objects may be generated.For your program to be accepted, make sure to only make use of language constructs supported by the compiler.You will be notified of which constructs are not supported when trying to compile.### Name&gt; Eopsin (Korean: 업신; Hanja: 業神) is the goddess of the storage and wealth in Korean mythology and shamanism. &gt; [...] Eopsin was believed to be a pitch-black snake that had ears. [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eopsin)Since this project tries to merge Python (a large serpent) and Pluto/Plutus (Greek wealth gods), the name appears fitting.The name e_opsin is pronounced _op-shin_.e## Contributing### ArchitectureThis program consists of a few independent components:1. An aggressive static type inferencer2. Rewriting tools to simplify complex python expressions3. A compiler from a subset of python into UPLC### Debugging artefactsFor debugging purposes, you can also run```bash# Compile script to 'uplc', and evaluate the script in UPLC (for debugging purposes)opshin eval_uplc examples/smart_contracts/assert_sum.py &quot;{\&quot;int\&quot;: 4}&quot; &quot;{\&quot;int\&quot;: 38}&quot; &quot;{\&quot;constructor\&quot;: 0, \&quot;fields\&quot;: []}&quot;# Compile script to 'pluto', an intermediate language (for debugging purposes)opshin compile_pluto examples/smart_contracts/assert_sum.py```### SponsoringYou can sponsor the development of opshin through GitHub or [Teiki](https://alpha.teiki.network/projects/opshin) or just by sending ADA.
