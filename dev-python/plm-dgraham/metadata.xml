	<longdescription># Player Lineup Manager## HistorySome variant of *plm* has been used privately since 2014 to schedule tennis doubles matches for a group of around 30 tennis players. Play for this group occurs weekly on Tuesdays using as many courts as necessary and the schedules are made for three months (one quarter) at a time. More recently, smaller Monday and Friday groups have been added each using at most one court. The process involves these steps.- Obtain from each player a list of the dates that the player can play.- Randomly sort available players for each date into groups of two (singles) or four (doubles) taking account of previous pairings.- From each group, randomly select a 'captain' taking account of previous selections.- Produce a &quot;user friendly&quot; version of the schedule organized both by date and by player.- Send the completed schedule to each player.The current version of this program automates each of the steps in this process and allows some flexibility in scheduling dates, indicating a willingness to be a possible substitute, specifying the number of players per court (doubles or singles), and so forth. A further change is that all information relevant to a project is now stored in a single, project file in *yaml* format with players's responses listing the dates that the player *can* play rather than the dates the player *cannot* play. A final change is that *plm* is now publically available both from *PyPi*, [plm-dgraham](https://pypi.org/project/plm-dgraham/), and from *GitHub*, [dagraham/plm-dgraham](https://github.com/dagraham/plm-dgraham).## RequirementsThis program requires `python3`. To check for this requirement, open a terminal window and execute:        ~ % which python3If *python3* is installed the response should be something like        /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/bin/python3and, otherwise,        python3 not foundIf *python3* is not installed, follow the appropriate installation procedure for your platform.## Initial SetupIf *python3* is installed, the next step is to setup a *home directory* for *plm* to use when it starts. These are the options:- If the current working directory contains a file 'roster.yaml' and a directory 'projects', then it will be used as the *home directory*.- Otherwise if the environmental variable 'plmHOME' is set and points to a directory, then that directory will be used as the *home directory*.- Otherwise `~/plm` will be used as the *home directory* and, with your permission, created if it does not already exist.When *plm* is started for the first time, a sub-directory called `projects` and a file called `roster.yaml` will be created in the *home directory* if they do not already exist.## Installation### For personal useThe easiest way to install *plm* for personal use is to use *pip*. First update the python package manager, *pip*, using python3        ~ % python3 -m pip install -U pipand then install *plm* itself        ~ % python3 -m pip install -U plm-dgrahamThis will install *plm* and any needed supporting python modules. This same can also also be used to update *plm* when a new version becomes available.### For use in an isolated environment {#For-use-in-an-isolated-environment}Installing etm in an isolated or virtual environment (sandbox) is only slightly more complicated. Begin by using *pip* to install *pipx*:    $ python3 -m pip install -U pipxNow run:    $ pipx ensurepathto ensure that directories necessary for *pipx* operation are in your PATH environment variable and finally to install *etm* itself:    $ pipx install plm-dgrahamTo upgrade *etm* when a new version becomes available, simply replace &quot;install&quot; in this command with &quot;upgrade&quot;.## Starting *plm*Either way, you can then start *etm* with    $ plm &lt;path to home&gt;and you will see something like this        Player Lineup Manager (0.3.4)        home directory: ~/plm        project: The active project has not yet been chosen.        Use command 'c' to create one or 'p' to select one.        commands:            h:  show this help message            H:  show on-line documentation            e:  edit 'roster.yaml' using the default text editor            c:  create/update a project                           (1)            p:  select the active project from existing projects  (1)            a:  ask players for their &quot;can play&quot; dates            (2)            r:  record the &quot;can play&quot; responses                   (3)            n:  nag players to submit can play responses          (4)            s:  schedule play using the &quot;can play&quot; responses      (5)            d:  deliver the schedule to the players               (6)            v:  view the current settings of a project            u:  check for an update to a later plm version            q:  quit        command:This begins a loop in which *plm* waits for you to enter a command at the prompt, processes the command and, unless the command *q* (quit) is given, waits for your next command.Note: the commands *a*, *r*, *s*, *d* and *v* begin with a request that you select the *active project* if you have not already done so with either *c* or *p*. Tab completion is available and, once a selection is made, this project becomes the *active project* for any further use of the commands in this group while the command loop continues.### The Player Directory: roster.yamlThis file is the directory for the players in all of your projects. It should be populated with all the relevant players for a project before you create the project itself.You can open `roster.yaml` in your favorite editor or use command *e*:        command: eto have *plm* open the file for you. Each line in the roster file should have the format        lastname, firstname: [emailaddress,  tag1, tag2, ... ]For example:        Doaks, Steve: [stvdoaks321@gmail.com, mon, tue]        Smith, John: [jsmith123@gmail.com, tue, fri]        ...When creating a new project, you will be prompted for the tag of the players to be included so that, in the above example, the tag `mon` would include only Steve, but the tag `tue` would include both Steve and John.It is worth devoting some thought to the *tag* scheme you will use before you start adding players. My schedules involve groups that play on a particular week day so I tend to use tags for the week day that the group plays, e.g., `mon` for the group that plays on *Monday*. Note that tags are case sensitive so `mon`, `Mon` and `MON` are all different tags.### A New Project From Start to Finish#### 1. Create the project fileStart *plm*, if necessary, and use the *create project* command:        command: cThen follow the on-line prompts to enter the project information. This information will be stored in a new file in the projects directory, `&lt;project_name&gt;.yaml`, where `&lt;project_name&gt;` is the name you provide for the project. A short name that sorts well and is suggestive is recommended, e.g., `2022-4Q-TU`.#### 2. Request players' availability datesWith the project file created, the next step is to request the &quot;can play&quot; dates from the players. To do this start *plm*, if necessary, and use the *ask* command:        command: aYou will be advised to open your favorite email application and create a new, empty email. You will then be prompted to select the relevant project. Tab completion is available to choose the project you created in the previous step. When you have selected the project, you will then be advised that the relevant email addresses have been copied to the system clipboard. Paste these into the &quot;To&quot; section of your new email and then press *return* in *plm* to continue. You will next be advised that the relevant subject has been copied to the system clipboard. Paste this into the &quot;Subject&quot; section of your email and again press *return* in *plm* to continue. You will finally be advised that the body of the request email has been copied to the system clipboard for you to paste into your email. When you are satisfied with the result, you can send the completed email.#### 3. Enter player &quot;can play&quot; responsesAs you receive responses, you can start *plm*, if necessary, and use the *record* command:        command: rAgain you will be prompted to choose the relevant project with tab completion available. This begins a loop in which you can choose a player using tab completion and then enter the player's response to the &quot;can play&quot; dates query. The response for a player can be 'all', 'none', 'nr' (no response) or a comma separated list of dates using the month/day format. Asterisks can be appended to dates in which the player wants to be listed as a sub, e.g., '10/4, 10/18*, 10/25' for can play on 10/4 or 10/25 and might be able to subsitute on 10/18. This process continues until you enter a 'q' to end the loop and, if changes have been made, indicate whether or not you would like to save them. This entry process can be repeated as often as you like until you are satisfied that all responses have been correctly entered.Hint: you can have *plm* running in a terminal window near your email program with the `r` command activated so that when you get a reply from say, Joe Smith, you can just enter &quot;j&quot; at the prompt to choose &quot;Joe Smith&quot; using auto completion and then enter his reply. This is handy because the replies will, at best, arrive sporadically.#### 4. Process responses to create the scheduleStart *plm*, if necessary, and use the *schedule* command when you are satisfied that all player responses have been received and recorded.        command: sAgain, you will be prompted to choose the relevant project using tab completion. The schedule will be processed and added to the project file without further input.#### 5. Deliver the completed schedule to the playersThis step involves the *deliver* command.        command: dAs with the process for requesting &quot;can play&quot; dates, this prompts for the relevant project and then successively copies 1) the email addresses, 2) the subject and 3) the schedule itself to the system clipboard so that each can be pasted in turn into an email to be sent to the relevant players.### Modifying an existing projectYou might want to add a player to a project you've already created, update the email address of an existing player or make some other change to an existing project. To do this, first make any needed changes to `roster.yaml` using        command: eWhen adding new players or modifying the email addresses of existing players, the changes will be incorporated into an existing project in the next step. Also, any responses that have been recorded for existing players will be preserved in the next step. However, changing the *name* of an existing player will effectively *delete* the original player and then *add* the new player. Any &quot;can play&quot; response you might have recorded in the project under the original name of the player would be lost in the process.When you've finished updating `roster.yaml`, the next step is to use the  *project* command        command: pYou will again be prompted for the same information you entered when you first created the project, but this time your previous responses will be the defaults. With each prompt, you can simply press *enter* to accept your original entry or make any changes you like and then press *enter* to update the entry. When you have finished with each of the prompts, you will be asked for a final confirmation before modifying the original project file. As noted above, any &quot;can play&quot; responses that had previously been recorded in the project will be preserved for players whose names have not been changed.</longdescription>
