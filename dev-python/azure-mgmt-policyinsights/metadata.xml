	<longdescription># Microsoft Azure SDK for PythonThis is the Microsoft Azure Policy Insights Client Library.This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.For a more complete view of Azure libraries, see the [azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).# UsageTo learn how to use this package, see the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)For docs and references, see [Python SDK References](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/)Code samples for this package can be found at [Policy Insights Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&amp;term=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing&amp;terms=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing) on docs.microsoft.com.Additional code samples for different Azure services are available at [Samples Repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)# Provide FeedbackIf you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the[Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)section of the project.![Impressions](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2Fazure-mgmt-policyinsights%2FREADME.png)# Release History## 1.0.0 (2020-12-22)**Features**  - Model ExpressionEvaluationDetails has a new parameter expression_kind  - Added operation group PolicyRestrictionsOperations## 1.0.0b1 (2020-10-26)This is beta preview version.This version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).**General breaking changes**- Credential system has been completly revamped:  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user  - For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)**General new features**- Type annotations support using `typing`. SDKs are mypy ready.- This client has now stable and official support for async. Check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.- This client now support natively tracing library like OpenCensus or OpenTelemetry. See this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.## 0.5.0 (2020-03-20)**Features**  - Model PolicyState has a new parameter policy_set_definition_version  - Model PolicyState has a new parameter policy_definition_version  - Model PolicyState has a new parameter policy_assignment_version  - Added operation PolicyStatesOperations.trigger_subscription_evaluation  - Added operation PolicyStatesOperations.trigger_resource_group_evaluation## 0.4.0 (2019-12-31)**Features**  - Model PolicyDefinitionSummary has a new parameter    policy_definition_group_names  - Model Remediation has a new parameter resource_discovery_mode  - Model PolicyAssignmentSummary has a new parameter policy_groups  - Model PolicyState has a new parameter    policy_definition_group_names  - Model SummaryResults has a new parameter policy_group_details  - Model SummaryResults has a new parameter policy_details  - Model SummaryResults has a new parameter resource_details  - Added operation group PolicyMetadataOperations**Breaking changes**  - Removed operation PolicyStatesOperations.get_metadata**General Breaking Changes**This version uses a next-generation code generator that might introducebreaking changes if from some import. In summary, some modules wereincorrectly visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed severalissues caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used inthe first place. PolicyInsightsClient cannot be imported fromazure.mgmt.policyinsights.policy_insights_client anymore (import fromazure.mgmt.policyinsights works like before)PolicyInsightsClientConfiguration import has been moved fromazure.mgmt.policyinsights.policy_insights_client toazure.mgmt.policyinsights A model MyClass from a &quot;models&quot; sub-modulecannot be imported anymore usingazure.mgmt.policyinsights.models.my_class (import fromazure.mgmt.policyinsights.models works like before) An operation classMyClassOperations from an operations sub-module cannot be importedanymore using azure.mgmt.policyinsights.operations.my_class_operations(import from azure.mgmt.policyinsights.operations works like before)Last but not least, HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default.You should always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), oruse no more than one client per process.## 0.3.1 (2019-04-16)**Bugfixes**  - Fix expressionValues and targetValues type## 0.3.0 (2019-03-12)**Features**  - Model QueryOptions has a new parameter expand  - Model PolicyState has a new parameter policy_evaluation_details  - Model PolicyState has a new parameter compliance_state## 0.2.0 (2019-01-02)**Features**  - Added operation group RemediationsOperations  - Added operation group PolicyTrackedResourcesOperations## 0.1.0 (2018-05-04)  - Initial Release</longdescription>
