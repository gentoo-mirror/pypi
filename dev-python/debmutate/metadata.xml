	<longdescription>Debmutate is a set of Python modules for manipulating the control files ofDebian packages, with the ability to preserve the existing formatting ofthe control files.It's built on top of the excellent[python-debian](https://salsa.debian.org/python-debian-team/python-debian)library, and was originally extracted from[lintian-brush](https://salsa.debian.org/jelmer/lintian-brush).To modify one of the control files, use one of the context managers to edit the file.For example, for debian/control:```pythonfrom debmutate.control import ControlEditorwith ControlEditor(path='debian/control') as control:    print(control.source['Maintainer'])    control.source['Maintainer'] = &quot;Jelmer VernooÄ³ &lt;jelmer@debian.org&gt;&quot;```Or for debian/changelog:```pythonfrom debmutate.changelog import ChangelogEditorwith ChangelogEditor(path='debian/changelog') as editor:   editor.add_entry(['Some entry'])```Once you leave the context manager, the changes will be written to disk ifthere were any. If the editor is unable to preserve the formatting of thecontrol file, it will raise a FormattingUnpreservable error.If the control file that was edited was generated from another control file(e.g. debian/control.in), debmutate will attempt to update that file insteadand then regenerate debian/control. If it is unable to do so, it will raisea GeneratedFile exception.The file will be left as-is if an exception is raised, or if the .cancel()method is called.debmutate currently provides editors for the following control files: * debian/changelog * debian/copyright * debian/control * debian/patches/series * debian/tests/control * debian/watch * debian/maintscripts, debian/\*.maintscripts * debian/source/lintian-overrides, debian/\*.lintian-overrides * debian/debcargo.toml</longdescription>
