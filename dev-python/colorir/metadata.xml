	<longdescription>.. note::    colorir is still in its early days and slight modifications to the API may happen between versions.What is colorir?----------------colorir is a package that allows users to manipulate colors and palettes.With colorir you can:- Create palettes and save them to use in different projects;- Have access to a curated selection of unique color palettes and color names;- Easily convert between different color systems and formats;- Create gradients between colors and sample from them;- Easily visualize swatches of colors in the terminal;- Pass color values directly as input for other graphical or web frameworks;- And more!colorir was designed to be your best friend when dealing with colors so that you won't ever need to write this kind of code again:.. code-block:: python    BLACK = (0, 0, 0)    WHITE = (255, 255, 255)    CSS_ALICEBLUE = (240, 248, 255)    BACKGROUND_COLOR = (11, 0, 51)    FONT_COLOR = (113, 180, 141)    LINE_PLOT_COLOR = (131, 34, 50)    # ... long and ugly list of colorsGetting Started---------------Getting started with colorir can be as simple as:.. code-block:: python    sky = Palette.load(&quot;sky&quot;)  # Loads a previously created palette called sky    sky_grad = PolarGrad([sky.sunrise, sky.highnoon])  # Creates a gradient from the color &quot;sunrise&quot; to the color &quot;highnoon&quot;    swatch(sky)  # Shows colorir objects in the terminal    swatch(sky_grad)This code should print both the palette and the gradient directly in your terminal:.. image:: docs/source/images/readme_sky.pngColorir can be used to interpolate and manipulate colors in many different color systems,such as CIELab and HCLab (LCHab).Now let's make a gray scale version of the sky palette and save it to use later onanother project:.. code-block:: python    gray_sky = sky.grayscale()    gray_sky.save(&quot;gray_sky&quot;)Now the gray_sky palette can be loaded with from a different script:.. code-block:: python    gray_sky = Palette.load(&quot;gray_sky&quot;)    swatch(gray_sky).. image:: docs/source/images/readme_gray_sky.pngFor more information (including use-cases and examples), see colorir's documentation `here &lt;https://colorir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_.</longdescription>
