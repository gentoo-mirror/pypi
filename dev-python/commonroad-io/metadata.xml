Thus, only key aspects are typically described in scientific publications, making it impossible to reproduce results - yet, reproducibility is an important asset of good science.Composable benchmarks for motion planning on roads (CommonRoad) are proposed so that numerical experiments are fully defined by a unique ID; all required information to reconstruct the experiment can be found on [commonroad.in.tum.de](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/).Each benchmark is composed of a [vehicle model](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-vehicle-models/blob/master/vehicleModels_commonRoad.pdf), a [cost function](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-cost-functions/blob/master/costFunctions_commonRoad.pdf), and a [scenario](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/scenarios/) (including goals and constraints). The scenarios are partly recorded from real traffic and partly hand-crafted to create dangerous situations. Solutions to the benchmarks can be uploaded and ranked on the CommonRoad Website.Learn more about the scenario specification [here](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-scenarios/blob/master/documentation/XML_commonRoad_2020a.pdf).# commonroad-ioThe commonroad-io package provides methods to read, write, and visualize CommonRoad scenarios and planning problems. Furthermore, it can be used as a framework for implementing motion planning algorithms to solve CommonRoad Benchmarks and is the basis for other tools of the CommonRoad Framework.With commonroad-io, those solutions can be written to xml-files for uploading them on [commonroad.in.tum.de](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/).commonroad-io 2023.1 is compatible with CommonRoad scenarios in version 2020a and supports reading 2018b scenarios.The software is written in Python and tested on Linux for the Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.## DocumentationThe full documentation of the API and introducing examples can be found under [commonroad.in.tum.de](https://commonroad-io.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).For getting started, we recommend our [tutorials](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/commonroad-io).## Additional ToolsBased on commonroad-io, we have developed a list of tools supporting the development of motion-planning algorithms:* [Drivability Checker](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/tools/drivability-checker)* [CommonRoad-SUMO Interface](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/tools/sumo-interface)* [Scenario Designer](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/tools/scenario-designer)* [Vehicle Models](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/tools/model-cost-functions)* [Dateset Converters](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/dataset-converters)* [Interactive Scenarios](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-interactive-scenarios)* [Apollo Interface](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-apollo-interface)## RequirementsThe required dependencies for running commonroad-io are:* numpy&gt;=1.13* scipy&gt;=1.5.2* shapely&gt;=2.0.1* matplotlib&gt;=2.2.2* lxml&gt;=4.2.2* networkx&gt;=2.2* Pillow&gt;=7.0.0* commonroad-vehicle-models&gt;=2.0.0* rtree&gt;=0.8.3* protobuf==3.20.1## Installationcommonroad-io can be installed with::pip install commonroad-ioAlternatively, clone from our gitlab repository::git clone https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad_io.gitand add the folder commonroad-io to your Python environment.## ChangelogCompared to version 2022.3, the following features have been added or changed:### Added- Support for shapely&gt;=2.0.0### Fixed- Writing scenarios without location to protobuf- Dashed lanelet boundaries with fixed dash position- Default plot limits for focused obstacle- Use dt from scenario as default for video creation- Apply axis visible-option also for video creation- Protobuf FileReader marking road network related IDs as used- State attribute comparison### Changed- Name of SIDEWALK and BUSLANE traffic signs to PEDESTRIAN_SIDEWALK and BUS_LANE- Packaging and dependency management using poetry## AuthorsContribution (in alphabetic order by last name): Yannick Ballnath, Behtarin Ferdousi, Luis Gressenbuch, Moritz Klischat, Markus Koschi, Sebastian Maierhofer, Stefanie Manzinger, Christina Miller, Christian Pek, Anna-Katharina Rettinger, Simon Sagmeister, Moritz Untersperger, Murat Üste, Xiao Wang## CreditsWe gratefully acknowledge partial financial support by* DFG (German Research Foundation) Priority Program SPP 1835 Cooperative Interacting Automobiles* BMW Group within the Car@TUM project* German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology through the research initiative Ko-HAF## Citation**If you use our code for research, please consider to cite our paper:**```@inproceedings{Althoff2017a,author = {Althoff, Matthias and Koschi, Markus and Manzinger, Stefanie},title = {CommonRoad: Composable benchmarks for motion planning on roads},booktitle = {Proc. of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium},year = {2017},abstract = {Numerical experiments for motion planning of road vehicles require numerous components: vehicle             dynamics, a road network, static obstacles, dynamic obstacles and their movement over time, goal             regions, a cost function, etc. Providing a description of the numerical experiment precise enough to             reproduce it might require several pages of information.
