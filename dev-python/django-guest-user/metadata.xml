Decorate your views with `@allow_guest_user`:   ```python   from guest_user.decorators import allow_guest_user   @allow_guest_user   def my_view(request):       assert request.user.is_authenticated       return render(request, &quot;my_view.html&quot;)   ```A more detailed guide is available in the[installation documentation](https://django-guest-user.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html#how-to-install).## ContributingAll contributions are welcome! Please read the[contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) in this repostory.## Development StatusThis project is under active development. Thanks to[previous work](https://github.com/danfairs/django-lazysignup) the corefunctionality is well-established and this package builds on top of it.This project was created because the original project has been in an inactivestate without major updates in a long time. The code base was rewritten withonly modern versions of Python and Django in mind.</longdescription>
