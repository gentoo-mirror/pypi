	<longdescription>This package provides standard functions for interacting with the Clowderopen source data management system. Clowder is designed to allow researchersto build customized catalogs in the clouds to help you manage research data.One of the most interesting aspects of Clowder is the ability to extractmetadata from any file. This ability is created using extractors. To make iteasy to create these extractors in python we have created a module calledclowder. Besides wrapping often used api calls in convenient python calls, wehave also added some code to make it easy to create new extractors.Installation------------Install using pip (for most recent versions see: https://pypi.org/project/pyclowder/):```pip install pyclowder==2.7.0```Install pyClowder on your system by cloning this repo:```git clone https://github.com/clowder-framework/pyclowder.gitcd pyclowderpip install -r requirements.txtpython setup.py install```or directly from GitHub:```pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clowder-framework/pyclowder/master/requirements.txt git+https://github.com/clowder-framework/pyclowder.git```Quickstart example------------------See the [README](https://github.com/clowder-framework/pyclowder/tree/master/sample-extractors/wordcount#readme)in `sample-extractors/wordcount`.
