	<longdescription># Copy number genotyping jointly from scRNA and scATAC sequencingA set of Pyro models and functions to infer CNA from scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. It comes with a companion [R package](https://github.com/caravagnalab/rcongas) that works as an interface and provides preprocessing, simulation and visualization routines.Currently providing:- A mixture model on segments where CNV are modelled as Categorical random variable (LatentCategorical) &lt;!--Coming soon:- A linear model in the emission that can account for known covariates- The equivalent of MixtureGaussian but with CNVs as Categorical random variable- A model on genes (all the other models assume a division in segments)--&gt;To install:`$ pip install congas`&lt;!--To run a simple analysis on the example data```pythonimport congas as cnfrom congas.models import MixtureGaussiandata_dict = cn.simulation_dataparams, loss = cn.run_analysis(data_dict,MixtureGaussian, steps=200, lr=0.05)```[Full Documentation](https://annealpyro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)--&gt;</longdescription>
