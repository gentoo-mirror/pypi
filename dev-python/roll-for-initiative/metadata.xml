	<longdescription># Roll for Initiative!![Roll for Initiative screenshot](images/rfi.png)## What is this?This is a terminal-based initiative tracker primarily aimed at Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition.I use the term &quot;initiative&quot; mostly for being recognizable, and most systems have something similar: a queue of actionsthat happen in order given a numeric value.[Jump to installation instructions](#installation)## MotivationAll initiative trackers I found only are bloated. They cram as many features as possible with little to no regards to UX.I'm going back to the basics: a CLI tool to manage initiative. No &quot;create encounter&quot;. No &quot;what is this creature's initiative bonus?&quot; popup.I hate the &quot;create encounter&quot; feature of these initiative trackers. I admit, this might be due to my GM style,but I don't want to plan every single encounter the night before. I don't know what my players will do, I need theflexibility to improvise.The main motivation for me to create this, really, is just so I have a clean interface with really shallow menusand **no setup time**. This is the project philosophy.## Quick tips- Type `help` or `help command` if you have any doubts.- Tab completion is your friend. After beginning to type a command, press tab to cycle through the suggestions.## FlowThis is a TL;DR. You can find more information after this.- Run `add name initiative` as many times as you like. `initiative` may be a number or a diceroll expression.  - Entries are ordered by their decreasing initiative value.  - If there is a tie, you can reorder them using `move lower_entry_name up` or `move upper_entry_name down`.- Any time you want to see the queue but it's not visible, run `show`.- Run `start`.- Press enter when the input field is empty to advance to next entry.- When a creature dies or for some other reason its entry is no longer relevant to the queue, type `remove dead_creature_name`.That's pretty much what you need to know to use it at a basic level.## Advanced usageTodo# InstallationTo install the `rfi` command to your user scope, run:```pip install --user --upgrade roll-for-initiative```If you want to install directly from source, you can do:```cd /path/to/target/source/dirgit clone https://github.com/wqferr/RFIcd RFIpip install --user --upgrade flitflit install -s```# Running itAfter installing it with either method, you can run it with `rfi` on linux, or with `python -m rfi.app`on any platform if that doesn't work.# Special thanksThis application is made using the following libraries and tools:- [flit](https://github.com/takluyver/flit) (build system)- [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) (virtual environment)- [texttable](https://github.com/foutaise/texttable/) (pretty text tables)- [dice](https://github.com/borntyping/python-dice) (dice rolling for `add` and `chinit`)</longdescription>
