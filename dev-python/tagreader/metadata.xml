It is intended to be easy to use,and present as similar interfaces as possible to the backend historians.While originally developed for Windows, Tagreader can since release 3.0.0also be used on Linux and Windows platforms.Queries can be performed using either REST API (preferred) or ODBC queries.The use of ODBC queries require installation of proprietary drivers fromAspenTech and OSIsoft that are only available for Windows.Trend data is output as Pandas Dataframes. The HDF5 file format is usedto cache results.## RequirementsPython &gt;=3.8 with the following packages:  + pandas &gt;= 1.0.0  + requests  + requests-kerberos  + certifi &gt;= 2023.5.7  + diskcache  + pyodbc (**)**) If using ODBC connections, you must also install proprietary drivers forPI ODBC and/or Aspen IP.21 SQLPlus. These drivers are only available forMicrosoft Windows. Pyodbc will therefore not be installed for non-Windowssystems.## InstallationTo install and/or upgrade:```pip install --upgrade tagreader```If you wish to use ODBC connections to the IMS servers, you will also needto install some proprietary drivers. There is more information in the[manual](docs/manual.md#odbc-drivers). Please note that the web APIs shouldnormally be preferred.## Usage example```import tagreaderc = tagreader.IMSClient(&quot;mysource&quot;, &quot;aspenone&quot;)print(c.search(&quot;tag*&quot;))df = c.read_tags([&quot;tag1&quot;, &quot;tag2&quot;], &quot;18.06.2020 08:00:00&quot;, &quot;18.06.2020 09:00:00&quot;, 60)```## Jupyter Notebook QuickstartJupyter Notebook examples can be found in /examples. In order to run these examples, you need to install the optionaldependencies.```bashpip install tagreader[notebooks]```## DocumentationThere is a [quickstart](examples/quickstart.ipynb) example file that should getyou going. Also check out the [manual](docs/manual.md) for more information.## ContributingAll contributions are welcome, including code, bug reports, issues, featurerequests, and documentation.
