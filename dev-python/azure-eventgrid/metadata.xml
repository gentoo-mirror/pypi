	<longdescription># Azure Event Grid client library for PythonAzure Event Grid is a fully-managed intelligent event routing service that allows for uniform event consumption using a publish-subscribe model.[Source code][python-eg-src]| [Package (PyPI)][python-eg-pypi]| [Package (Conda)](https://anaconda.org/microsoft/azure-eventgrid/)| [API reference documentation][python-eg-ref-docs]| [Product documentation][python-eg-product-docs]| [Samples][python-eg-samples]| [Changelog][python-eg-changelog]## Getting started### Prerequisites* Python 3.7 or later is required to use this package.* You must have an [Azure subscription][azure_subscription] and an Event Grid Topic resource to use this package. Follow this [step-by-step tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/custom-event-quickstart-portal) to register the Event Grid resource provider and create Event Grid topics using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). There is a [similar tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/custom-event-quickstart) using [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure).### Install the packageInstall the Azure Event Grid client library for Python with [pip][pip]:```bashpip install azure-eventgrid```* An existing Event Grid topic or domain is required. You can create the resource using [Azure Portal][azure_portal_create_EG_resource] or [Azure CLI][azure_cli_link]If you use Azure CLI, replace `&lt;resource-group-name&gt;` and `&lt;resource-name&gt;` with your own unique names.#### Create an Event Grid Topic```az eventgrid topic --create --location &lt;location&gt; --resource-group &lt;resource-group-name&gt; --name &lt;resource-name&gt;```#### Create an Event Grid Domain```az eventgrid domain --create --location &lt;location&gt; --resource-group &lt;resource-group-name&gt; --name &lt;resource-name&gt;```### Authenticate the clientIn order to interact with the Event Grid service, you will need to create an instance of a client.An **endpoint** and **credential** are necessary to instantiate the client object.#### Using Azure Active Directory (AAD)Azure Event Grid provides integration with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for identity-based authentication of requests. With Azure AD, you can use role-based access control (RBAC) to grant access to your Azure Event Grid resources to users, groups, or applications.To send events to a topic or domain with a `TokenCredential`, the authenticated identity should have the &quot;EventGrid Data Sender&quot; role assigned.With the `azure-identity` package, you can seamlessly authorize requests in both development and production environments. To learn more about Azure Active Directory, see the [`azure-identity` README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity/README.md).For example, you can use `DefaultAzureCredential` to construct a client which will authenticate using Azure Active Directory:&lt;!-- SNIPPET:sample_authentication.client_auth_with_token_cred --&gt;```pythonfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredentialfrom azure.eventgrid import EventGridPublisherClient, EventGridEventdefault_az_credential = DefaultAzureCredential()endpoint = os.environ[&quot;EVENTGRID_TOPIC_ENDPOINT&quot;]client = EventGridPublisherClient(endpoint, default_az_credential)```&lt;!-- END SNIPPET --&gt;#### Looking up the endpointYou can find the topic endpoint within the Event Grid Topic resource on the Azure portal. This will look like:`&quot;https://&lt;event-grid-topic-name&gt;.&lt;topic-location&gt;.eventgrid.azure.net/api/events&quot;`#### Create the client with AzureKeyCredentialTo use an Access key as the `credential` parameter,pass the key as a string into an instance of [AzureKeyCredential][azure-key-credential].&gt; **Note:** The Access Key may be found in the azure portal in the &quot;Access Keys&quot; menu of the Event Grid Topic resource.  They may also be obtained via the azure CLI, or the `azure-mgmt-eventgrid` library. A guide for getting access keys can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/get-access-keys).&lt;!-- SNIPPET:sample_authentication.client_auth_with_key_cred --&gt;```pythonimport osfrom azure.eventgrid import EventGridPublisherClientfrom azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredentialtopic_key = os.environ[&quot;EVENTGRID_TOPIC_KEY&quot;]endpoint = os.environ[&quot;EVENTGRID_TOPIC_ENDPOINT&quot;]credential_key = AzureKeyCredential(topic_key)client = EventGridPublisherClient(endpoint, credential_key)```&lt;!-- END SNIPPET --&gt;&gt; **Note:** A client may also be authenticated via SAS signature, using the `AzureSasCredential`. A sample demonstrating this, is available [here][python-eg-sample-send-using-sas] ([async_version][python-eg-sample-send-using-sas-async]).&gt; **Note:** The `generate_sas` method can be used to generate a shared access signature. A sample demonstrating this can be seen [here][python-eg-generate-sas].## Key concepts### TopicA **[topic](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/concepts#topics)** is a channel within the EventGrid service to send events. The event schema that a topic accepts is decided at topic creation time. If events of a schema type are sent to a topic that requires a different schema type, errors will be raised.### DomainAn event **[domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/event-domains)** is a management tool for large numbers of Event Grid topics related to the same application. They allow you to publish events to thousands of topics. Domains also give you authorization and authentication control over each topic. For more information, visit [Event domain overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/event-domains).When you create an event domain, a publishing endpoint for this domain is made available to you. This process is similar to creating an Event Grid Topic. The only difference is that, when publishing to a domain, you must specify the topic within the domain that you'd like the event to be delivered to.### Event schemasAn **[event](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/concepts#events)** is the smallest amount of information that fully describes something that happened in the system. When a custom topic or domain is created, you must specify the schema that will be used when publishing events.Event Grid supports multiple schemas for encoding events.#### Event Grid schemaWhile you may configure your topic to use a [custom schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/input-mappings), it is more common to use the already-defined Event Grid schema. See the specifications and requirements [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/event-schema).#### CloudEvents v1.0 schemaAnother option is to use the CloudEvents v1.0 schema. [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation project which produces a specification for describing event data in a common way. The service summary of CloudEvents can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/cloud-event-schema).### EventGridPublisherClient`EventGridPublisherClient` provides operations to send event data to a topic hostname specified during client initialization.Regardless of the schema that your topic or domain is configured to use, `EventGridPublisherClient` will be used to publish events to it. Use the `send` method publishing events.The following formats of events are allowed to be sent:- A list or a single instance of strongly typed EventGridEvents.- A dict representation of a serialized EventGridEvent object.- A list or a single instance of strongly typed CloudEvents.- A dict representation of a serialized CloudEvent object.- A dict representation of any Custom Schema.Please have a look at the [samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/eventgrid/azure-eventgrid/samples) for detailed examples. **Note:** It is important to know if your topic supports CloudEvents or EventGridEvents before publishing. If you send to a topic that does not support the schema of the event you are sending, send() will throw an exception.### System TopicsA **[system topic](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/system-topics)** in Event Grid represents one or more events published by Azure services such as Azure Storage or Azure Event Hubs. For example, a system topic may represent all blob events or only blob creation and blob deletion events published for a specific storage account.The names of the various event types for the system events published to Azure Event Grid are available in `azure.eventgrid.SystemEventNames`.For complete list of recognizable system topics, visit [System Topics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/system-topics). For more information about the key concepts on Event Grid, see [Concepts in Azure Event Grid][publisher-service-doc].## Event Grid on Kubernetes with Azure ArcEvent Grid on Kubernetes with Azure Arc is an offering that allows you to run Event Grid on your own Kubernetes cluster. This capability is enabled by the use of Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes. Through Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes, a supported Kubernetes cluster connects to Azure. Once connected, you are able to install Event Grid on it. Learn more about it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/kubernetes/overview).### Support for CNCF Cloud EventsStarting with v4.7.0, this package also supports publishing a CNCF cloud event from https://pypi.org/project/cloudevents/. You would be able to pass a CloudEvent object from this library to the `send` API.```pythonfrom cloudevents.http import CloudEventevent = CloudEvent(...)client.send(event)```## ExamplesThe following sections provide several code snippets covering some of the most common Event Grid tasks, including:* [Send an Event Grid Event](#send-an-event-grid-event)* [Send a Cloud Event](#send-a-cloud-event)* [Send Multiple Events](#send-multiple-events)* [Send events as Dictionaries](#send-events-as-dictionaries)* [Consume a payload from storage queue](#consume-from-storage-queue)* [Consume from ServiceBus](#consume-from-servicebus)### Send an Event Grid EventThis example publishes an Event Grid event.```pythonimport osfrom azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredentialfrom azure.eventgrid import EventGridPublisherClient, EventGridEventkey = os.environ[&quot;EG_ACCESS_KEY&quot;]endpoint = os.environ[&quot;EG_TOPIC_HOSTNAME&quot;]event = EventGridEvent(    data={&quot;team&quot;: &quot;azure-sdk&quot;},    subject=&quot;Door1&quot;,    event_type=&quot;Azure.Sdk.Demo&quot;,    data_version=&quot;2.0&quot;)credential = AzureKeyCredential(key)client = EventGridPublisherClient(endpoint, credential)client.send(event)```### Send a Cloud EventThis example publishes a Cloud event.```pythonimport osfrom azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredentialfrom azure.core.messaging import CloudEventfrom azure.eventgrid import EventGridPublisherClientkey = os.environ[&quot;CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY&quot;]endpoint = os.environ[&quot;CLOUD_TOPIC_HOSTNAME&quot;]event = CloudEvent(    type=&quot;Azure.Sdk.Sample&quot;,    source=&quot;https://egsample.dev/sampleevent&quot;,    data={&quot;team&quot;: &quot;azure-sdk&quot;})credential = AzureKeyCredential(key)client = EventGridPublisherClient(endpoint, credential)client.send(event)```### Send Multiple eventsIt is possible to send events as a batch when sending multiple events to a topic or a domain. This example sends a list of CloudEvents using the send method.**WARNING:** When sending a list of multiple events at one time, iterating over and sending each event will not result in optimal performance. For best performance, it is highly recommended to send a list of events.```pythonimport osfrom azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredentialfrom azure.core.messaging import CloudEventfrom azure.eventgrid import EventGridPublisherClientkey = os.environ[&quot;CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY&quot;]endpoint = os.environ[&quot;CLOUD_TOPIC_HOSTNAME&quot;]event0 = CloudEvent(    type=&quot;Azure.Sdk.Sample&quot;,    source=&quot;https://egsample.dev/sampleevent&quot;,    data={&quot;team&quot;: &quot;azure-sdk&quot;})event1 = CloudEvent(    type=&quot;Azure.Sdk.Sample&quot;,    source=&quot;https://egsample.dev/sampleevent&quot;,    data={&quot;team2&quot;: &quot;azure-eventgrid&quot;})events = [event0, event1]credential = AzureKeyCredential(key)client = EventGridPublisherClient(endpoint, credential)client.send(events)```### Send events as dictionariesA dict representation of respective serialized models can also be used to publish CloudEvent(s) or EventGridEvent(s) apart from the strongly typed objects.Use a dict-like representation to send to a topic with custom schema as shown below.```pythonimport osimport uuidimport datetime as dtfrom msrest.serialization import UTCfrom azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredentialfrom azure.eventgrid import EventGridPublisherClientkey = os.environ[&quot;CUSTOM_SCHEMA_ACCESS_KEY&quot;]endpoint = os.environ[&quot;CUSTOM_SCHEMA_TOPIC_HOSTNAME&quot;]event = custom_schema_event = {    &quot;customSubject&quot;: &quot;sample&quot;,    &quot;customEventType&quot;: &quot;sample.event&quot;,    &quot;customDataVersion&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;,    &quot;customId&quot;: uuid.uuid4(),    &quot;customEventTime&quot;: dt.datetime.now(UTC()).isoformat(),    &quot;customData&quot;: &quot;sample data&quot;    }credential = AzureKeyCredential(key)client = EventGridPublisherClient(endpoint, credential)client.send(event)```### Consume from storage queueThis example consumes a message received from storage queue and deserializes it to a CloudEvent object.```pythonfrom azure.core.messaging import CloudEventfrom azure.storage.queue import QueueServiceClient, BinaryBase64DecodePolicyimport osimport json# all types of CloudEvents below produce same DeserializedEventconnection_str = os.environ['STORAGE_QUEUE_CONN_STR']queue_name = os.environ['STORAGE_QUEUE_NAME']with QueueServiceClient.from_connection_string(connection_str) as qsc:    payload =  qsc.get_queue_client(        queue=queue_name,        message_decode_policy=BinaryBase64DecodePolicy()        ).peek_messages()    ## deserialize payload into a list of typed Events    events = [CloudEvent.from_dict(json.loads(msg.content)) for msg in payload]```### Consume from servicebusThis example consumes a payload message received from ServiceBus and deserializes it to an EventGridEvent object.```pythonfrom azure.eventgrid import EventGridEventfrom azure.servicebus import ServiceBusClientimport osimport json# all types of EventGridEvents below produce same DeserializedEventconnection_str = os.environ['SERVICE_BUS_CONN_STR']queue_name = os.environ['SERVICE_BUS_QUEUE_NAME']with ServiceBusClient.from_connection_string(connection_str) as sb_client:    payload =  sb_client.get_queue_receiver(queue_name).receive_messages()    ## deserialize payload into a list of typed Events    events = [EventGridEvent.from_dict(json.loads(next(msg.body).decode('utf-8'))) for msg in payload]```## Distributed Tracing with EventGridYou can use OpenTelemetry for Python as usual with EventGrid since it's compatible with azure-core tracing integration.Here is an example of using OpenTelemetry to trace sending a CloudEvent.First, set OpenTelemetry as enabled tracing plugin for EventGrid.```pythonfrom azure.core.settings import settingsfrom azure.core.tracing.ext.opentelemetry_span import OpenTelemetrySpansettings.tracing_implementation = OpenTelemetrySpan```Regular open telemetry usage from here. See [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python) for details.This example uses a simple console exporter to export the traces. Any exporter can be used here including `azure-monitor-opentelemetry-exporter`, `jaeger`, `zipkin` etc.```pythonfrom opentelemetry import tracefrom opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProviderfrom opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporterfrom opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor  # this requires opentelemetry &gt;= 1.0.0# Simple console exporterexporter = ConsoleSpanExporter()trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(    SimpleSpanProcessor(exporter))```Once the `tracer` and `exporter` are set, please follow the example below to start collecting traces while using the `send` method from the `EventGridPublisherClient` to send a CloudEvent object.```pythonimport osfrom azure.eventgrid import EventGridPublisherClientfrom azure.core.messaging import CloudEventfrom azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredentialhostname = os.environ['CLOUD_TOPIC_HOSTNAME']key = AzureKeyCredential(os.environ['CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY'])cloud_event = CloudEvent(    source = 'demo',    type = 'sdk.demo',    data = {'test': 'hello'},)with tracer.start_as_current_span(name=&quot;MyApplication&quot;):    client = EventGridPublisherClient(hostname, key)    client.send(cloud_event)```## Troubleshooting- Enable `azure.eventgrid` logger to collect traces from the library.### GeneralEvent Grid client library will raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core][azure_core_exceptions].### LoggingThis library uses the standard[logging][python_logging] library for logging.Basic information about HTTP sessions (URLs, headers, etc.) is logged at INFOlevel.### Optional ConfigurationOptional keyword arguments can be passed in at the client and per-operation level.The azure-core [reference documentation][azure_core_ref_docs]describes available configurations for retries, logging, transport protocols, and more.## Next stepsThe following section provides several code snippets illustrating common patterns used in the Event Grid Python API.### More sample codeThese code samples show common champion scenario operations with the Azure Event Grid client library.* Generate Shared Access Signature: [sample_generate_sas.py][python-eg-generate-sas]* Authenticate the client: [sample_authentication.py][python-eg-auth] ([async_version][python-eg-auth-async])* Publish events to a topic using SAS: [sample_publish_events_to_a_topic_using_sas_credential_async.py][python-eg-sample-send-using-sas] ([async_version][python-eg-sample-send-using-sas-async])* Publish Event Grid Events to a topic: [sample_publish_eg_events_to_a_topic.py][python-eg-sample-eg-event] ([async_version][python-eg-sample-eg-event-async])* Publish EventGrid Events to a domain topic: [sample_publish_eg_events_to_a_domain_topic.py][python-eg-sample-eg-event-to-domain] ([async_version][python-eg-sample-eg-event-to-domain-async])* Publish a Cloud Event: [sample_publish_events_using_cloud_events_1.0_schema.py][python-eg-sample-send-cloudevent] ([async_version][python-eg-sample-send-cloudevent-async])* Publish a Custom Schema: [sample_publish_custom_schema_to_a_topic.py][python-eg-publish-custom-schema] ([async_version][python-eg-publish-custom-schema-async])The following samples cover publishing and consuming `dict` representations of EventGridEvents and CloudEvents.* Publish EventGridEvent as dict like representation: [sample_publish_eg_event_using_dict.py][python-eg-sample-send-eg-as-dict] ([async_version][python-eg-sample-send-eg-as-dict-async])* Publish CloudEvent as dict like representation: [sample_publish_cloud_event_using_dict.py][python-eg-sample-send-cloudevent-as-dict] ([async_version][python-eg-sample-send-cloudevent-as-dict-async])* Consume a Custom Payload of raw cloudevent data: [sample_consume_custom_payload.py][python-eg-sample-consume-custom-payload]More samples can be found [here][python-eg-samples].* More samples related to the send scenario can be seen [here][python-eg-publish-samples].* To see more samples related to consuming a payload from different messaging services as a typed object, please visit [Consume Samples][python-eg-consume-samples]### Additional documentationFor more extensive documentation on Azure Event Grid, see the [Event Grid documentation][python-eg-product-docs] on docs.microsoft.com.## ContributingThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

Please see the samples to see how events can be deserialized.  - `CustomEvent` model is removed. Dictionaries must be used to send a custom schema.  **Bug Fixes**  - `EventGridEvent` has two additional required positional parameters namely, `data` and `data_version`.  - `EventGridPublisherClient` now appropriately throws a `ValueError` if an invalid credential is passed during initialization.## 2.0.0b4 (2020-11-11)  **Bug Fixes**  - `TypeError` is raised when bytes are passed to an `EventGridEvent`.## 2.0.0b3 (2020-10-05)  **Feature**  - Added support for Keyvault Event Types  - Added distributed tracing support for CloudEvents## 2.0.0b2 (2020-09-24)  **Features**  - Added support for Azure Communication Services event types.## 2.0.0b1 (2020-09-08)  **Features**  - Version (2.0.0b1) is the first preview of our efforts to create a user-friendly and Pythonic client library for Azure EventGrid.  For more information about this, and preview releases of other Azure SDK libraries, please visit https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/python.html.  - Added Support for `CloudEvents`.  - Implements the `EventGridPublisherClient` for the publish flow for EventGrid Events, CloudEvents and CustomEvents.  - Implements the `EventGridConsumer` for the consume flow of the events.## 1.3.0 (2019-05-20)  - Event Schemas for new event types from IotHub, Media Services,    Container Registry, Maps, and AppConfiguration services.## 1.2.0 (2018-08-28)  - Event Schemas for new events (IotHub DeviceConnected and    DeviceDisconnected events, Resource events related to actions), and    breaking changes to the schema for IotHub DeviceCreated event and    IotHub DeviceDeleted event.## 1.1.0 (2018-05-24)  - Event Schemas for EventGrid subscription validation event, Azure    Media events, and ServiceBus events.## 1.0.0 (2018-04-26)**General Breaking changes**This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*introduce breaking changes.  - Model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. All    positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments. To    keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for    Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 uses the &quot;*&quot; syntax for    keyword-only arguments.  - Enum types now use the &quot;str&quot; mixin (class AzureEnum(str, Enum)) to    improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.    While this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important,    and are documented here:    &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others&gt; At a glance:      - &quot;is&quot; should not be used at all.      - &quot;format&quot; will return the string value, where &quot;%s&quot; string        formatting will return `NameOfEnum.stringvalue`. Format syntax        should be preferred.  - New Long Running Operation:      - Return type changes from        `msrestazure.azure_operation.AzureOperationPoller` to        `msrest.polling.LROPoller`. External API is the same.      - Return type is now **always** a `msrest.polling.LROPoller`,        regardless of the optional parameters used.      - The behavior has changed when using `raw=True`. Instead of        returning the initial call result as `ClientRawResponse`,        without polling, now this returns an LROPoller. After polling,        the final resource will be returned as a `ClientRawResponse`.      - New `polling` parameter. The default behavior is        `Polling=True` which will poll using ARM algorithm. When        `Polling=False`, the response of the initial call will be        returned without polling.      - `polling` parameter accepts instances of subclasses of        `msrest.polling.PollingMethod`.      - `add_done_callback` will no longer raise if called after        polling is finished, but will instead execute the callback right        away.**Features**  - Client class can be used as a context manager to keep the underlying    HTTP session open for performance  - Support for consuming Azure Container Registry events and Azure IoT    Hub events published to Event Grid.## 0.1.0 (2018-01-30)  - Initial Release</longdescription>
