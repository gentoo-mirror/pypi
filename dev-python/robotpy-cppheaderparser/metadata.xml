	<longdescription>robotpy-cppheaderparser=======================**robotpy-cppheaderparser is DEPRECATED, and we are no longer updating it**.We will accept pull requests that have fixes and appropriate tests, but wewill no longer be making any fixes ourselves.We highly recommend all current and future users to migrate to cxxheaderparser,which supports all the syntax that CppHeaderParser does and much much more. Theparser output is very different, but it is strictly typed and hopefully easierto work with. You can find it at https://github.com/robotpy/cxxheaderparser,or try the live interactive demo at https://robotpy.github.io/cxxheaderparser/---------CppHeaderParser is a pure python C++ header parser that parses C++headers and creates a data structure that you can use to do many typesof things. We’ve found it particularly useful for creating programs thatgenerate python wrappers around existing C++ programs.robotpy-cppheaderparser is a fork of the `CppHeaderParser`_ libraryoriginally created by @senex. CppHeaderParser is an excellent libraryand critical to some of the stuff we do in the RobotPy project.Unfortunately, the maintainer seems to be busy, sorobotpy-cppheaderparser was born.We aim to maintain (some) compatibility with the existing code and makeimprovements and bugfixes as we need them -- though some decisions madeearly on in this code's development means some compatibility may be brokenas things get fixed.If you find an bug, we encourage you to submit a pull request! Newchanges will only be accepted if there are tests to cover the change youmade (and if they don’t break existing tests)... note:: CppHeaderParser only does some very minimal interpretation of          preprocessor directives -- and we're looking at removing some          of that from this library. If you need anything complex, you          should preprocess the code yourself. You can use the excellent          pure python preprocessor `pcpp`_, or the preprocessing facilities          provided by your favorite compiler.Documentation-------------Documentation can be found at https://cppheaderparser.readthedocs.ioInstall-------::   pip install robotpy-cppheaderparserLicense-------BSD LicenseAuthors-------Originally developed by Jashua Cloutier, this fork is maintained by theRobotPy project.Past contributors include:* Jashua Cloutier* Chris Love* HartsAntler.. _CppHeaderParser: https://bitbucket.org/senex/cppheaderparser.. _pcpp: https://github.com/ned14/pcpp</longdescription>
