	<longdescription>TCLab: Temperature Control Laboratory=====================================Master:.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/jckantor/TCLab.svg?branch=master    :target: https://travis-ci.org/jckantor/TCLab.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/tclab/badge/?version=latest    :target: http://tclab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/tclab.svg    :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/tclabDevelopment:.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/jckantor/TCLab.svg?branch=development    :target: https://travis-ci.org/jckantor/TCLab``TCLab`` provides a Python interface to the`Temperature Control Lab &lt;http://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl&gt;`_implemented on an Arduino microcontroller over a USB interface.``TCLab`` is implemented as a Python class withinthe ``tclab`` package.  The ``tclab`` package also includes:* ``clock`` A Python generator for soft real-time implementation of  process control algorithms.* ``Historian`` A Python class to log results of a process control  experiment.* ``Plotter`` Provides an historian with real-time plotting within a  Jupyter notebook.* ``TCLabModel`` An embedded model of the temperature control lab  for off-line and faster-than-realtime simulation of process control  experiments. No hardware needs to be attached to use ``TCLabModel``.The companion Arduino firmware for device operation is available at the`TCLab-Sketch repository &lt;https://github.com/jckantor/TCLab-sketch&gt;`_.The `Arduino Temperature Control Lab &lt;http://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl&gt;`_is a modular, portable, and inexpensive solution for hands-on processcontrol learning.  Heat output is adjusted by modulating current flow toeach of two transistors. Thermistors measure the temperatures. Energyfrom the transistor output is transferred by conduction and convectionto the temperature sensor. The dynamics of heat transfer provide richopportunities to implement single and multivariable control systems.The lab is integrated into a small PCB shield which can be mounted toany `Arduino &lt;https://www.arduino.cc/&gt;`_ or Arduino compatiblemicrocontroller.Installation------------Install using ::   pip install tclabTo upgrade an existing installation, use the command ::   pip install tclab --upgradeThe development version contains new features, but may be less stable. To install the development version use the command ::   pip install --upgrade https://github.com/jckantor/TCLab/archive/development.zipHardware setup--------------1. Plug a compatible Arduino device (UNO, Leonardo, NHduino) with the   lab attached into your computer via the USB connection. Plug the DC   power adapter into the wall.2. (optional) Install Arduino Drivers   *If you are using Windows 10, the Arduino board should connect   without additional drivers required.*   For Arduino clones using the CH340G, CH34G or CH34X chipset you may need additional drivers. Only install these if you see a message saying &quot;No Arduino device found.&quot; when connecting.   * `macOS &lt;https://github.com/adrianmihalko/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver&gt;`__.   * `Windows &lt;http://www.wch.cn/downfile/65&gt;`__.3. (optional) Install Arduino Firmware   ``TCLab`` requires the one-time installation of custom firmware on   an Arduino device. If it hasn't been pre-installed, the necessary   firmware and instructions are available from the   `TCLab-Sketch repository &lt;https://github.com/jckantor/TCLab-sketch&gt;`_.Checking that everything works------------------------------Execute the following code ::    import tclab    with tclab.TCLab() as lab:        print(lab.T1)If everything has worked, you should see the following output message ::    Connecting to TCLab    TCLab Firmware Version 1.2.1 on NHduino connected to port XXXX    21.54    TCLab disconnected successfully.The number returned is the temperature of sensor T1 in Â°C.Troubleshooting---------------If something went wrong in the above process, refer to our troubleshooting guidein TROUBLESHOOTING.md.Next Steps----------The notebook directory provides examples on how to use the TCLab module.The latest documentation is available at`Read the Docs &lt;http://tclab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html&gt;`_.Course Websites---------------Additional information, instructional videos, and Jupyter notebookexamples are available at the following course websites.* `Arduino temperature control lab page &lt;http://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl&gt;`__ on the BYU Process Dynamics and Control course website.* `CBE 30338 &lt;http://jckantor.github.io/CBE30338/&gt;`__ for the Notre Dame  Chemical Process Control course website.* `Dynamics and Control &lt;https://github.com/alchemyst/Dynamics-and-Control&gt;`__ for notebooks developed at the University of Pretoria.</longdescription>
