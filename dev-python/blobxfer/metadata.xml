With `blobxfer` you can copy your files into or out of AzureStorage with the CLI or integrate the `blobxfer` data movement library intoyour own Python scripts.## Major Features* Command-line interface (CLI) providing data movement capability to andfrom Azure Blob and File Storage* Standalone library for integration with scripts or other Python packages* High-performance design with asynchronous transfers and disk I/O* Supports ingress, egress and synchronization of entire directories,containers and file shares* YAML configuration driven execution support* Fine-grained resume support including resuming a broken operationwithin a file or object* Vectored IO support    * `stripe` mode allows striping a single file across multiple blobs (even      to multiple storage accounts) to break through single blob or fileshare      throughput limits    * `replica` mode allows replication of a file across multiple destinations      including to multiple storage accounts* Synchronous copy with cross-mode (object transform) replication support    * Leverages server-side copies by default    * Arbitrary URL copy support* Client-side encryption support* Support all Azure Blob types and Azure Files for both upload and download* Advanced skip options for rsync-like operations* Store/restore POSIX filemode and uid/gid* Support reading/pipe from `stdin` including to page blob destinations* Support reading from blob and file share snapshots for downloading andsynchronous copy* Support for setting access tier on objects for uploading and synchronouscopy* Configurable one-shot block upload support* Configurable chunk size for both upload and download* Automatic block size selection for block blob uploading* Automatic uploading of VHD/VHDX files as page blobs* Include and exclude filtering support* Rsync-like delete support* No clobber support in either direction* Automatic content type tagging* Support for setting the Cache Control property of blobs and files* File logging support* Support for HTTP proxies## InstallationThere are three ways to install `blobxfer`:* `blobxfer` Python package from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blobxfer)* Pre-built binaries available under [Releases](https://github.com/Azure/blobxfer/releases)* Docker images are available for both Linux and Windows platforms on the[Microsoft Container Registry](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-blobxfer)Please refer to the[installation guide](http://blobxfer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01-installation/)for more information on how to install `blobxfer`.## DocumentationPlease refer to the [`blobxfer` documentation](http://blobxfer.readthedocs.io/)for more details and usage information.## Change LogPlease see the[Change Log](http://blobxfer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CHANGELOG/)for project history.## SupportThis project is community supported and not officially supported by Microsoft.There is no defined SLA for addressing features, issues, and bugs which areexclusively serviced via GitHub issues.
