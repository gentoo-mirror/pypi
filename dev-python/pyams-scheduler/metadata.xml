Doctests are available in the *doctests* source folder.What is PyAMS scheduler?========================PyAMS_scheduler is an extension package for PyAMS which can be used to handle tasks scheduling.The kind of tasks that can be scheduled are local commands, remote commands started throughSSH, HTTP or HTTPS remote services, REST APIs, SQL commands, files transfers, or customcommands that can be provided by special extension packages; you can also create pipelines,where the output of a command can be used as input for the next command.The tasks definition is stored into the ZODB, as well as the execution history of each task.The package relies on ZeroMQ for process synchronisation, and APScheduler for tasks scheduling.Changelog=========2.0.0----- - upgraded to Pyramid 2.01.11.0------ - added support for API keys authentication in REST tasks - added support for custom HTTP headers in REST tasks1.10.2------ - added check for broken tasks on application start - added support for scheduler configuration from Pyramid settings file - added support for Python 3.111.10.1------ - added content-type property to REST service client task1.10.0------ - allow usage of dynamic text formatters into scheduler HTTP client tasks1.9.1----- - use new PyAMS_security constant1.9.0----- - added new status to be used on task execution failure - added new task status class mapping1.8.0----- - added exception class to handle task execution errors - updated notification status on task execution error1.7.1----- - updated JWT tokens handler in REST API client task1.7.0----- - added properties to REST API client task to set login and password attributes of   JWT authentication service1.6.7----- - updated Gitlab-CI for Python 3.101.6.6----- - added support for Python 3.10 - PyAMS_security interfaces refactoring - use new ZMI attribute switcher column in task notifications1.6.5----- - check job next run time when getting list of scheduled jobs - added ping message handler to check process communication1.6.4----- - use constants to define tasks schedule modes - use new generic ZMI columns classes in notifications management view1.6.3----- - translation update1.6.2----- - updated new request base URL when running a task to be able to generate correct   absolute URLs1.6.1----- - added check for correct host configuration before sending notifications1.6.0----- - added support for *PyAMS_chat* package to send notifications after task execution1.5.0----- - replaced after-commit hooks with new PyAMS_utils transaction manager - added option to display scheduler access menu in site home1.4.3----- - updated history item view form CSS class1.4.2----- - version mismatch1.4.1----- - added return link to site utilities view from scheduler tasks view1.4.0----- - added scheduler label adapter - updated add and edit forms title - updated package include scan1.3.3----- - updated menus order in management interface - replace ITableElementName interface with IObjectLabel1.3.2----- - reset task internal ID after cloning - corrected check on request registry when removing task1.3.1----- - added and updated task add and edit forms AJAX renderer - Pylint updates1.3.0----- - updated tasks notifications management, to be able to add new notifications modes   easily - moved all task related interfaces to pyams_scheduler.interfaces.task module1.2.1----- - corrected timezone error in task history check - added missing &quot;context&quot; argument to permission check - small updates in tasks management forms1.2.0----- - removed support for Python &lt; 3.7 - updated synchronizer exceptions - updated FTP synchronizer handler1.1.1----- - updated scheduler generations updater order1.1.0----- - added task copy hook - added action to duplicate an existing task1.0.1----- - updated Gitlab-CI configuration - removed Travis-CI configuration1.0.0----- - initial release</longdescription>
