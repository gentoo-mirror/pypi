	<longdescription># RecSim: A Configurable Recommender Systems Simulation PlatformRecSim is a configurable platform for authoring simulation environments forrecommender systems (RSs) that naturally supports **sequential interaction**with users. RecSim allows the creation of new environments that reflectparticular aspects of user behavior and item structure at a level of abstractionwell-suited to pushing the limits of current reinforcement learning (RL) and RStechniques in sequential interactive recommendation problems. Environments canbe easily configured that vary assumptions about: user preferences and itemfamiliarity; user latent state and its dynamics; and choice models and otheruser response behavior. We outline how RecSim offers value to RL and RSresearchers and practitioners, and how it can serve as a vehicle foracademic-industrial collaboration. For a detailed description of the RecSimarchitecture please read [Ie et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04847). Pleasecite the paper if you use the code from this repository in your work.### Bibtex```@article{ie2019recsim,    title={RecSim: A Configurable Simulation Platform for Recommender Systems},    author={Eugene Ie and Chih-wei Hsu and Martin Mladenov and Vihan Jain and Sanmit Narvekar and Jing Wang and Rui Wu and Craig Boutilier},    year={2019},    eprint={1909.04847},    archivePrefix={arXiv},    primaryClass={cs.LG}}```&lt;a id='Disclaimer'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;## DisclaimerThis is not an officially supported Google product.## What's new*   **12/13/2019:** Added (abstract) classes for both multi-user environments    and agents. Added bandit algorithms for generalized linear models.## Installation and Sample UsageIt is recommended to install RecSim using (https://pypi.org/project/recsim/):```shellpip install recsim```However, the latest version of Dopamine is not in PyPI as of December, 2019. Wewant to install the latest version from Dopamine's repository like the followingbefore we install RecSim. Note that Dopamine requires Tensorflow 1.15.0 which isthe final 1.x release including GPU support for Ubuntu and Windows.```pip install git+https://github.com/google/dopamine.git```Here are some sample commands you could use for testing the installation:```git clone https://github.com/google-research/recsimcd recsim/recsimpython main.py --logtostderr \  --base_dir=&quot;/tmp/recsim/interest_exploration_full_slate_q&quot; \  --agent_name=full_slate_q \  --environment_name=interest_exploration \  --episode_log_file='episode_logs.tfrecord' \  --gin_bindings=simulator.runner_lib.Runner.max_steps_per_episode=100 \  --gin_bindings=simulator.runner_lib.TrainRunner.num_iterations=10 \  --gin_bindings=simulator.runner_lib.TrainRunner.max_training_steps=100 \  --gin_bindings=simulator.runner_lib.EvalRunner.max_eval_episodes=5```You could then start a tensorboard and view the output```tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/recsim/interest_exploration_full_slate_q/ --port=2222```You could also find the simulated logs in /tmp/recsim/episode_logs.tfrecord## TutorialsTo get started, please check out our Colab tutorials. In[**RecSim: Overview**](recsim/colab/RecSim_Overview.ipynb),we give a brief overview about RecSim. We then talk about each configurablecomponent:[**environment**](recsim/colab/RecSim_Developing_an_Environment.ipynb)and[**recommender agent**](recsim/colab/RecSim_Developing_an_Agent.ipynb).## DocumentationPlease refer to the [white paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04847) for thehigh-level design.</longdescription>
