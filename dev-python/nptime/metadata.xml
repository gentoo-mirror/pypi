	<longdescription>Non-Pedantic Time*****************Python's &quot;datetime&quot; module has many uses, but it has a difficulty: youcan't do any arithmetic with &quot;datetime.time&quot;.  Only with&quot;datetime.datetime&quot;.  Now, there are good reasons for this:  &quot;Whattime will it be, 24 hours from now&quot; has a lot of corner cases,including daylight savings time, leap seconds, historical timezonechanges, and so on.  But sometimes you really *do* need the simplecase.  Sometimes the perfect is the enemy of the good.  And that's whyyou have this module.  This module will allow you to cocoon yourselfin the comforting illusion that, in 24 hours, it will be the same timeas it is right now.And what freedom this illusion gives you!  You can add a&quot;datetime.timedelta&quot; object to an &quot;nptime&quot; object, and it works! Itwill cycle around 24 hours, like modular arithmetic.  You can ask&quot;what time comes 1 day and 36 minutes after 12:24 pm?&quot; and it will letyou know: 1:00 pm. How lovely!&gt;&gt;&gt; from nptime import nptime&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import timedelta, date, datetime&gt;&gt;&gt; afternoon = nptime(12, 24) + timedelta(days=1, minutes=36)&gt;&gt;&gt; afternoonnptime(13, 0)&gt;&gt;&gt; str(afternoon)'13:00:00'Maybe we're talking about the afternoon of Guido van Rossum'sbirthday.  Lucky, we can combine &quot;nptime&quot; objects with &quot;date&quot; objects:&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.combine(date(1956, 1, 31), afternoon)datetime.datetime(1956, 1, 31, 13, 0)You can also ask &quot;How long is it between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM?  It surefeels like a million years!&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt; workday = nptime(hour=17) - nptime(hour=9)&gt;&gt;&gt; workdaydatetime.timedelta(0, 28800)&gt;&gt;&gt; print(workday)8:00:00Nope, only 8 hours, how strange.  Anyway, please use this module.  Itwill be convenient.  But don't use it when talking about concretetime, time in a particular place, or anything like that.  In fact, itdoesn't even notice &quot;datetime.tzinfo&quot; objects right now.  Good luck.Note: You can find the newest version at  https://github.com/tgs/nptime .
