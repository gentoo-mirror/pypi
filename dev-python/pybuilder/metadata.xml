If you want to build a pure Python project anduse the recommended directory layout, all you have to do is create a filebuild.py with the following content:```pythonfrom pybuilder.core import use_pluginuse_plugin(&quot;python.core&quot;)use_plugin(&quot;python.unittest&quot;)use_plugin(&quot;python.coverage&quot;)use_plugin(&quot;python.distutils&quot;)default_task = &quot;publish&quot;```See the [PyBuilder homepage](https://pybuilder.io) for more details anda list of plugins.## Release NotesThe release notes can be found [here](https://pybuilder.io/release-notes/).There will also be a git tag with each release. Please note that we do not currently promote tags to GitHub &quot;releases&quot;.## DevelopmentSee [Developing PyBuilder](https://pybuilder.io/documentation/developing-pybuilder)</longdescription>
