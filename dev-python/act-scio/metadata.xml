	<longdescription># act-scio2Scio v2 is a reimplementation of [Scio](https://github.com/mnemonic-no/act-scio) in Python3.Scio uses [tika](https://tika.apache.org) to extract text from documents (PDF, HTML, DOC, etc).The result is sent to the Scio Analyzer that extracts information using a combination of NLP(Natural Language Processing) and pattern matching.## Changelog### 0.0.42SCIO now supports setting TLP on data upload, to annotate documents with `tlp` tag. Documents downloaded by feeds will have a default TLP white, but this can be changed in the config for feeds.## Source codeThe source code the workers are available on [github](https://github.com/mnemonic-no/act-scio2).## SetupTo setup, first install from PyPi:```bashsudo pip3 install act-scio```You will also need to install [beanstalkd](https://beanstalkd.github.io/). On debian/ubuntu you can run:```bashsudo apt install beanstalkd```Configure beanstalk to accept larger payloads with the `-z` option. For red hat derived setups this can be configured in `/etc/sysconfig/beanstalkd`:```bashMAX_JOB_SIZE=-z 524288```You then need to install NLTK data files. A helper utility to do this is included:```bashscio-nltk-download```You will also need to create a default configuration:```bashscio-config user```## APITo run the api, execute:```bashscio-api```This will setup the API on 127.0.0.1:3000. Use `--port &lt;PORT&gt; and --host &lt;IP&gt;` to listen on another port and/or another interface.For documentation of the API endpoint see [API.md](API.md).## ConfigurationYou can create a default configuration using this command (should be run as the user running scio):```bashscio-config user```Common configuration can be found under ~/.config/scio/etc/scio.ini## Running Manually### Scio Tika ServerThe Scio Tika server reads jobs from the beanstalk tube `scio_doc` and the extracted text will be sent to the tube `scio_analyze`.The first time the server runs, it will download tika using maven. It will use a proxy if `$https_proxy` is set.```bashscio-tika-server````scio-tika-server` uses [tika-python](https://github.com/chrismattmann/tika-python) which depends on tika-server.jar. If your server has internet access, this will downloaded automatically. If not or you need proxy to connect to the internet, follow the instructions on &quot;Airagap Environment Setup&quot; here: [https://github.com/chrismattmann/tika-python](https://github.com/chrismattmann/tika-python). Currently only tested with tika-server version 2.7.0.### Scio Analyze ServerScio Analyze Server reads (by default) jobs from the beanstalk tube `scio_analyze`.```bashscio-analyze```You can also read directly from stdin like this:```bashecho &quot;The companies in the Bus; Finanical, Aviation and Automobile industry are large.&quot; | scio-analyze --beanstalk= --elasticsearch=```### Scio SubmitSubmit document (from file or URI) to `scio_api`.Example:```bashscio-submit \   --uri https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/848-DID-242/images/rpt-apt29-hammertoss.pdf \   --scio-baseuri http://localhost:3000/submit \   --tlp white```## Running as a serviceSystemd compatible service scripts can be found under examples/systemd.To install:```bashsudo cp examples/systemd/*.service /usr/lib/systemd/systemsudo systemctl enable scio-tika-serversudo systemctl enable scio-analyzesudo service start scio-tika-serversudo service start scio-analyze```## scio-feed cron jobTo continously fetch new content from feeds, you can add scio-feed to cron like this (make sure the directory $HOME/logs exists):```# Fetch scio feeds every hour0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/scio-feeds &gt;&gt; $HOME/logs/scio-feed.log.$(date +\%s) 2&gt;&amp;1# Delete logs from scio-feeds older than 7 days0 * * * * find $HOME/logs/ -name 'scio-feed.log.*' -mmin +10080 -exec rm {} \;```## Local developmentUse pip to install in [local development mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs). act-scio uses namespacing, so it is not compatible with using `setup.py install` or `setup.py develop`.In repository, run:```bashpip3 install --user -e .```</longdescription>
