	<longdescription>=========================================================== pycryptopp: a small number of good cryptography algorithms===========================================================Introduction and Licence========================Pycryptopp is a collection of Python interfaces to a few good cryptoalgorithms. It lives at https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/pycryptoppRECOMMENDED algorithms:• XSalsa20 ; from the Crypto++ library ; see pycryptopp.cipher.xsalsa20• Ed25519 ; from the supercop library ; see pycryptopp.publickey.ed25519DEPRECATED algorithms:The maintainers of pycryptopp intend to stop supporting these soon. Pleasemigrate away from depending on pycryptopp's implementation of thesealgorithms, or else write to us and offer some inducement to continuesupporting them.• RSA from the Crypto++ library ; see pycryptopp.publickey.rsa ; deprecated  in favor of Ed25519• Ecdsa from the Crypto++ library ; see pycryptopp.publickey.ecdsa ;  deprecated in favor of Ed25519• SHA-256 from the Crypto++ library ; see pycryptopp.hash.sha256 ; deprecated  in favor of the Python Standard Library's hashlib moduleLICENCE-------You may use this package under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or,at your option, any later version. You may use this package under theTransitive Grace Period Public Licence, version 1.0 or, at your option, anylater version. You may use this package under the MIT License.

See the file COPYING.SPL.txt for the terms ofthe Simple Permissive Licence.BUILDING--------To build it run &quot;python setup.py build&quot;. To test it run &quot;python setup.pytest&quot;. To install it into your system run &quot;python setup.py install&quot;. Tocreate a binary package run &quot;python setup.py bdist_egg&quot;.If &quot;python setup.py test&quot; doesn't print out &quot;PASSED&quot; and exit with exitcode 0 then there is something seriously wrong. Do not use this build ofpycryptopp. Please report the error to the tahoe-dev mailing list ²_.To see some simple benchmarks run &quot;python setup.py bench&quot;. If the &quot;pyutil&quot;library is installed then the benchmarks will include mean, best, worst, andquartiles of wall-clock time, else they will just report the mean wall-clocktime per operation.DOCUMENTATION-------------The documentation is in the docstrings. From a command-line, use &quot;pydocpycryptopp&quot;, &quot;pydoc pycryptopp.cipher&quot;, and so on. From within a Pythoninterpreter use &quot;help(pycryptopp)&quot;, &quot;help(pycryptopp.cipher)&quot;,&quot;help(pycryptopp.cipher.aes)&quot; and so on.The documentation for pycryptopp.publickey.ed25519 is in README.ed25519.rst,adapted from the upstream python-ed25519 library.CONTACT-------Please post to the tahoe-dev mailing list ²_ with comments about thispackage.BOOK REVIEW-----------If you are not already acquainted with how to use modern cryptography, readFerguson, Schneier, and Kohno “Cryptography Engineering”.  It is easy goingand will increase your understanding greatly.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS----------------Thanks to Wei Dai, Jeffrey Walton, and the other contributors toCrypto++, Andrew M.
