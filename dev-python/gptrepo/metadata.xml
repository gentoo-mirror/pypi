	<longdescription># gptrepoThis is a package of the very excellent [gptrepo](https://github.com/mpoon/gptrepo) by mpoon.Usage```pythonpip install gptrepogptrepo  # now output.txt should appear in the current directory```This tool concatenates through all the files in teh repo and adds ai prompts which can be used for chat gpt conversations.This will be particularly useful when chat gpt4-32k is release. Right now this will only work on very small repos.[![Linting](https://github.com/zackees/gptrepo/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zackees/gptrepo/actions/workflows/lint.yml)[![MacOS_Tests](https://github.com/zackees/gptrepo/actions/workflows/push_macos.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zackees/gptrepo/actions/workflows/push_macos.yml)[![Ubuntu_Tests](https://github.com/zackees/gptrepo/actions/workflows/push_ubuntu.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zackees/gptrepo/actions/workflows/push_ubuntu.yml)[![Win_Tests](https://github.com/zackees/gptrepo/actions/workflows/push_win.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zackees/gptrepo/actions/workflows/push_win.yml)`gptrepo` is a command-line tool that converts the contents of a Git repository into a text format, preserving the structure of the files and file contents. The generated output can be interpreted by AI language models, allowing them to process the repository's contents for various tasks, such as code review or documentation generation.## ContributingSome context around building this is [located here](https://github.com/mpoon/gptrepo/discussions/18). Appreciate any issues and pull requests in the spirit of having mostly GPT build out this tool. Using [ChatGPT Plus](https://chat.openai.com/) is recommended for quick access to GPT-4.## Getting StartedTo get started with `gptrepo`, follow these steps:1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.2. Clone or download the `gptrepo` repository.3. Navigate to the repository's root directory in your terminal.4. Run `gptrepo` with the following command:   ```bash   python gpt_repository_loader.py /path/to/git/repository   ```    Replace `/path/to/git/repository` with the path to the Git repository you want to process.5. The tool will generate an output.txt file containing the text representation of the repository. You can now use this file as input for AI language models or other text-based processing tasks.## Running TestsTo run the tests for `gptrepo`, follow these steps:1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.2. Navigate to the repository's root directory in your terminal.3. Run the tests with the following command:   ```bash   python -m unittest test_gpt_repository_loader.py   ```Now, the test harness is added to the `gptrepo` project. You can run the tests by executing the command `tox` in your terminal.## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.</longdescription>
