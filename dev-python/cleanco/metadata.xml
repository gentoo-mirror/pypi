	<longdescription># cleanco - clean organization names![Python package](https://github.com/psolin/cleanco/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)![CodeQL](https://github.com/psolin/cleanco/workflows/CodeQL/badge.svg)## What is it / what does it do?This is a Python package that processes company names, providing cleaned versions of thenames by stripping away terms indicating organization type (such as &quot;Ltd.&quot; or &quot;Corp&quot;).Using a database of organization type terms, It also provides an utility to deduce thetype of organization, in terms of US/UK business entity types (ie. &quot;limited liabilitycompany&quot; or &quot;non-profit&quot;).Finally, the system uses the term information to suggest countries the organization couldbe established in. For example, the term &quot;Oy&quot; in company name suggests it is establishedin Finland, whereas &quot;Ltd&quot; in company name could mean UK, US or a number of othercountries.## How do I install it?Just use 'pip install cleanco' if you have pip installed (as most systems do). Or download the zip distribution from this site, unzip it and then:* Mac: `cd` into it, and enter `sudo python setup.py install` along with your system password.* Windows: Same thing but without `sudo`.## How does it work?Let's look at some sample code. To get the base name of a business without legal suffix:    &gt;&gt;&gt; from cleanco import basename    &gt;&gt;&gt; business_name = &quot;Some Big Pharma, LLC&quot;    &gt;&gt;&gt; basename(business_name)    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'Some Big Pharma'Note that sometimes a name may have e.g. two different suffixes after one another. The cleancoterm data covers many of these, but you may want to run `basename()` twice on the name, just in case.If you want to use your custom terms, please see  `custom_basename()` that also provides some other ways to adjust how base name is produced.To get the business type or country:    &gt;&gt;&gt; from cleanco import typesources, matches    &gt;&gt;&gt; classification_sources = typesources()    &gt;&gt;&gt; matches(&quot;Some Big Pharma, LLC&quot;, classification_sources)    ['Limited Liability Company']To get the possible countries of jurisdiction:    &gt;&gt;&gt; from cleanco import countrysources, matches    &gt;&gt;&gt; classification_sources = countrysources()    &gt;&gt;&gt; matches(&quot;Some Big Pharma, LLC&quot;, classification_sources) Â´    ['United States of America', 'Philippines']## Are there bugs?See the issue tracker. If you find a bug or have enhancement suggestion or question, please file an issue and provide a PR if you can. For example, some of the company suffixes may be incorrect or there may be suffixes missing.To run tests, simply install the package and run `python setup.py test`. To run tests on multiple Python versions, install `tox` and run it (see the provided tox.ini).## Special thanks to:- Wikipedia's [Types of Business Entity article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_business_entity), where I spent hours of research.- Contributors: [Petri Savolainen](https://github.com/petri)</longdescription>
