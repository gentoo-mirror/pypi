	<longdescription># Tianocore Edk2 PyTool Library (edk2toollib)[![pypi]][_pypi][![codecov]][_codecov][![ci]][_ci][![docs]][_docs]This is a Tianocore maintained project consisting of a python library supportingUEFI firmware development.  This package's intent is to provide an easy way toorganize and share python code to facilitate reuse across environments, tools,and scripts.  Inclusion of this package and dependency management is bestmanaged using Pip/Pypi.This is a supplemental package and is not required to be used for edk2 builds.## Current Status[![codecov]][_codecov][![ci]][_ci]The code coverage and CI badges represent unit test status and the code coverageof those unit tests. We require 100% unit test success (Hence the pass / fail)and that code coverage percentage does not lower.Supported Versions|  Host Type         |  Toolchain    |  Status|  :---------------  |  :----------  |  :--------------------  ||  [Windows-Latest]  |  Python 3.9   |  [![ci]][_ci]           ||  [Windows-Latest]  |  Python 3.10  |  [![ci]][_ci]           ||  [Windows-Latest]  |  Python 3.11  |  [![ci]][_ci]           ||  [Ubuntu-Latest]   |  Python 3.9   |  [![ci]][_ci]           ||  [Ubuntu-Latest]   |  Python 3.10  |  [![ci]][_ci]           ||  [Ubuntu-Latest]   |  Python 3.11  |  [![ci]][_ci]           ||  [MacOS-Latest]    |  Python 3.9   |  [![coming_soon]][_ci]  ||  [MacOS-Latest]    |  Python 3.10  |  [![coming_soon]][_ci]  ||  [MacOS-Latest]    |  Python 3.11  |  [![coming_soon]][_ci]  |### Current Release[![pypi]][_pypi]All release information is now tracked with Github [tags](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-library/tags), [releases](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-library/releases) and [milestones](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-library/milestones).## ContentThe package contains classes and modules that can be used as the building blocksof tools that are relevant to UEFI firmware developers.  These modules shouldattempt to provide generic support and avoid tightly coupling with specific usecases.  It is expected these modules do not provide direct interaction with theuser (through command line interfaces) but instead are intended to be wrapped inother scripts/tools which contains the specific usage and interface.Examples:* File parsers for edk2 specific file types.  These parse the file and provide  an object for interacting with the content.* UEFI specific services for encoding/decoding binary structures.* UEFI defined values and interfaces for usage in python* Python wrappers for other system cli tools ( signtool, catalog file  generation, inf file generation, etc)* Python utilities to provide consistent logging, command invocation, path  resolution, etc## LicenseAll content in this repository is licensed under [BSD-2-Clause Plus PatentLicense](license.txt).[![PyPI -License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/edk2_pytool_library.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/edk2-pytool-library/)## UsageNOTE: It is strongly recommended that you use python virtual environments.Virtual environments avoid changing the global python workspace and causingconflicting dependencies.  Virtual environments are lightweight and easy to use.[Learn more](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)* To install run `pip install --upgrade edk2-pytool-library`* To use in your python code    ```python    from edk2toollib.&lt;module&gt; import &lt;class&gt;    ```## HistoryThis library and functionality was ported from Project Mu. For history anddocumentation prior to this see the original Project Mu project&lt;https://github.com/microsoft/mu_pip_python_library&gt;## Contribution ProcessThis project welcomes all types of contributions. For issues, bugs, andquestions it is best to open a [githubissue](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-library/issues).### Code ContributionsFor code contributions this project leverages github pull requests.  See githubtutorials, help, and documentation for complete descriptions. For best successplease follow the below process.1. Contributor opens an issue describing problem or new desired functionality2. Contributor forks repository in github3. Contributor creates branch for work in their fork4. Contributor makes code changes, writes relevant unit tests, authors   documentation and release notes as necessary.5. Contributor runs tests locally6. Contributor submits PR to master branch of tianocore/edk2-pytool-library    1. PR reviewers will provide feedback on change.  If any modifications are       required, contributor will make changes and push updates.    2. PR automation will run and validate tests pass    3. If all comments resolved, maintainers approved, and tests pass the PR       will be squash merged and closed by the maintainers.## MaintainersSee the [githubteam](https://github.com/orgs/tianocore/teams/edk-ii-tool-maintainers) for moredetails.## Documentation[![docs]][_docs]### Users and ConsumersDocumentation for the most recent release of edk2-pytool-library is hosted on[tianocore.org/edk2-pytool-library](https://www.tianocore.org/edk2-pytool-library/).Raw documentation is located in the ```docs/``` folder and is split into twoseparate categories. The first is located at ```docs/user/``` and isdocumentation and API references for those that are using this package in theirown project. Users can generate a local copy of the documentation by executing thefollowing command from the root of the project:```cmdpip install --upgrade -e .[docs]mkdocs serve```### ContributorsContributor documentation is located at ```docs/contributor/``` and contains instructions for:* Setting up a development and testing environment* How edk2pytools is versioned and published* Contributing to the edk2-pytool-extensions repository[codecov]: https://codecov.io/gh/tianocore/edk2-pytool-library/branch/master/graph/badge.svg[_codecov]: https://codecov.io/gh/tianocore/edk2-pytool-extensions/[pypi]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/edk2_pytool_library.svg[_pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/edk2-pytool-library/[ci]: https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-library/actions/workflows/run-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master[_ci]: https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-pytool-library/actions/workflows/run-ci.yml[Windows-Latest]: https://github.com/actions/runner-images[Ubuntu-Latest]: https://github.com/actions/runner-images[MacOS-Latest]: https://github.com/actions/runner-images[docs]: https://img.shields.io/website?label=docs&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tianocore.org%2Fedk2-pytool-library%2F[_docs]: https://www.tianocore.org/edk2-pytool-library/[coming_soon]: https://img.shields.io/badge/CI-coming_soon-blue</longdescription>
