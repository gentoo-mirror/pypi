however it is not recommended for production.You should get your own service ID from the webside below and supply it to the client whenever needed.More information about the Census API is available on the official Census documentation [here](http://census.daybreakgames.com/).[Iridar's blog](https://iridar-mirror.knyazev.io/index.html%3Fp=4127.html) is also recommended to understandthe quirks of this particular API as this knowledge is necessary to use *ps2-census* properly.## Installation```shpip install ps2-census```## Full examplesBefore diving in the details of the *ps2-census* client, full examples are available in the `examples` folder.They currently include:- `all_about_trac_5.py` (and the output in `all_about_trac_5.json`): building and executing a query thatfetches pretty much everything that's to know about the TR TRAC-5 carbine- `character_death_event_stream.py` (and the output in `caracter_death_event_stream.ndjson`): subscribing toall character death events on the SolTech server, receive at most 20 events and print them, then gracefulydisconnect## Query buildingQueries are made on collections with optional joins on other collections as well as variouscommands that alter the output.A Census API collection is analog to a relation in a generic relational database system, and aCensus API join is analog to a join between these relations.### Basic queryTo build a query, instantiate the `Query` class with a `Collection` (and your service ID,though it will be omitted in next examples for conciseness):```pythonfrom ps2_census import Collection, Queryquery: Query = Query(Collection.ITEM, service_id=YOUR_SERVICE_ID)```Chain methods to alter the query further:```pythonquery: Query = (    Query(Collection.ITEM)    .lang(&quot;en&quot;)    .sort((&quot;item_id&quot;, 1), (&quot;faction_id&quot;, -1))    .limit(30)    [...])```Available methods are:- `filter(field: str, value: Union[str, int], modifier: Optional[SearchModifier])`: filterthe query on a field; `ps2_census.SearchModifier` contains all the modifiers made availableby the Census API (`SearchModifier.CONTAINS`, `SearchModifier.LESS_OR_EQUAL`, ...)- `show(*args: str)`: only return the provided fields in results- `hide(*args: str)`: do not return the provided fields in results- `sort(*args: Tuple[str, Literal[1, -1]])`: sort the results by field, either in increasing or decreasing order- `has(*args: str)`: only return results which have the specified fields- `case(arg: bool)`: whether `filter()`s are case sensive or not; default to `True`- `limit(arg: int)`: limit the return to *at most* `arg` results; required in tendem with `start()` for queries having too large of a result and therefore fail; defaults to `1`- `limit_per_db(arg: int)`: limit the return to *at most* `arg * databases count` results; useful whenquerying the `Collection.CHARACTER` collection whose objects are randomly distributed among multipledatabases in order to have more predictable results- `start(arg: int)`: start with the `arg`th object within the results of the query- `include_null(arg: bool)`: whether to include keys with `None` values in results; defaults to `False`- `lang(arg: str)`: only keep the supplied language for internationalized strings- `join(arg: Join)`: perform a collection join; see the following documentation for additional details- `tree(arg: Tree)`: rearrange lists of data into trees; see the following documentation for additional details- `timing(arg: bool)`: show query timing information- `exact_match_first(arg: bool)`: when using `filter()`s with `SearchModifier`s, put exact matches at the top of theresults list disregarding `sort()`s- `distinct(arg: str)`: get the distinct values for a certain field- `retry(arg: bool)`: retry queries at most one time before failing; defaults to `True`Execute the query in one of the 2 ways made available by the Census API:- `.count()` to get the items count```pythonquery.count()&gt; {'count': 21048}```- `.get()` to get the results```pythonquery.get()&gt; {'item_list': [{...}, {...}, ...], 'returned': 30}````count()` and `get()` calls are when the query is actually sent to the Census API endpoint.They will raise status exceptions if appropriate.### Simple joinIn order to perform joins instantiate the `Join` class with a `Collection`, add any additionalchained methods to it, and pass it to the `Query` object via `query.join()`:```pythonfrom ps2_census import Collection, Join, Queryquery: Query = (    Query(Collection.ITEM)    .join(        Join(Collection.WEAPON_DATASHEET)        .outer(0)        .on(&quot;item_id&quot;)        .to(&quot;item_id&quot;)        .inject_at(&quot;weapon_datasheet&quot;)        [...]    ))```Available `Join` methods are:- `nest(other: Join)`: nest another join within this one; see the following documentation for additional details- `on(arg: str)`: specify the field on this collection (the `Query` or parent `Join`) to join on; if not provided will default to this collection's ID (`{this_type}_id`)- `to(arg: str)`: specify the field on the other collection (the `Join`'s) to join to; if not provided will default to the `on` value- `list(arg: Literal[0, 1])`: whether the joined data is a list (and therefore will result in a list of objects) or not; `1` if it is a list, `0` if not; default to `0`- `show(*args: str)`: only keep the provided fields in results- `hide(*args: str)`: do not keep the provided fields in results- `inject_at(arg: str)`: the field name where the joined data will be injected in the parent element (`Query` result item or parent `Join` element)- `terms(*args: Tuple[str, Union[str, int]])`: filter the join result by conditions (eg. `terms((&quot;faction_id&quot;, 1), (&quot;skill_set_id&quot;, 129))`)- `outer(arg: Literam[0, 1])`: whether the join will perform an outer join (include non-matches) of an inner join (exclude non-matches); `1` for outer, `0` for inner; defaults to `1`Multiple joins can be performed one after another on the same `Query` and the trees will be merged inthe result:```pythonquery: Query = (    Query(Collection.ITEM)    .join(        Join(Collection.WEAPON_DATASHEET)    )    .join(        Join(Collection.ITEM_TO_WEAPON)    ))```### Nesting joins`Join`s can be nested one into another both deeply and lateraly. Nesting is done by reference: each `Join` instancecontains a list of references to its nested `Join`s.*Note*: be careful about modifying the `Join` instances after their creation if you assign them to localsfor convenience, as shown in the following examples.As nesting is done by reference and the whole structure is &quot;compiled&quot; (into a querystring) on the callto `query.join()`, if any modification is done to an instance between its creation and the resolution,it will indirectly impact the result of any other parent and/or nested `Join`.Make use of the below described factories to make clean copies of your instances as necessary.#### Deeply nested joinDeeply nested join are necessary in order to access data structures deeper in the collections tree.To deeply nest joins, instantiate the `Join` class multiple times and combine them through`join1.nest(join2.nest(join3))` where `join3` is nested within `join2` and `join2` is nested within `join1`:```pythonfrom ps2_census import Collection, Join, Queryitem_to_weapon_join: Join = (    Join(Collection.ITEM_TO_WEAPON)    .on(&quot;item_id&quot;)    .to(&quot;item_id&quot;)    .inject_at(&quot;item_to_weapon&quot;))weapon_join: Join = (    Join(Collection.WEAPON)    .on(&quot;weapon_id&quot;)    .to(&quot;weapon_id&quot;)    .inject_at(&quot;weapon&quot;))weapon_to_fire_group_join: Join = (    Join(Collection.WEAPON_TO_FIRE_GROUP)    .on(&quot;weapon_id&quot;)    .to(&quot;weapon_id&quot;)    .inject_at(&quot;weapon_to_fire_group&quot;))query: Query = (    Query(Collection.ITEM)    .filter(&quot;item_type_id&quot;, ItemType.WEAPON)    .join(        item_to_weapon_join.nest(            weapon_join.nest(                weapon_to_fire_group_join            )        )    ))```#### Lateraly nested joinsLateraly nested joins are necessary in order to access data structures at the same depth in the collections tree.To laterally nest joins, instantiate the `Join` class multiple times and combine them through`join1.nest(join2).nest(join3)` where `join2` and `join3` are nested within `join1`:```pythonfrom ps2_census import Collection, Join, Queryfire_group_to_fire_mode_join: Join = (    Join(Collection.FIRE_GROUP_TO_FIRE_MODE)    .outer(0)    .on(&quot;fire_group_id&quot;)    .to(&quot;fire_group_id&quot;)    .list(1)    .inject_at(&quot;fire_group_to_fire_modes&quot;))fire_mode_join: Join = (    Join(Collection.FIRE_MODE_2)    .outer(0)    .on(&quot;fire_mode_id&quot;)    .to(&quot;fire_mode_id&quot;)    .inject_at(&quot;fire_mode&quot;))fire_mode_to_projectile_join: Join = (    Join(Collection.FIRE_MODE_TO_PROJECTILE)    .outer(0)    .on(&quot;fire_mode_id&quot;)    .to(&quot;fire_mode_id&quot;)    .inject_at(&quot;fire_mode_to_projectile&quot;))player_state_group_join: Join = (    Join(Collection.PLAYER_STATE_GROUP_2)    .outer(0)    .on(&quot;player_state_group_id&quot;)    .to(&quot;player_state_group_id&quot;)    .list(1)    .inject_at(&quot;player_state_groups&quot;))query: Query = (    Query(Collection.WEAPON_TO_FIRE_GROUP)    .join(        fire_group_to_fire_mode_join        .nest(            fire_mode_join            .nest(fire_mode_to_projectile_join)            .nest(player_state_group_join)        )    ))```### TreeTrees are also built using their own class, `Tree`, then passed to the `Query` object:```pythonfrom ps2_census import Collection, Query, Treequery: Query = (    Query(Collection.ITEM)    .tree(        Tree(&quot;name.en&quot;)        .prefix(&quot;en_name_&quot;)        [...]    ))```This will return a dictionary of items with their english name prefixed by `en_name_` as keysand the objects themselves as values, instead of a flat list of items.Available methods are:- `list(arg: Literal[0, 1])`: `0` if tree data is not a list, `1` if it is a list; defaults to `0`- `prefix(arg: str)`: prefix to add to the field value- `start(arg: str)`: where the tree starts; defaults to the root (root list objects will be formatted as a tree)## FactoriesIn order to ease the project-wide definition of `Query`, `Join` and `Tree` objects,each of these classes has a `get_factory()` method.Upon invocation it saves a copy of the current object and returns a callable that, upon each invocation,returns a fresh copy of that saved state.```pythonquery: Query = Query(Collection.ABILITY).has(&quot;someField&quot;).case(False)query_factory: Callable[[], Query] = query.get_factory()query_copy: Query = query_factory()assert query == query_copy&gt; Truequery = query.timing(True)assert query != query_copy&gt; Truequery_copy = query_copy.lang(&quot;en&quot;)another_copy = query_factory()assert query == another_copy&gt; Trueassert query_copy != another_copy&gt; True```Factories obtained in this way are useful to define `Query`, `Join` or `Tree`s somewhere in your code and storetheir factory callables, with the guarantee that you cannot modify the shared definition anywhere.*my_module.py*```pythonfrom ps2_census import Query, Collectionmy_query_factory: Callable[[], Query] = (    Query(Collection.ABILITY)    .lang(&quot;en&quot;)    .get_factory())```*main.py*```pythonfrom my_module import my_query_factoryquery: Query = my_query_factory()query.start(100)  # does not modify any shared object```## Common enumsCensus API data uses a lot of integer enumerations that are collections themselves.For example the `faction_id` key in items from `Collection.ITEM` is an integer that representsa specific fation, refering to `Collection.FACTION`: Vanu is `1`, NC is `2` etc.In order to reduce the amount of necessary joins, which are arguably the most complex part of Census queries,some common enumerations are provided in `ps2_census.enums` as Python enum.IntEnum classes, including:- ArmorFacing- FacilityType- Faction- FireModeType- ItemType- ItemCategory- MetagameEventState- PlayerState- ProjectileFlightType- ResistType- ResourceType- RewardType- TargetType- Vehicle- WorldThese typically do not change often and *ps2-census* will be updated whenever there is such a change.They can be used just for reference, but also in queries for filtering.See the following example for filtering weapon items only using `ps2_census.enums.ItemType`:```pythonfrom ps2_census.enums import ItemTypequery = (    Query(Collection.ITEM)    .filter(&quot;item_type_id&quot;, ItemType.WEAPON))```## Event Stream*ps2-census* offers a client that handles connection to the WebSocket endpoint, subscriptionto various streams and reception of the events.*Note*: because the client uses the [websockets](https://github.com/aaugustin/websockets) library,we need to handle async calls.### UsageFirst you need to connect to the WebSocket endpoint; to do this, instantiate the `EventStream` class:```pythonfrom ps2_census import EventStreamstream: EventStream = await EventStream(service_id=YOUR_SERVICE_ID)```Then, subscribe to events:```pythonfrom ps2_census import CharacterEvent, WorldEvent, EventStreamWorld, GenericCharacterawait stream.subscribe(    worlds=[EventStreamWorld.SOLTECH, EventStreamWorld.BRIGGS],    events=[CharacterEvent.DEATH, WorldEvent.CONTINENT_LOCK],    characters=[GenericCharacter.ALL, &quot;1234&quot;, &quot;5678&quot;],    logical_and_characters_with_worlds=True)```Where:- `worlds` is a list of `EventStreamWorld` objects. Use `[EventStreamWorld.ALL]` for all worlds- `events` is a list of `CharacterEvent`, `WorldEvent` or `GenericEvent` objects. Use `GenericEvent.ALL` to get all events (character and world)- `characters` is a list of character IDs as strings or the special `GenericCharacter.ALL` to subscribe to all characters- `logical_and_characters_with_worlds` is True if you want to match all events concerning the characters *AND* the worlds; default is False, so it matches all events concerning the characters *OR* the worldsYou can perform multiple subscriptions one after another on the same `EventStream` object; they are additively merged.Finally, you need to handle received events from your subscription:```pythonawait stream.receive()```This simple example put together (you might want to develop it further to do more than simply print events,handle graceful deconnection, etc):```pythonimport asynciofrom ps2_census import CharacterEvent, WorldEvent, EventStream, EventStreamWorld, GenericCharacterasync def main():    stream: EventStream = await EventStream()    await stream.subscribe(        worlds=[EventStreamWorld.SOLTECH, EventStreamWorld.BRIGGS],        events=[CharacterEvent.DEATH, WorldEvent.CONTINENT_LOCK],        characters=[GenericCharacter.ALL, &quot;1234&quot;, &quot;5678&quot;],        logical_and_characters_with_worlds=True    )    while True:        print(await stream.receive())asyncio.run(main())```More information about the Planetside2 Census event stream can be found at [here](http://census.daybreakgames.com/#what-is-websocket).## Next steps- Improve the `EventStream` client to make it slightly higher-level (handle disconnections,filter events, etc)## Similar projects- *leonhard-s*' [auraxium](https://github.com/leonhard-s/auraxium)## Development### EnvironmentIn order to develop *ps2-census*:- Setup a virtual environment with python 3.8- Install [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)- Install dependencies with `poetry install`- Run tests with `pytest`- Update dependencies with `poetry update`### Technical detailsAll interaction with the Census API (except the WebSocket events stream part) is done throughquery parameters. Query bodies are always empty and all information is carried in the query URL string.*ps2-census*' objective is to wrap the building of these (often very long and complex)querystrings and provide a comfortable, structured programmatic interface.To achieve that, we make use of the `Query` class which:- on initialization sets up basic query elements such as endpoint, service ID, collection and namespace,- at each &quot;command&quot; method call adds query parameters to its `parameters` dictionary attribute,- at `get()` or `count()` build the actual URL and execute the query using the `requests` library.Collection joins are more complicated as they are not built as proper query parameters;inside the final query, each call to `query.join()` creates a new query parameter, eg.`...&amp;c:join={join_string}&amp;...` with the `join_string` being written in a specific format.Hence the `Join` class which:- on initialization sets up the collection,- at each method call adds items to its `items` dictionary attribute,- at each `nest()` call stores a reference to the nested `Join` instance in its `nested_joins` list attribute,- at `__str__()` builds the `join_string` that will become a main query's parameter value, in the specific formatand using the `items` elements as well as recursively calling `__str__()` on `nested_joins` items.Therefore, the `join_string` is not actually computed before a call to a `Join` instance's `__str__()` method,and it is recursively computed across nested joins.The event streams part is more conventional, as *ps2-census* just needs to connect to a WebSocket endpoint, issuesubscription commands in a custom but simple format and then read messages from the stream.</longdescription>
