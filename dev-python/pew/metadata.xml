	<longdescription>Python Env Wrapper is a set of commands to manage multiple [virtual environments](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv). Pew can create, delete and copy your environments, using a single command to switch to them wherever you are, while keeping them in a single (configurable) location.Virtualenvs makes it easier to work on more than one project at a time without introducing conflicts in their dependencies.Pew is completely shell-agnostic and thus works on bash, zsh, fish, powershell, etc.For the documentation, you might want to read here:https://github.com/berdario/pew#usage</longdescription>
