	<longdescription># A Deep Learning ToolKitThis project is WIP.[Read the Docs](https://dlk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)## Install```pip install dlkor git clone this repo and dopython setup.py install```## What's this?* Provide a templete for deep learning (especially for nlp) training and deploy.* Provide parameters search.* Provide basic architecture search.* Provide some basic modules and models.* Provide reuse the pretrained model for predict.## More Feature is Comming* [ ] Tasks support    * [ ] NLP        * [X] Classification         * [X] Pair Classification         * [X] Regression         * [X] Pair Regression         * [X] Sequence Labeling        * [X] Span Classification        * [X] Relation Extraction        * [X] Token Rerank        * [ ] MRC SQuAD        * [ ] Translation        * [ ] Summary    * [ ] CV        * [ ] Classification - [ ] Generate models.- [ ] Distill structure.- [ ] Ensemble models for NLU(and check how to do this in NLG)- [ ] Training Strategy    - [X] Adversarial Training(FGM/PGD/FreeLB)    - [X] Schedule Loss(you can control the loss schedule)    - [X] Schedule MultiTask Loss(you can control the loss schedule for each task)    - [X] Focal Loss- [ ] Online service by triton.- [ ] Data Augment.- [ ] ~~Support LightGBM. Will split to another package.~~* [ ] Make most complexity modules like Beam Search, CRF to be scriptable.* [X] Add UnitTest    * [X] Parser    * [X] Tokenizer    * [X] Config    * [X] Link</longdescription>
