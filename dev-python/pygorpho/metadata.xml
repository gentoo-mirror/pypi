	<longdescription># pygorphoPython bindings for [gorpho](https://github.com/patmjen/gorpho).This is a Python library for fast 3D mathematical morphology using CUDA. Currently, the library provides:* Dilation and erosion for grayscale 3D images.* Support for flat or grayscale structuring elements.* A van Herk/Gil-Werman implementation for fast dilation/erosion with flat line segments in 3D.* Automatic block processing for 3D images which can't fit in GPU memory.**Documentation** can be found on [https://pygorpho.readthedocs.io](https://pygorpho.readthedocs.io)## InstallationFirst, make sure you have [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) 9.2 or later installed. Then, install with pip:```pip install pygorpho```## Installing from sourceAgain, make sure you have [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) 9.2 or later installed. Also, you need a compatible C++ compiler, which supports C++14. Then, following these instructions should allow you to build and install the package:1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/patmjen/pygorpho.git`2. Change directory: `cd pygorpho`3. Install the required Python packages: `pip install numpy scikit-build cmake ninja`4. Build and install: `python setup.py install`That should be it! To test, run `python`, and try to `import pygorpho as pg`.</longdescription>
