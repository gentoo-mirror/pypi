The components have all beendesigned to provide functionality similar to Dash's core [`Loading` component](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components/loading),and will display a loading spinner whilst the underlying children are re-rendering.The spinners in it have been adapted for use from a number of other existinglibraries:- [react-spinners](https://github.com/davidhu2000/react-spinners)- [react-loader-spinner](https://github.com/mhnpd/react-loader-spinner)- [react-css-spinners](https://github.com/alex996/react-css-spinners)The majority of spinner names have been retained from the originals, but some have been amended where there were name clashes.More details on the components and usage can be found in our [documentation](https://dash-loading-spinners.sproodlebuzz.co.uk/).---## InstallationDash Loading Spinners is available through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dash-loading-spinners/), and can be installed with pip:```bashpip install dash-loading-spinners```---## Basic UsageOnce installed, you can make use of the components (in their most basic sense) as follows:```pythonimport dashimport dash_loading_spinners as dlsapp = dash.Dash()app.layout = dls.Hash()if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    app.run_server()```There are a number of attributes which are common across all spinners. These are:- **`id`** (*string*; optional):    The ID of this component, used to identify dash components in    callbacks. The ID needs to be unique across all of the components    in an app. - **`children`** (*a list of or a singular dash component, string or number*; optional):    The children of this component.- **`show_initially`** (*boolean*; default `True`):    Whether the Spinner should show on app start-up before the loading    state has been determined. Default True.- **`debounce`** (*number*; default `0`):    When using the spinner as a loading spinner, add a time delay (in    ms) to the spinner being removed to prevent flickering.- **`fullscreen`** (*boolean*; optional):    Boolean that determines if the loading spinner will be displayed    full-screen or not.- **`fullscreenClassName`** (*string*; optional):    CSS class names to apply to the container when in fullscreen.- **`fullscreen_style`** (*dict*; optional):    Defines CSS styles for the container when in fullscreen.Many spinners additional have properties that can be customised, including colour and size. You can find these on the individual [component](https://dash-loading-spinners.sproodlebuzz.co.uk/examples) pages. Realistically, as part of an application, you will be using them alongside other components and callbacks. Here is an example of what this might look like:_Note: [`dash-bootstrap-components`](https://github.com/facultyai/dash-bootstrap-components) isn't necessary for `dash-loading-spinners` to work, but has been includedto improve the layout._```python# app.pyimport dashimport dash_bootstrap_components as dbcimport dash_loading_spinners as dlsfrom dash import dcc, html, Input, Outputfrom helpers import get_new_graphapp = dash.Dash(external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.UNITED])app.layout = html.Div(    [        dbc.Row(            [                dbc.Col(                    html.Div(                        dbc.Button(                            &quot;Simulate slow loading component&quot;,                            id=&quot;loading-button&quot;,                            className=&quot;btn-success&quot;,                            n_clicks=0,                        )                    ),                    md=3,                ),                dbc.Col(                    dls.Hash(                        dcc.Graph(id=&quot;loading-output&quot;,),                        color=&quot;#435278&quot;,                        speed_multiplier=2,                        size=100,                    ),                    md=9,                ),            ],        ),    ])@app.callback(    Output(&quot;loading-output&quot;, &quot;figure&quot;), [Input(&quot;loading-button&quot;, &quot;n_clicks&quot;)],)def load_output(n):    # See note below    return get_new_graph(n)if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    app.run_server()```The function `get_new_graph` in this example is deliberately ambiguous, as it simply acts as a placeholder for any slow-loading component. For completeness, if you wish to use a similar example to the one shown above, you can use the following function:```python# helpers.pyimport numpy as npimport plotly.graph_objects as goimport timedef get_new_graph(n):    if n:        # Simulate slow-loading component        time.sleep(2)    # Generate a random scatter plot    n = (n + 1) * 10    return go.Figure(        data=go.Scatter(            y=np.random.randn(n) * 100,            mode=&quot;markers&quot;,            marker=dict(                size=16,                color=np.random.randn(n) * 100,                colorscale=&quot;blues&quot;,                showscale=True,            ),        ),        layout=go.Layout(title=&quot;This graph takes ages to re-load&quot;),    )```</longdescription>
