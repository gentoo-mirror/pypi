	<longdescription># DJITelloPy## [中文文档 (Chinese version of this readme)](README_CN.md)DJI Tello drone python interface using the official [Tello SDK](https://dl-cdn.ryzerobotics.com/downloads/tello/20180910/Tello%20SDK%20Documentation%20EN_1.3.pdf) and [Tello EDU SDK](https://dl-cdn.ryzerobotics.com/downloads/Tello/Tello%20SDK%202.0%20User%20Guide.pdf). This library has the following features:- implementation of all tello commands- easily retrieve a video stream- receive and parse state packets- control a swarm of drones- support for python &gt;= 3.6Feel free to contribute!## Install using pip```pip install djitellopy```For Linux distributions with both python2 and python3 (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, ...) you need to run```pip3 install djitellopy```## Install in developer modeUsing the commands below you can install the repository in an _editable_ way. This allows you to modify the library and use the modified version as if you had installed it regularly.```git clone https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy.gitcd DJITelloPypip install -e .```## Usage### API ReferenceSee [djitellopy.readthedocs.io](https://djitellopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a full reference of all classes and methods available.### Simple example```pythonfrom djitellopy import Tellotello = Tello()tello.connect()tello.takeoff()tello.move_left(100)tello.rotate_counter_clockwise(90)tello.move_forward(100)tello.land()```### More examplesIn the [examples](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/tree/master/examples/) directory there are some code examples.Comments in the examples are mostly in both english and chinese.- [taking a picture](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/tree/master/examples/take-picture.py)- [recording a video](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/tree/master/examples/record-video.py)- [flying a swarm (multiple Tellos at once)](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/tree/master/examples/simple-swarm.py)- [simple controlling using your keyboard](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/tree/master/examples/manual-control-opencv.py)- [mission pad detection](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/tree/master/examples/mission-pads.py)- [fully featured manual control using pygame](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/tree/master/examples/manual-control-pygame.py)### Notes- If you are using the `streamon` command and the response is `Unknown command` means you have to update the Tello firmware. That can be done through the Tello app.- Mission pad detection and navigation is only supported by the Tello EDU.- Bright environment is necessary for successful use of mission pads.- Connecting to an existing wifi network is only supported by the Tello EDU.- When connected to an existing wifi network video streaming is not available (TODO: needs confirmation with the new SDK3 `port` commands)## DJITelloPy in the media and in the wild- \&gt;1.5 Million views Youtube: [Drone Programming With Python Course](https://youtu.be/LmEcyQnfpDA?t=1282)- German magazine &quot;Make&quot;: [&quot;KI steuert Follow-Me-Drohne&quot; (paywall)](https://www.heise.de/select/make/2021/6/2116016361503211330), [authors notes](https://www.jentsch.io/ki-artikel-im-aktuellen-make-magazin-6-21/), [github repo](https://github.com/msoftware/tello-tracking)- Webinar on learn.droneblocks.io: [&quot;DJITelloPy Drone Coding&quot;](https://learn.droneblocks.io/p/djitellopy), [github repo](https://learn.droneblocks.io/p/djitellopy)- Universities &amp; Schools using DJITelloPy in projects or in class:    - [Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana](https://www.bsu.edu/)    - [Technical University Kaiserslautern](https://www.uni-kl.de/)    - [Sha Tin College, Hong Kong](https://shatincollege.edu.hk/)    - [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/)    - [add yours...](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/edit/master/README.md)## Authors* **Damià Fuentes Escoté*** **Jakob Löw*** [and more](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/graphs/contributors)## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) file for details</longdescription>
