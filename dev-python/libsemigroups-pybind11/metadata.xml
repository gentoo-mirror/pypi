	<longdescription># libsemigroups_pybind11 - Version 0.10.1## python bindings for the C++ library libsemigroups[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/299898305.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/299898305)### What is `libsemigroups`?`libsemigroups` is a C++14 library containing implementations of severalalgorithms for computing finite and finitely presented semigroups.Namely:-   the [Froidure-Pin algorithm](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Rio.pdf)    for computing finite semigroups-   the [Todd-Coxeter    algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd%E2%80%93Coxeter_algorithm)    for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;-   the [Knuth-Bendix    algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Bendix_completion_algorithm)    for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;-   the [Schreier-Sims    algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schreier%E2%80%93Sims_algorithm)    for permutation groups;-   a preliminary implementation of the    [Konieczny](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02573672)    and    [Lallement-McFadden](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717108800570)    algorithm for computing finite semigroups which act on sets.`libsemigroups_pybind11` is a python package exposing much (but not all)of the functionality of `libsemigroups`.The development version of `libsemigroups_pybind11` is available on[github](https://github.com/libsemigroups/libsemigroups_pybind11), andsome related projects are [here](https://github.com/libsemigroups).# Installation## Installing with pipIt's possible to install `libsemigroups_pybind11` using `pip` via one of:    pip install libsemigroups_pybind11    pip3 install libsemigroups_pybind11    python -m pip install libsemigroups_pybind11    python3 -m pip install libsemigroups_pybind11## Installing with condaThis installation method assumes that you have anaconda or minicondainstalled. See the [getting started](http://bit.ly/33B0Vfs) and[miniconda download page](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) on the[conda](https://conda.io/) website.It might be a good idea to create and activate a conda environment tocontain the installation of the `libsemigroups_pybind11`:    conda create --name libsemigroups    conda activate libsemigroupsInstall `libsemigroups_pybind11`:    conda install -c conda-forge libsemigroups_pybind11At present this does not work for Macs with M1 processors.## From the sourcesBefore installing `libsemigroups_pybind11` from its sources you shouldfirst perform a system install of the C++ library `libsemigroups`. Forinformation about how to install `libsemigroups` see [the installationguide](https://libsemigroups.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).Assuming that you have `libsemigroups` installed you can install`libsemigroups_pybind11` as follows:    git clone https://github.com/libsemigroups/libsemigroups_pybind11    cd libsemigroups_pybind11    pip install .### From a release archiveTo build `libsemigroups_pybind11` from a release archive:    curl -L -O https://github.com/libsemigroups/libsemigroups_pybind11/releases/latest/download/libsemigroups_pybind11-0.10.1.tar.gz    tar -xf libsemigroups_pybind11-0.10.1.tar.gz    rm -f libsemigroups_pybind11-0.10.1.tar.gz    cd libsemigroups_pybind11-0.10.1    pip install .## Building the documentationThe following are required to be able to build the documentation:1.  `python3`2.  the python packages:    `jinja2 sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme sphinxcontrib-bibtex sphinx_copybutton`Assuming you already have `python3` install, on Mac OSX you can installall of the above by doing:    python3 -m pip3 install -r requirements.txtThen it ought to be possible to just run `make doc` in the`libsemigroups_pybind11` directory.## IssuesIf you find any problems with `libsemigroups_pybind11`, or have anysuggestions for features that you'd like to see, please use the [issuetracker](https://github.com/libsemigroups/libsemigroups_pybind11/issues).</longdescription>
