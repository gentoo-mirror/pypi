At present it supports APIs to detect and modelcompatibility relationships among different CPU microarchitectures.## Getting started with developmentThe `archspec` Python package needs [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) tobe installed from VCS sources. The preferred method to install it is viaits custom installer outside of any virtual environment:```consolecurl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -```You can refer to [Poetry's documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)for further details or for other methods to install this tool. You'll also need `tox`to run unit test:```consolepip install --user tox```Finally, you'll need to clone the repository:```consolegit clone --recursive https://github.com/archspec/archspec.git```### Running unit testsOnce you have your environment ready you can run `archspec` unit testsusing ``tox`` from the root of the repository:```console$ tox  [ ... ]  py27: commands succeeded  py35: commands succeeded  py36: commands succeeded  py37: commands succeeded  py38: commands succeeded  pylint: commands succeeded  flake8: commands succeeded  black: commands succeeded  congratulations :)```## Citing ArchspecIf you are referencing `archspec` in a publication, please cite the followingpaper:* Massimiliano Culpo, Gregory Becker, Carlos Eduardo Arango Gutierrez, Kenneth   Hoste, and Todd Gamblin.
