	<longdescription>Spylls: Hunspell ported to Python=================================**Spylls** is an effort of porting prominent spellcheckers into clear, well-structured, well-documented Python. It is intended to be useful both as a library and as some kind of &quot;reference (or investigatory, if you will) implementation&quot;. Currently, only `Hunspell &lt;https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell&gt;`_ is ported.Hunspell is a long-living, complicated, almost undocumented piece of software, and it was our feeling that the significant part of human knowledge is somehow &quot;locked&quot; in a form of a large C++ project. That's how **Spylls** was born: as an attempt to &quot;unlock&quot; it, via well-structured and well-documented implementation in a high-level language.**Follow the explanatory blog post series:** `on my blog &lt;https://zverok.github.io/spellchecker.html&gt;`_, `on Medium &lt;https://medium.com/spylls-rebuilding-the-spellchecker&gt;`_, or `subscribe to my mailing list &lt;https://zverok.github.io/subscribe.html&gt;`_.Usage as a library------------------::  $ pip install spylls.. code-block:: python  from spylls.hunspell import Dictionary  # en_US dictionary is distributed with spylls  # See docs to load other dictionaries  dictionary = Dictionary.from_files('en_US')  print(dictionary.lookup('spylls'))  # False  for suggestion in dictionary.suggest('spylls'):      print(suggestion)  # spells  # spillsDocumentation-------------Full documentation, including detailed source code/algorithms walkthrough, more detailed reasoning and some completeness reports, is available at https://spylls.readthedocs.io/.Project Links-------------- Docs: https://spylls.readthedocs.io/- GitHub: https://github.com/zverok/spylls- PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/spylls- Issues: https://github.com/spylls/spylls/issuesLicense-------MPL 2.0. See the bundled `LICENSE &lt;https://github.com/spylls/spylls/blob/master/LICENSE&gt;`_ file for more details.Note that being an &quot;explanatory rewrite&quot;, spylls should considered a derivative work of Hunspell, and so would be all of its ports/rewrites.We are incredibly grateful to Hunspell's original authors and current maintainers for all the hard work they've put into the most used spellchecker in the world!</longdescription>
