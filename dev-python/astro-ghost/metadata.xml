The search will continue. Theurge is older than history. It is not satisfied and it will not be oppressed.&quot;--Edwin HubbleWelcome to GHOST, the database for supernovae and their host galaxies. Thisdatabase contains ~16k sources in PS1, which were used to predict supernovaclasses in Gagliano et al. (2020). Installation instructions for the analysistools are below.Installation------------For details on installing and using GHOST, see the`documentation &lt;https://uiucsnastro-ghost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_.Citation------------If you use this code, please cite the associated paper with the bibtex entry below::   @ARTICLE{2021ApJ...908..170G,       author = {{Gagliano}, Alex and {Narayan}, Gautham and {Engel}, Andrew and {Carrasco Kind}, Matias and {LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration}},       title = &quot;{GHOST: Using Only Host Galaxy Information to Accurately Associate and Distinguish Supernovae}&quot;,       journal = {\apj},       year = 2021,       month = feb,       volume = {908},       number = {2},       eid = {170},       pages = {170},       doi = {10.3847/1538-4357/abd02b},       archivePrefix = {arXiv},       eprint = {2008.09630},       primaryClass = {astro-ph.GA},       adsurl = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908..170G},       adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System}    }License-------This project is Copyright (c) Alexander Gagliano and licensed underthe terms of the BSD 3-Clause license.

No, really.There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're notready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly goodenough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code atall, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open sourceprojects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect codeisn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it'strying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from thosemistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.Note: This disclaimer was originally written by`Adrienne Lowe &lt;https://github.com/adriennefriend&gt;`_ for a`PyCon talk &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uj746j9Heo&gt;`_, and was adapted byastro_ghost based on its use in the README file for the`MetPy project &lt;https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy&gt;`_.</longdescription>
