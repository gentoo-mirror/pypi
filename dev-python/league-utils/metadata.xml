	<longdescription>LeagueUtils===========LeagueUtils is a set of utilities for interacting with League of Legends data.Currently, it contains the League ISG (Item Set Generator) and an API for itemgold efficiency.|version| |build| |coverage| |codacy| |landscape| |requirements|ISG---The Item Set Generator is designed to build recommended pages for everychampion in every viable role. It does this by pulling date from Riot's API andfrom some third party sites, determining which build paths work best, andupdating your League config with the results.Usage~~~~~The most common use case is to run::    league-utils-isgto install the item sets for every champion. The item sets will be installedbeside the default Riot recommended pages, but if you have manually downloadeditem sets into your config directory before, these may be overwritten. Makesure any such files have unique names before running this script! (eg. anythingother than :code:`${CHAMPION}_${ROLE}.json`).You can also run something like::    league-utils-isg --champ Rumbleto load info on only one champion.Gold Efficiency---------------The Gold Efficiency project automatically calculates the efficiency of allitems by looking at the vallue of the stats they provide. This is a common formof `theory crafting`_.These stats are calculated in real-time, and thus will always be up-to-datewhen a new patch is released.When using this data, keep in mind that some aspects of items such as uniqueabilities will not be taken into account in determining the worth of an item.The ignored stats or abilities will be returned in the result.Usage~~~~~For now, this is available only as a REST API. You can access the results forany item by ID. For example, to get efficiency data on Overlord's Bloodmail,run::    curl https://league.thekev.in/item/3084/efficiencySetup-----Install from PyPI~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Simply run::    pip3 install league-utilsInstall from Source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~After cloning this repo or downloading and un{zip,tar}ing the `most recentzipfile or tarball`_.::    python3 setup.py installRun without installing~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This project can also be run without installation. After cloning this repo ordownloading and un{zip,tar}ing the `most recent zipfile or tarball`_, run::    pip3 install -r requirements.txtand use the `league-utils.py` script in the root of this folder. Working in a`virtualenv`_ is recommended!Note that when using this method, the sub-project must be provided as anargument. For example:::    league-utils-isg [options]  # becomes: ./league-utils.py isg [options]From a binary~~~~~~~~~~~~~Pre-compiled binaries are provided for some Operating Systems. If yours issupported, you can grab the binary for the `latest release`_ and just run thatwithout installing anything. Note that using this method does not allow you toeasily update your installation.If you use a binary to run :code:`league-utils`, make sure you use the:code:`league-utils.py` syntax described above.Running Your Own Server=======================So you want to run your own API server, eh? Well, there's a convenient dockerfile you can use for that, but it does require just a bit of setup.You'll need to get yourself API keys for both Riot's API and champion.gg's.Once you do, simply export them to your shell and use docker-compose to run theserver. Roughly speaking, you'll want to:::    export CHAMPIONGG_TOKEN=foo-asdfasdfasdf    export LEAGUE_TOKEN=bar-fdsafdsafdsa    git clone git@github.com:thekevjames/league.git    cd league    docker-compose build    docker-compose upYou may also be interested in using the `official docker image`_. If you are,the following might make your life easier:::    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheKevJames/league/master/docker-compose.yml &gt; docker-compose.yml    mkdir -p api  # docker-compose oddity    docker-compose pull    docker-compose up -dDisclaimer==========This project probably won't make your computer explode, make your girlfriendleave you, or get you fired from your job, but I make no guarantees thatblindly following its advice won't drop your ELO.
