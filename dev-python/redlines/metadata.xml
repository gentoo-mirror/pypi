	<longdescription># Redlines![Repository banner image](repository-open-graph.png)`Redlines` produces a Markdown text showing the differences between two strings/text. The changes are represented withstrike-throughs and underlines, which looks similar to Microsoft Word's track changes. This method of showing changes ismore familiar to lawyers and is more compact for long series of characters.Redlines uses [SequenceMatcher](https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html#difflib.SequenceMatcher)to find differences between words used.## ExampleGiven an original string:    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.And the string to be tested with:    The quick brown fox walks past the lazy dog.The library gives a result of:    The quick brown fox &lt;del&gt;jumps over &lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins&gt;walks past &lt;/ins&gt;the lazy dog.Which is rendered like this:&gt; The quick brown fox &lt;del&gt;jumps over &lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins&gt;walks past &lt;/ins&gt;the lazy dog.## Install```shellpip install redlines```## UsageThe library contains one class: `Redlines`, which is used to compare text.```pythonfrom redlines import Redlinestest = Redlines(    &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&quot;,    &quot;The quick brown fox walks past the lazy dog.&quot;,)assert (        test.output_markdown        == &quot;The quick brown fox &lt;del&gt;jumps over &lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins&gt;walks past &lt;/ins&gt;the lazy dog.&quot;)```Alternatively, you can create Redline with the text to be tested, and compare several times to see the results.```pythonfrom redlines import Redlinestest = Redlines(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&quot;)assert (        test.compare(&quot;The quick brown fox walks past the lazy dog.&quot;)        == &quot;The quick brown fox &lt;del&gt;jumps over &lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins&gt;walks past &lt;/ins&gt;the lazy dog.&quot;)assert (        test.compare(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the dog.&quot;)        == &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the &lt;del&gt;lazy &lt;/del&gt;dog.&quot;)```Redlines also features a simple command line tool `redlines` to visualise the differences in text in the terminal.``` Usage: redlines text [OPTIONS] SOURCE TEST                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Compares the strings SOURCE and TEST and produce a redline in the terminal. ```### Custom styling in markdownBy default, markdown output is styled in &quot;red_green&quot;.Set the `markdown_style` option in the constructor or compare function to change the styling.The other available styles are &quot;red&quot;, &quot;none&quot; and &quot;ghfm&quot;.You can also use css classes to provide custom styling by setting `markdown_style` as &quot;custom_css&quot;.Insertions and deletions are now styled using the &quot;redline-inserted&quot; and &quot;redline-deleted&quot; CSS classes.You can also set your own CSS classes by specifying the name of the CSS class in the options &quot;ins_class&quot;and &quot;del_class&quot; respectively in the constructor or compare function.### Redlines does not seem to work under certain markdown environments, eg. Streamlit or GitHub**Styling may not appear in markdown environments which disallow HTML**. There is no consistent support forstrikethroughs and colors in the markdown standard, and styling is largely accomplished through raw HTML.If you are using GitHub or Streamlit, you may not get the formatting you expect or see any change at all.Try these options:* Enable use of HTML. In Streamlit, you need to set the `unsafe_allow_html` argument in `st.write` or `st.markdown`  to `True`.* Set `markdown_style` as &quot;ghfm&quot;: the GitHub Flavoured Markdown provides support for strikethrough (but no colours or  underline)* Set `markdown_style` as &quot;none&quot;: some environments only support a subset of HTML tags in markdown (for eg. GitHub).  This might include  the `ins` and `del` HTML tags used by this style. Styling usually follows that of the browser.## Uses* View and mark changes in legislation: [PLUS Explorer](https://houfu-plus-explorer.streamlit.app/)* Visualise changes after ChatGPT transforms a  text: [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)  Lesson 6## Roadmap / ContributingPlease feel free to post issues and comments. I work on this in my free time, so please excuse lack of activity.For questions and discussions, you can join [my matrix room on matrix.esq.social.](https://chat.matrix.esq.social/#/room/#redlines:matrix.esq.social) Matrix is a federated communication platform similar to Discord.### Nice things to do* &lt;s&gt;Style the way changes are presented&lt;/s&gt;* Other than Markdown, have other output formats (HTML? PDF?)* Associate changes with an author* Show different changes by different authors or times.If this was useful to you, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:houfu@lovelawrobots.com)!## LicenseMIT License</longdescription>
