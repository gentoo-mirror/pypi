	<longdescription># Fusion 360 StreamerThis is a re-implementation of the `streamer.exe` application used by Fusion 360(maybe from other Autodesk products too?) to install the application. The samebinary (just bundled with everything in a single exe) is used by the &quot;Admin Install&quot;exe.This software is completely unrelated to the Autodesk corporation and its subsidiariesand is the product of reverse engineering (legal within the EU).## InstallationAll installation methods will install both the GUI and CLI versions of the software.Just running the binary (or python module) will open the GUI and passing any argumentswill run the CLI version.### All-in-one binary (recommended)Download the single binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/dzervas/fusion360-streamer/releases)for your operating system and run it.### Python moduleInstall the python module with `pip install --upgrade --user fusion360-streamer`and run it with `fusion360-streamer`.### From source (for developers)Clone the repository, use pipenv to install the dev dependencies and run `python -m fusion360_streamer`:```bashgit clone https://github.com/dzervas/fusion360-streamer.gitcd fusion360-streamerpipenv install --devpipenv shellpython -m fusion360_streamer```## Why did you write this?The main reason is to add version history to Fusion 360. A daily GitHub workflowis run which checks for a new version and if one exists stores all the links toarchive.org. That way safe versions of Fusion 360 can be downloaded and installedthat are no longer available on Autodesk's website.It also serves as a much easier way to install Fusion 360 on Linux under wine.</longdescription>
