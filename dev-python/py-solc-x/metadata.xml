If you wish to compile from source you must first insall the required [solc dependencies](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source).## Installation### via `pip````bashpip install py-solc-x```### via `setuptools````bashgit clone https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/py-solc-x.gitcd py-solc-xpython3 setup.py install```## DocumentationDocumentation is hosted at [Read the Docs](https://solcx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).## TestingPy-solc-x is tested on Linux, OSX and Windows with solc versions `&gt;=0.4.11`.To run the test suite:```bashpytest tests/```By default, the test suite installs all available `solc` versions for your OS. If you only wish to test against already installed versions, include the `--no-install` flag.## ContributingHelp is always appreciated!
