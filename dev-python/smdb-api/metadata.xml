	<longdescription># Server monitoring Discord bot APIThis API can be used to interface with the server monitoring Discord bot only if the API is enabled on it. For this, the bot needs to run on the same PC, or the API needs to be set up to allow outside connections.## UsageTo create an api, import the package, and use the required arguments.```import smdb_apiAPI = smdb_api.API(&quot;Test&quot;, &quot;80716cbfd9f90428cd308acc193b4b58519a4f10a7440b97aaffecf75e63ecec&quot;)```Avaleable arguments: - name:            string              | Used to identify the application to the api server. - key:             string              | Used to verify identity with the api server. - ip:              string (optional)   | Used to set the api server's IP address. - port:            integer (optional)  | Used to set the api server's listening port. - update_function: function (optional) | Sets a callback function to call, when the api server updates.To initiate the connection, use the validate command. The validate function can get a timeout limit, so it won't hault the program, if the api server won't ansvear within a set time.```API.validate()server_status = API.get_status()```To add a command to the bot, use the 'create_function' command, like shown here:```[...]def my_callback(message):    #Does somethingAPI.create_function(&quot;MyScript&quot;, &quot;Some text to help\nUsage: &amp;MyScript &lt;User input&gt;\nCategory: SERVER&quot;, my_callback)```To send a message to someone, use the 'send_message' command:```[...]discordId=&quot;##################&quot;API.send_message(&quot;Test message to a channel&quot;, discordId)print(f&quot;I sent a message to {API.get_username(discordId)}!&quot;)```Closing the connection safely is easy with the 'close' command.```[...]API.close(&quot;Some reason for the bot logger.&quot;)```## Available commands### validateThis function connects to the API server and validates itself with it. If the validation was successful, it starts a listener thread.### get_statusThis function retrieves the bot's status and returns it in a dictionary.### get_usernameThis command returns the given Discord ID's username.### is_adminDetermines if a user is admin in the bot's database.### send_messageThis command allows you to send messages in the bot's name to selected users/channels or the default channel.### create_functionThis command creates a function in the bot that can be called by a user.### connect_to_voiceThis command connects the client to the user's voice channel### disconnect_from_voiceThis command disconnects the client from the user's voice channel### play_fileStarts the audio file on the path provided.
