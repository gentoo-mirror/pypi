	<longdescription># xbstrap: Build system for OS distributionsxbstrap is a build system designed to build &quot;distributions&quot; consisting of multiple (usually many) packages.It does not replace neither `make` and `ninja` nor `autoconf`, `automake`, `meson` or `cmake` and similar utilities.Instead, xbstrap is intended to invoke those build systems in the correct order, while respecting inter-package dependencies.**Official Discord server:** https://discord.gg/7WB6Ur3## Installationxbstrap is available from PyPI. To install it using pip, use:```pip3 install xbstrap```## Basic usageSee the [boostrap-managarm repository](https://github.com/managarm/bootstrap-managarm) for an example `bootstrap.yml` file.Installing all tools (that run on the build system) is done using:```xbstrap install-tool --all```Installing all packages to a sysroot (of the host system):```xbstrap install --all```It is often useful to rebuild specific packages. Rebuilding package `foobar` can be done by:```xbstrap install --rebuild foobar```If the `configure` script shall be run again, use instead:```xbstrap install --reconfigure foobar```## Local developmentWhen developing `xbstrap`, you must install your local copy instead of the one provided by the `pip` repositories. To do this, run:```pip install --user -e .```### Development with DockerFor containerized builds, most `xbstrap` commands will run in two stages: once on the host, then again on the container toactually execute the build steps. Therefore, installing `xbstrap` locally (as shown above) is not sufficient in this case.In addition, you must change your `Dockerfile` so that instead of grabbing `xbstrap` from the `pip` repositories, it installs from the host:1. Add the following lines (replace `/local-xbstrap` at your convenience):```dockerADD xbstrap /local-xbstrapRUN pip3 install -e /local-xbstrap```1. Copy or symlink your local `xbstrap` into the same folder that contains the `Dockerfile`, so that it can be accessed by the previous step.1. Rebuild the docker container as usual.### Enabling the pre-commit hook for linting (optional)To avoid running into the CI complaining about formatting, linting can be done in a pre-commit hook. To enable this, run:```git config core.hooksPath .githooks```</longdescription>
