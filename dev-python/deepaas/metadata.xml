By usingthe DEEPaaS API users can easily run a REST API in front of their model, thusaccessing its functionality via HTTP calls. DEEPaaS API leverages the [OpenAPIspecification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).# DocumentationThe DEEPaaS documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://deepaas.readthedocs.io/).## QuickstartThe best way to quickly try the DEEPaaS API is through:    make runThis command will install a virtualenv (in the `virtualenv` directory) withDEEPaaS and all its dependencies and will run the DEEPaaS REST API, listeningon `127.0.0.1:5000`. If you browse to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` you will get theSwagger documentation page (i.e. the Swagger web UI).### Develop modeIf you want to run the code in develop mode (i.e. `pip install -e`), you canissue the following command before:    make develop# Citing[![DOI](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01517/status.svg)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01517)If you are using this software and want to cite it in any work, please use thefollowing:&gt; Lopez Garcia, A. &quot;DEEPaaS API: a REST API for Machine Learning and&gt; Deep Learning models&quot;.
