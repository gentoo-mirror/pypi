	<longdescription># Tailer: A tool for 3' end analysis of non-polyadenylated RNAs from 3' sequencing data## Requirements- ``Python &gt;= 3.6``- ``pysam``- ``Bio``- ``gffuitls``- ``requests``- ``tqdm``## Installation```bashpip install jla-tailer```## UsageGlobal alignment with a GTF annotation and SAM/BAM formatted files```bashTailer -a [GTF Annotation] [SAM or BAM Files]```Required Arguments* ``-a, --annotation``    - GTF formatted database to be used to infer 3' ends. Ensembl GTFs have worked well for this pipeline* ``[SAM or BAM Files]``    - Space separated list of sam/bam formatted file locations to perform 3' end tail analysisLocal alignment with with FASTA/Q and specific Ensembl IDs of interest or reference fasta```bashTailer -e [comma separated list of EnsIDs no spaces] [FASTA/Q files]Tailer -f fasta_reference_file.fasta [FASTA/Q files]```Required Arguments* ``-e, --ensids``    - Comma separated list of ensembl IDs. Either -e or -f inputs are required.* ``-f, --fasta``    - FASTA formatted file to align reads against. Either -f or -e inputs are required* ``[Trimmed FASTQ files]``    - Space separated FASTQ file locations for analysis.Optional arguments* ``-t, --threshold [int, default=100]``    - Any alignment identified further than this distance in nucleotides from the mature end will be considered spurious and discarded* ``-x, --trim [int, default=0]``    - Helper for local mode only, can remove X nucleotides from adapter on the 3' end* ``-read, --read [int, default=1]``    - Paired end only. 1 or 2 to signify which end contains the 3' end information.* ``-r, --rev_comp``    - If set, will reverse complement the reads. Necessary for some library prep methods* ``-f, --fasta``    - Use a fasta file as a reference instead of building one from ensembl IDs (Local Only)* ``-s, --sequence``    - Output sequence in the tail file. Useful for debugging.miRNA tailing (in development)```bashTailer --miRNA [sam files]```Determines tails using an alignment file (SAM/BAM) that was aligned to a fasta genome of mature miRNAsOptional arguments* ``--rpad [int, default=0]``    - Number of downstream nucleotides added to distinguish between post-transcriptional and genome-encoded tails</longdescription>
