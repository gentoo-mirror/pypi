Inspired by GitHub Copilot, NotebookCopilot is designed to help data scientists and engineers in developing professional, high-quality notebooks. It's likehaving your personal AI-powered assistant that helps you navigate through the Jupyter universe, seamlesslygenerating code and markdown cells based on your inputs.Imagine not having to start with a blank notebook every time. Sounds dreamy, right?&lt;h2 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; v1 Demo &lt;/h2&gt;https://github.com/talperetz/notebook-copilot/assets/11588598/02e2b030-adb3-42f2-bd6d-4a8451e3831f## Features- üöÄ GPT Based Generation: Notebook Copilot employs advanced GPT instances for precise and efficient code generation.- üíª Integrated with Any Notebook Environments: Seamless access within Jupyter Notebook and other popular platforms, boosting your productivity.- üß© Automatic Context Retrieval: Understands the full context of your notebook, ensuring consistent and relevant code generation.- üîë Bring Your Own Key: Flexibility to use your own OpenAI key for personalized code generation and optimal results.- üÜì Free and Open Source: Everyone can benefit from Notebook Copilot. It's our contribution to the coding community, aiming to make coding accessible, efficient, and fun.## Quickstart```python!pip install notebook_copilot%load_ext notebook_copilot``````python%copilot```## Walk-through0. Get an OpenAI [API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)1. Install Notebook Copilot directly from PyPI:```bashpip install notebook_copilot```2. Load the Notebook Copilot extension in your Jupyter notebook:```python%load_ext notebook_copilot# Optional: If you don't have OPENAI_API_KEY set in your environment, you can set it herefrom getpass import getpassimport osos.environ[&quot;OPENAI_API_KEY&quot;] = getpass(&quot;Enter your OpenAI Key: &quot;)```3. Start using Notebook Copilot Magic Functions in your notebook ‚Üì## ‚ú® Magic Functionsü™Ñ Enter Assistant Mode and let Copilot continuously generate professional code and markdown cells for you.```python%copilot```‚úçÔ∏è Leverage AI to create the next cell from your comments. It's like having a conversation with your notebook.```python%%code # Plot the confusion matrix for each model# Plot the precision-recall curve for Catboost```üìò Automatically generate markdown cells to explain the code in the current cell. Your code is now not only functional but also well-documented.```python%%explain# some code to explain‚Ä¶```‚ö° Improve the time complexity of the code in no time. Copilot will generate an alternative code cell that is optimized for speed.```python%%optimize# a code cell‚Ä¶```üé® 1 plot &gt;= 1000 data rows. Visualize your data with a single line of code.```python%%visualize# a code cell‚Ä¶```## Roadmap- [x] **Copilot Magic Function**: Continues the notebook for you, generating professional code and markdown cells, making  blank notebooks a thing of the past.- [x] **Generate Magic Function**: Turn Your Comments into Code- [x] **Explain Magic Function**: Generate Markdown Cells that Explain Your Code- [x] **Optimize Magic Function**: Generate an Aleternative Code Cell that is Optimized For Speed / Simplicity- [x] **Visualize Magic Function**: Generate a Cell that Visualize Your Data- [x] Speed improvenents  - [x] Support parallel cell generation- [x] Update underlying strategy and prompts- [ ] Support more llm providers  - [ ] Starcoder  - [ ] Anthropic    ## ContributingWe appreciate all contributions.
