It supports offline code processing using LlamaCpp and [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) withoutsharing your code with third parties, or you can use OpenAI if privacy is not a concern for you. Please note thattalk-codebase is still under development and is recommended for educational purposes, not for production use.&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/rsaryev/talk-codebase/assets/70219513/b5d338f9-14a5-417b-9690-83f5cd66facf&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;chat&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;## InstallationRequirement Python 3.8.1 or higher```bashpip install talk-codebase```After installation, you can use it to chat with your codebase in the current directory by running the following command:```bashtalk-codebase chat &lt;path&gt;```Select model type: Local or OpenAI&lt;img width=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;select_type&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/rsaryev/talk-codebase/assets/70219513/05196fe5-78ff-44ff-8ca3-0313ccef572a&quot;&gt;OpenAIIf you use the OpenAI model, you need an OpenAI API key.
