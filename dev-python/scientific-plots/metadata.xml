	<longdescription># Scientific PlotsCreate and save plots in scientific style## Table of Contents[[_TOC_]]## OverviewThis python module includes useful methods and definitions for various pythonprojects.The focus lies of on the automatic creation of a set of plots, which aredesigned to be used in scientific journals, dissertations and presentations.The most important components are the definitions of types compatiblefor numpy, located in `types_.py`, and the typing stubs in `stubs/`. Thesetyping stubs are also distributed in this package.## PlottingThe easiest way to implement the plotting features provided by this library, isto use one of the predefined function in `scientific_plots.default_plots`.Alternatively, any plotting functions can be decorated by using the`apply_styles` decorator in `scientific_plots.plot_settings`.For example, this could look like this:```import matplotlib.pyplot as pltfrom scientific_plots.plot_settings import apply_styles@apply_stylesdef plot_something() -&gt; None:    &quot;&quot;&quot;Example function.&quot;&quot;&quot;    plt.plot(...)    ...    plt.savefig(&quot;subfolder/your_plot_name.pdf&quot;)```The script will create a bunch of plots and place them in the given locationnext to your given path. Thus, it is advisable to create a different subfolderfor new plots.Alternatively, this package provides default plot settings in the submodule*default_plots*. The provided function apply a default design, which shouldlook good in most situations.```from scientific_plots.default_plots import plotplot(x, y, &quot;x_label&quot;, &quot;y_label&quot;, &quot;subfolder/filename.pdf&quot;)```## TypesAdditional Vector like types for numpy-arrays are provided in`scientifc_plots.types_`.  These types can be used for static type checkingusing mypy.## Typing StubsAddtional typing stubs for scipy, matplotlib and numba are provided andinstalled by this package. These packages do not provide type hints on theirown.</longdescription>
