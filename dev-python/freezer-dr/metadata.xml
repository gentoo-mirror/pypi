Change things from this point on=========================Freezer Disaster Recovery=========================freezer-dr, OpenStack Compute node High Available provides compute node high availability for OpenStack.Simply freezer-dr monitors all compute nodes running in a cloud deployment and if there is any failurein one of the compute nodes freezer-dr will fence this compute node then freezer-dr will try to evacuate allrunning instances on this compute node, finally freezer-dr will notify all users who have workload/instancesrunning on this compute node as well as will notify the cloud administrators.freezer-dr has a pluggable architecture so it can be used with:1. Any monitoring system to monitor the compute nodes (currently we support only native OpenStack services status)2. Any fencing driver (currently supports IPMI, libvirt, ...)3. Any evacuation driver (currently supports evacuate api call, may be migrate ??)4. Any notification system (currently supports email based notifications, ...)just by adding a simple plugin and adjust the configuration file to use thisplugin or in future a combination of plugins if requiredfreezer-dr should run in the control plane, however the architecture supports different scenarios.For running freezer-dr under high availability mode, it should run with active passive mode.------------How it works------------Starting freezer-dr:1. freezer-dr Monitoring manager is going to load the required monitoring driver according to the configuration2. freezer-dr will query the monitoring system to check if it considers any compute nodes to be down ?3. if no, freezer-dr will exit displaying No failed nodes4. if yes, freezer-dr will call the fencing manager to fence the failed compute node5. Fencing manager will load the correct fencer according to the configuration6. once the compute node is fenced and is powered off now we will start the evacuation process7. freezer-dr will load the correct evacuation driver8. freezer-dr will evacuate all instances to another computes9. Once the evacuation process completed, freezer-dr will call the notification manager10. The notification manager will load the correct driver based on the configurations11. freezer-dr will start the notification process ...</longdescription>
