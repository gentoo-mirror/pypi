Check out our guide &lt;a href=&quot;https://mit-ll-responsible-ai.github.io/hydra-zen/how_to/pytorch_lightning.html&quot;&gt;for using PyTorch Lightning with hydra-zen.⚡&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;hydra-zen is a Python library that simplifies the process of writing code (research-grade or production-grade) that is:- **Configurable**: you can configure all aspects of your code from a single interface (the command line or a single Python function).- **Repeatable**: each run of your code will be self-documenting; the full configuration of your software is saved alongside your results.- **Scalable**: launch multiple runs of your software, be it on your local machine or across multiple nodes on a cluster.It builds off – and is fully compatible with – [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/), a framework for elegantly configuring complex applications. hydra-zen helps simplify the process of using Hydra by providing specialized functions for creating configs and launching Hydra jobs. Please refer to [our documentation](https://mit-ll-responsible-ai.github.io/hydra-zen/) for examples and more details.  ## Installation`hydra-zen` is lightweight: its only dependencies are `hydra-core` and `typing-extensions`.```consolepip install hydra-zen```## ContributingBefore opening a PR to this repo, consider posting an [issue](https://github.com/mit-ll-responsible-ai/hydra-zen/issues) or a [discussion topic](https://github.com/mit-ll-responsible-ai/hydra-zen/discussions) to share your ideas with us.
