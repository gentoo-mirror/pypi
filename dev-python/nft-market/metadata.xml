You can, off course, request them in issues if neededimmediately. Either PRs or issues are always welcome!### Currently supported explorersThe following explorers are supported in **nft-market**.If possible, using these explorers is recommended rather than using the above marketplaces, such as Enterpot, for more stability.- [ICScan](https://icscan.io/nft) (Supporting: ICP)- [NFTgeek](https://t5t44-naaaa-aaaah-qcutq-cai.raw.ic0.app/) (Supporting: ICP)### How to get the ID of a NFT?Although it depends on which marketplace you use, you can basically find it in the URL.#### Example 1: OpenSeaWhen you want to retrieve the information of the NFT of [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub), the URL looks like `https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub`. In this URL, what differs according to a NFT is the part of `boredapeyachtclub`, which is all you need to use **nft-market**.#### Example 2: tofuNFTURLs look like `https://tofunft.com/collection/astardegens/items`. In this case, what **nft-market** requires is onlythe part of `astardegens`.#### Other examplesWe have several examples of the usage in [samples.py](https://github.com/ukaznil/nft-market/blob/master/samples.py) forreferences.### Available informationWhat you can retrieve may change by a marketplace you specify, as follows.Other information may be provided in the future!| Market        | Name    | #Supply | #Listing | #Owners    | Floor   | Volume  ||---------------|---------|---------|----------|------------|---------|---------|| OpenSea       | &amp;check; | &amp;check; |          |            | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || Entrepot      | &amp;check; |         | &amp;check;  |            | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || tofuNFT       | &amp;check; |         | &amp;check;  | &amp;check;    | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || PancakeSwap   | &amp;check; | &amp;check; | &amp;check;  |            | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || Rarible       | &amp;check; | &amp;check; |          | &amp;check;    | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || GhostMarket   | &amp;check; | &amp;check; |          | &amp;check;    | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || Crypto.com    | &amp;check; |         | &amp;check;  | &amp;check;    | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || Gem           | &amp;check; |         | &amp;check;  |            | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || NFTrade       | &amp;check; |         |          |            | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || Solanart      | &amp;check; | &amp;check; |          | &amp;check;    | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || Magic Eden    | &amp;check; |         | &amp;check;  |            | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || XANALIA       | &amp;check; | &amp;check; |          | &amp;check;    | &amp;check; | &amp;check; | | CetoSwap      | &amp;check; | &amp;check; | &amp;check;  | &amp;check;    | &amp;check; | &amp;check; | | Coinbase      | &amp;check; |         | &amp;check;  | &amp;check;    | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || CCC           | &amp;check; | &amp;check; | &amp;check;  | &amp;check;(*) | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || Nifty Gateway | &amp;check; |         | &amp;check;  | &amp;check;    | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || Jelly         | &amp;check; | &amp;check; |          | &amp;check;    | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || YUMI          | &amp;check; |         | &amp;check;  | &amp;check;    | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || Explorer | Ecosystem | Name    | #Supply | #Listing  | #Owners | Floor   | Volume  ||----------|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|| ICScan   | ICP       | &amp;check; | &amp;check; | &amp;check;   | &amp;check; | &amp;check; | &amp;check; || NFTgeek  | ICP       | &amp;check; | &amp;check; | &amp;check;   | &amp;check; | &amp;check; | &amp;check; |&quot;&amp;check;(*)&quot; means it can return None value depending on items.## InstallationYou can install **nft-market** by pip.```shell$ pip install nft-market```Also, as **nft-market** depends on Firefox and its driver, you need to install them.```shell[mac]$ brew install firefox[ubuntu]$ sudo apt install firefox```Besides, all Python dependencies are listed up in `requirements.txt`. Please install themby `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` if you install **nft-market** not by pip but by cloning from GitHub.## For developersYou can run tests similarly as GitHub Actions in your local environment by using [ACT](https://github.com/nektos/act).We highly recommend you try this for at least what you added before push.### Installation```shell# mac$ brew install act# Linux$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash# Windows Chocolatey$ choco install act-cli# Windows Scoop$ scoop install act```### How to use act?Make sure that you're already running Docker Desktop, and then just run act!```shell$ act push --container-architecture linux/amd64```Note that when you see choices as for the default size of images, you need at least &quot;Medium&quot;.```shellDefault image and other options can be changed manually in ~/.actrc (please refer to https://github.com/nektos/act#configuration for additional information about file structure)  [Use arrows to move, type to filter, ? for more help]  Large&gt; Medium  Micro```</longdescription>
