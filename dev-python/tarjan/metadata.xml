	<longdescription>Python implementation of Tarjan's algorithm===========================================Tarjan's algorithm takes as input a directed (possibly cyclic!) graph andreturns as output its strongly connected components in a topological order.Example-------.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwesterb/py-tarjan/master/doc/example.png.. code::   &gt;&gt;&gt; tarjan({1:[2],2:[1,5],3:[4],4:[3,5],5:[6],6:[7],7:[8],8:[6,9],9:[]})   [[9], [8, 7, 6], [5], [2, 1], [4, 3]]Uses----Cyclic dependencies~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In various cases, dependencies might be cyclic and a group of interdependantactions must be executed simultaneously.  It is not uncommon thatthe simulataneous execution is costly.  With Tarjan's algorithm, one candetermine an efficient order in which to execute the groups of interdependantactions.Transitive closure~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Using Tarjan's algorithm, one can efficiently compute the transitiveclosure of a graph.  (Given a graph *G*, the transitive closure of *G*is a graph that contains the same vertices and contains an edge from *v*to *w* if and only if there is a path from *v* to *w* in *G*.)The transitive closure is implemented in `tarjan.tc`:.. code::    &gt;&gt;&gt; from tarjan.tc import tc    &gt;&gt;&gt; tc({1:[2],2:[1,5],3:[4],4:[3,5],5:[6],6:[7],7:[8],8:[6,9],9:[]})    {1: (1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9),     2: (1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9),     3: (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9),     4: (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9),     5: (8, 9, 6, 7),     6: (8, 9, 6, 7),     7: (8, 9, 6, 7),     8: (8, 9, 6, 7),     9: ()}Expand group hierarchies~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Given a graph of groups, one can use the transitive closure to determineall indirect members of a group.  (Someone is an indirect member of a group,if it is a member of a group that is a member of a group that ... is a memberof the group.)Installation------------Simply execute.. code::    pip install tarjanor from this source distribution, run.. code::    python setup.py install.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/bwesterb/py-tarjan.png   :target: https://travis-ci.org/bwesterb/py-tarjanTarjan Changelog================0.2.4 (2023-04-14)------------------- Support Python 3.8 - 3.11- Drop support for Python 2.6, 3.2 - 3.7- Change license to LGPLv3- Switch to Github actions- Add flake8 linting0.2.3.2 (2016-12-28)--------------------- Python 3.6 support0.2.3.1 (2015-11-22)--------------------- Python 3.4 &amp; 3.5 support0.2.3 (2015-02-19)------------------- Fix packaging bug [#6]0.2.2 (2015-02-18)------------------- Removed dynamic version specifier- Converted docs to rst for better docs on pypiThanks-to: Patrick Gerken (github.com/d03cc)</longdescription>
