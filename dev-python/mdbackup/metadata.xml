It is recommended to use a virtual environment to do that. We will show you this way.**What do yo need?**:  - Any OS with Python support and POSIX-like (e.g.: Linux, macOS, *BSD...)  - Python 3.6 or higherFirst select a folder where all the needed files will be stored. It is important not to move (or rename) this folder after installation.Run one of those commands. If both fail, try to install `python3-virtualenv` (debian based) or `pip3 install virtualenv` (on macOS).```bashpython3 -m venv .venvpython3 -m virtualenv .venv```When you have the virtual environment created, you have to activate it. With this, you can run python commands and everything you do, will alter the virtual env, not the real one (and so, you don't need `sudo` to do things).```bash. .venv/bin/activatepip install --upgrade setuptools wheelpip install mdbackup```Now you can run the utility (only if you have enabled the virtual env) with `mdbackup`. In this folder it is recommended to store the `config` folder. &gt; **Note:** to be able to use some of the cloud storage and secrets backends, you will be requested to install some packages. Go to the documentation to see what is needed.## DocumentationCan be found at [mdbackup.majorcadevs.com](https://mdbackup.majorcadevs.com/) or at the docs folder.To make the documentation, install the requirements in `docs/requirements.txt` and run `mkdocs serve`.</longdescription>
