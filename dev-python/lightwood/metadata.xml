	<longdescription># Lightwood&lt;!--- badges here? ---&gt;Lightwood is an AutoML framework that enables you to generate and customize machine learning pipelines declarative syntax called JSON-AI.Our goal is to make the data science/machine learning (DS/ML) life cycle easier by allowing users to focus on **what** they want to do their data without needing to write repetitive boilerplate code around machine learning and data preparation. Instead, we enable you to focus on the parts of a model that are truly unique and custom.Lightwood works with a variety of data types such as numbers, dates, categories, tags, text, arrays and various multimedia formats. These data types can be combined together to solve complex problems. We also support a time-series mode for problems that have between-row dependencies.Our JSON-AI syntax allows users to change any and all parts of the models Lightwood automatically generates. The syntax outlines the specifics details in each step of the modeling pipeline. Users may override default values (for example, changing the type of a column) or alternatively, entirely replace steps with their own methods (ex: use a random forest model for a predictor). Lightwood creates a &quot;JSON-AI&quot; object from this syntax which can then be used to automatically generate python code to represent your pipeline.For details on how to generate JSON-AI syntax and how Lightwood works, check out the [Lightwood Philosophy](#Lightwood-Philosophy).## Lightwood PhilosophyLightwood abstracts the ML pipeline into 3 core steps:(1) Pre-processing and data cleaning &lt;br&gt;(2) Feature engineering &lt;br&gt;(3) Model building and training &lt;br&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/lightwood.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lightwood internals&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;#### i) Pre-processing and cleaningFor each column in your dataset, Lightwood will identify the suspected data type (numeric, categorical, etc.) via a brief statistical analysis. From this, it will generate a JSON-AI syntax. If the user keeps default behavior, Lightwood will perform a brief pre-processing approach to clean each column according to its identified data type. From there, it will split the data into train/dev/test splits.The `cleaner` and `splitter` objects respectively refer to the pre-processing and the data splitting functions.#### ii) Feature EngineeringData can be converted into features via &quot;encoders&quot;. Encoders represent the rules for transforming pre-processed data into a numerical representations that a model can be used. Encoders can be **rule-based** or **learned**. A rule-based encoder transforms data per a specific set of instructions (ex: normalized numerical data) whereas a learned encoder produces a representation of the data after training (ex: a &quot;\[CLS\]&quot; token in a language model).Encoders are assigned to each column of data based on the data type; users can override this assignment either at the column-based level or at the data-type based level. Encoders inherit from the `BaseEncoder` class. #### iii) Model Building and TrainingWe call a predictive model that intakes *encoded* feature data and outputs a prediction for the target of interest a `mixer` model. Users can either use Lightwood's default mixers or create their own approaches inherited from the `BaseMixer` class.We predominantly use PyTorch based approaches, but can support other models.## UsageWe invite you to check out our [documentation](https://lightwood.io) for specific guidelines and tutorials! Please stay tuned for updates and changes. ### Quick use casesLightwood works with `pandas.DataFrames`. Once a DataFrame is loaded, defined a &quot;ProblemDefinition&quot; via a dictionary. The only thing a user needs to specify is the name of the column to predict (via the key `target`).Create a JSON-AI syntax from the command `json_ai_from_problem`. Lightwood can then use this object to *automatically generate python code filling in the steps of the ML pipeline* via `code_from_json_ai`. You can make a `Predictor` object, instantiated with that code via `predictor_from_code`. To train a `Predictor` end-to-end, starting with unprocessed data, users can use the `predictor.learn()` command with the data.```pythonimport pandas as pdfrom lightwood.api.high_level import (    ProblemDefinition,    json_ai_from_problem,    code_from_json_ai,    predictor_from_code,)if __name__ == '__main__':    # Load a pandas dataset    df = pd.read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindsdb/benchmarks/main/benchmarks/datasets/hdi/data.csv&quot;    )    # Define the prediction task by naming the target column    pdef = ProblemDefinition.from_dict(        {            &quot;target&quot;: &quot;Development Index&quot;,  # column you want to predict        }    )    # Generate JSON-AI code to model the problem    json_ai = json_ai_from_problem(df, problem_definition=pdef)    # OPTIONAL - see the JSON-AI syntax    # print(json_ai.to_json())    # Generate python code    code = code_from_json_ai(json_ai)    # OPTIONAL - see generated code    # print(code)    # Create a predictor from python code    predictor = predictor_from_code(code)    # Train a model end-to-end from raw data to a finalized predictor    predictor.learn(df)    # Make the train/test splits and show predictions for a few examples    test_df = predictor.split(predictor.preprocess(df))[&quot;test&quot;]    preds = predictor.predict(test_df).iloc[:10]    print(preds)```### BYOM: Bring your own modelsLightwood supports user architectures/approaches so long as you follow the abstractions provided within each step. Our [tutorials](https://mindsdb.github.io/lightwood/tutorials.html) provide specific use cases for how to introduce customization into your pipeline. Check out &quot;custom cleaner&quot;, &quot;custom splitter&quot;, &quot;custom explainer&quot;, and &quot;custom mixer&quot;. Stay tuned for further updates.## InstallationYou can install Lightwood as follows:```pythonpip3 install lightwood```&gt;Note: depending on your environment, you might have to use pip instead of pip3 in the above command.However, we recommend creating a python virtual environment.#### Setting up a dev environment- Python version should be in the range &gt;=3.7, &lt; 3.10- Clone lightwood- `cd lightwood &amp;&amp; pip install -r requirements.txt &amp;&amp; pip install -r requirements_image.txt`- Add it to your python path (e.g. by adding `export PYTHONPATH='/where/you/cloned/lightwood':$PYTHONPATH` as a newline at the end of your `~/.bashrc` file)- Check that the `unittest`s are passing by going into the directory where you cloned lightwood and running: `python -m unittest discover tests` &gt; If `python` default to python2.x on your environment use `python3` and `pip3` insteadCurrently, the preferred environment for working with lightwood is visual studio code, a very popular python IDE. However, any IDE should work. While we don't have guides for those, please feel free to use the following section as a template for VSCode, or to contribute your own tips and tricks to set up other IDEs.#### Setting up a VSCode environment* Install and enable setting sync using github account (if you use multiple machines)* Install pylance (for types) and make sure to disable pyright* Go to `Python &gt; Lint: Enabled` and disable everything *but* flake8* Set `python.linting.flake8Path` to the full path to flake8 (which flake8)* Set `Python › Formatting: Provider` to autopep8* Add `--global-config=&lt;path_to&gt;/lightwood/.flake8` and `--experimental` to `Python › Formatting: Autopep8 Args`* Install live share and live share whiteboard&lt;!--- CONTRIBUTING.md ----&gt;## Contribute to LightwoodWe love to receive contributions from the community and hear your opinions!
