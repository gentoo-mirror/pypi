Being writtenin Python, we can create a library of tasks and publish them on PyPI for reuse.The [package for this repo][package] includes these tasks.To start using the tasks in a repo, add a `tasks.py` file and import thecollection of tasks appropriate for the repo. For instance, for a frontend app:```# tasks.pyfrom dmdevtools.invoke_tasks import frontend_app_tasks as ns```The `as ns` part is needed so that the `invoke` command line tool sees theimported tasks, read the [Invoke documentation on collections andnamespaces][1] for more details on how this works.For backwards-compatibility, `make` can still be used for a repo. Just copy the[`Makefile` from this repo](Makefile) (or just the `%` goal), and anyunrecognised goals will be sent to `invoke`.[1]: http://docs.pyinvoke.org/en/stable/concepts/namespaces.html#starting-out## LicenceUnless stated otherwise this codebase is released under [the MITLicense][licence].
