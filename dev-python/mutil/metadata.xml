	<longdescription># mutilUtilities for managing memory resources with cgroupsMemory management is an important consideration for a multi-user computing server, because if users collectively attempt to use more memory than is available on the system, it may crash. A useful means of preventing this is [cgroups](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man7/cgroups.7.html) which can assign users to &quot;control groups&quot; which are limited to a given quantity of resources (such as CPU, disk, or memory usage).However, `cgroups` are somewhat complicated to use in practice. `mutil` streamlines the memory management component.## InstallationTo install `mutil`:```shconda create -c conda-forge -n mutil psutilconda activate mutilpip install mutil```You may wish to include `mutil` and `nvtop` in one environment:```shconda create -c conda-forge -n mutil-nvtop psutil nvtopconda activate mutil-nvtoppip install mutil```You can also install it in an existing environment by simply using `pip install mutil`. Then you can check it with:```shmutil --versionmutil --help````mutil` maintains Induct a user```shmutil induct -u &lt;username&gt;```Check your memory usage```shmutil usage```Check usage of another user```shmutil usage -u &lt;username&gt;```Check usage of a group```shmutil usage -g free```</longdescription>
