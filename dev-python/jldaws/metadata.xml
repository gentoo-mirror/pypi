	<longdescription>Overview--------This package contains a collection of Amazon Web Service related scripts e.g.* jldsqsjob : wait for stdin trigger, dequeue msg(s) from SQS Q#1, send to stdout, requeue to SQS Q#2, delete msg(s) from Q#1* jlds3upload : automated file upload to S3* jlds3download : automated file download from S3* jldrxsqs : receive from an SQS queue to JSON/string stdout (with optional stdin trigger)* jldtxsqs : transmit on SQS JSON/string from stdin* jldleader: distributed leader election protocol manager* jlds3up  : simple file upload to s3 with functionality to delete 'old' files* jlds3list : listing files in an S3 bucket* jldsdb: list, create and delete operations on SDB* jldsdbget: retrieve entries in SDB* jldsdbinsert: insert records in SDB* jldsdbbatchinsert: batch insert records in SDB from fileThe philosophy behind these scripts is:* simplicity  : each script only does 1 thing* reporting   : status &amp; error reporting through stderr and (optionally) JSON stdout* data driven : object in from src ==&gt; object out to dst* data flow   : piping through stdin / stdout    Scripts can easily be &quot;composed&quot; through standard Linux piping :    jldrxsqs @config1.txt | some_other_command | jldtxsqs @config2.txtThe data format used is JSON.Configuration-------------Can be performed through options on the command line or using a file (use a leading `@`).History-------Changes history can be found at the project page: https://github.com/jldupont/jldaws</longdescription>
