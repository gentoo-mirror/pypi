Amplicon reads start with a primer sequence.Poly-A tails are useful for pulling out RNA from your sample, but often youdon’t want them to be in your reads.Cutadapt helps with these trimming tasks by finding the adapter or primersequences in an error-tolerant way. It can also modify and filter single-endand paired-end reads in various ways. Adapter sequences can contain IUPACwildcard characters. Cutadapt can also demultiplex your reads.Cutadapt is available under the terms of the MIT license.Cutadapt development was started at `TU Dortmund University &lt;https://www.tu-dortmund.de&gt;`_in the group of `Prof. Dr. Sven Rahmann &lt;https://www.rahmannlab.de/&gt;`_.It is currently being developed within`NBIS (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) &lt;https://nbis.se/&gt;`_.If you use Cutadapt, please cite`DOI:10.14806/ej.17.1.200 &lt;http://dx.doi.org/10.14806/ej.17.1.200&gt;`_ .Links-----* `Documentation &lt;https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_* `Source code &lt;https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt/&gt;`_* `Report an issue &lt;https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt/issues&gt;`_* `Project page on PyPI (Python package index) &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cutadapt/&gt;`_* `Wrapper for the Galaxy platform &lt;https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/master/tools/cutadapt&gt;`_</longdescription>
