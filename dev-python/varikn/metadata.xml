	<longdescription>VariKN language modeling toolkit provides tools for training n-gramlanguage models. Amongst the supported methods are:- Absolute discounting- Kneser-Ney smoothing- Revised Kneser pruning- Kneser-Ney growingThe descriptions of Revised Kneser pruning and Kneser-Ney growing canbe found in the paper Vesa Siivola, Teemu Hirsim√§ki and Sami Virpioja,&quot;On Growing and Pruning Kneser-Ney Smoothed N-Gram Models&quot;, IEEETransactions on Speech, Audio and Language Processing,15(5):1617-1624, 2007.The package provides a accurate pruning for Kneser-Ney smoothedmodels. Also, it is possible to train a very high-order n-gram modelswith the growing algorithm. The models can be output to arpa lmformat, which is compatible with most common other tools in thefield. You can look at the paper Vesa Siivola, Mathias Creutz andMikko Kurimo: &quot;Morfessor and VariKN machine learning tools for speechand language technology&quot;, Proceedings of the 8th InternationalConference on Speech Communication and Technology (INTERSPEECH'07),2007 for guidelines on typical use.For help on installing the toolkit, read [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).For help on using the built commands, read [commands.html](commands.html).If it looks like there is interest in using the toolkit but thedocumentation is inadequate, let me know the main sticking points andI'll try to do something about it. If you are interested in a wellsupported toolkit that provides a wide range of functionality, youmight want to look at the [srilm toolkit](http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/).</longdescription>
