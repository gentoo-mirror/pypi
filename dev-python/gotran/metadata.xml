See further instructions in  INSTALL- can load models from external ODE description files such as CellML## InstallYou can install gotran through pip```python -m pip install gotran```or if you want to work with the latest version you can install the developement version by either cloning the repository and run```python -m pip install git+https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/gotran.git```## DocumentationDocumentation can be found here: &lt;http://computationalphysiology.github.io/gotran/&gt;## Source codeSource code can be found at &lt;https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/gotran&gt;.## Licensegotran is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.gotran is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
