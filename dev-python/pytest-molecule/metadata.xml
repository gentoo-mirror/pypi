Current default is ``None`` but youcan choose marks like ``skip`` or ``xfail``.Using xfail and skip markers----------------------------If you need to skip or ignore a particular scenario, just add either ``xfail``or ``skip`` to markers list inside its config file... code-block:: yaml    markers:      - xfail  # broken scenario, pytest will run it but ignore the resultInstallation------------You can install &quot;pytest-molecule&quot; via pip_ from PyPI_:.. code-block:: shell    $ PIP_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION=false pip install pytest-molecule``PIP_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION`` is needed only on ancient python distributions toworkaround https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5229Contributing------------Contributions are very welcome.
