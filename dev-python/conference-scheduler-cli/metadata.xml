	<longdescription>Conference Scehduler Command Line Interface===========================================A command line tool to manage the schedule for a conference.Installation============The library requires Python 3.6 or later. The simplest way to install is::    pip install conference-scheduler-cliTo install from source code::    git clone https://github.com/PyConUK/ConferenceScheduler-cli    cd ConferenceScheduler-cli    python setup.py installQuick Start===========The tool expects to find a directory with the necessary data files to definethe conference. By default it will look for a directory named `input` underthe current working directory.It will generate YAML files in the format required by the conferencewebsite. By default, these will be placed a in a `build` directory under thecurrent working directory.It will also generate `.csv` and `.pickle` files to store the calculatedschedule and its associated definition and a log file with the full details ofthe most recent calculation. By default, these will be placed in a`solution` directory under the current working directory.The `input`, `solution` and `build` directories can be passed to the tool ascommand line options in place of the default locations.To build the schedule with the default options::    scheduler buildThere are also further options, e.g. to set the logging verbosity or thesolver algorithm to use. To view those options::    scheduler --helpor, for the options for a specifc command::    scheduler build --helpChangelog#########v0.10.1 (2017-10-02)--------------------* Minor: Fix line ending of schedule.csvv0.10.0 (2017-09-16)--------------------* Breaking Change: Output markdown files are no longer produced* New Feature: The ability to add 'unbounded' events which occur in all rooms  on all days* Minor: Speaker names in their original form are included within the pickled  events dictionary* Minor: The full slots list, with index number, is included in the log file* Minor: Allocated and unbounded events now have tags added automatically  which ensure uniqueness (no longer necessary to use e.g. 'morning' tag)* Bug Fix: Durations for unbounded and allocated events are taken from their  definition (previously hard coded as zero)v0.9.1 (2017-09-06)-------------------* Minor: io functions now take the working directories as arguments* Minor: All proposals now included in pickled resourcesv0.9.0 (2017-09-06)-------------------* New Feature: --reload option on validate command to control whether the  conference definition is reloaded from input YAML files* Bug Fix: --help option threw an error if run outside a valid project folder  structurev0.8.4 (2017-09-04)-------------------* Minor: Subtitles from proposals are now importedv0.8.3 (2017-09-02)-------------------* Bug Fix: Original schedule and new schedule were being passed to the diff  function in the wrong orderv0.8.2 (2017-09-01)-------------------* Bug Fix: Pre-allocated events were being scheduled in addition to their  pre-allocated slot when optimising for consistencyv0.8.1 (2017-08-24)-------------------* Minor: Order of fields altered in schedule.csvv0.8.0 (2017-08-21)-------------------* New Feature: --diff option to control logging of schedule diffv0.7.2 (2017-08-21)-------------------* Bug Fix: Consistency optimisation fixedv0.7.1 (2017-08-21)-------------------* Minor: Updated log message for Unavailabilityv0.7.0 (2017-08-21)-------------------* Bug Fix: Remove use of strings for Slot.starts_at* New Feature: Unavailability and clashes can now be defined for events as well  as people* New feature: Capacity objective now split into efficiency or equityv0.6.0 (2017-08-18)-------------------* New Feature: Pre-allocated events can be defined in allocations.yaml* Breaking Change: venues.yml renamed to timetable.ymlv0.5.0 (2017-08-17)-------------------* Breaking Change: content previously in separate yaml files now in venues.yaml* New Feature: objective function argument added to build commandv0.4.1 (2017-08-16)-------------------* Improved logging with counts of events and slots by event typev0.4.0 (2017-08-14)-------------------* New Feature: Venue availability can be defined* Minor Improvement: Order of columns in schedule.csv swapped to show index  numbers at lhs of filev0.3.1 (2017-08-10)-------------------* Bug Fix: Redundant export of schedule on rebuild removedv0.3.0 (2017-08-10)-------------------* New feature: Rebuild command  Rebuild the output files from a previously computed schedulev0.2.0 (2017-08-10)-------------------* New Featue: Validate command  Validate a previously computed schedulev0.1.0 (2017-08-10)-------------------* Initial release</longdescription>
