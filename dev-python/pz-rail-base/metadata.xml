Rubin Observatory,including Rubin-wide commissioning activities. RAIL was initiated by thePhotometric Redshifts (PZ) Working Group (WG) of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) as a result of the lessons learned from the [Data Challenge 1 (DC1) experiment](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/499/2/1587/5905416) to enable the PZ WG Deliverables in [the LSST-DESC Science Roadmap (see Sec. 5.18)](https://lsstdesc.org/assets/pdf/docs/DESC_SRM_latest.pdf), aiming to guide the selection and implementation of redshift estimators in DESCanalysis pipelines. RAIL is developed and maintained by a diverse teamcomprising DESC Pipeline Scientists (PSs), international in-kind contributors,LSST Interdisciplinary Collaboration for Computing (LINCC) Frameworks softwareengineers, and other volunteers, but all are welcome to join the teamregardless of LSST data rights. ## InstallationInstallation instructions are available under [Installation](https://lsstdescrail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/installation.html)on ReadTheDocs.## ContributingThe greatest strength of RAIL is its extensibility; those interested incontributing to RAIL should start by consulting the [Contributing guidelines](https://lsstdescrail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/contributing.html)on ReadTheDocs.## Citing RAILRAIL is open source and may be used according to the terms of its [LICENSE](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL/blob/main/LICENSE) [(BSD 3-Clause)](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).If you make use of the ideas or software here in any publication, you must citethis repository &lt;https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL&gt; as &quot;LSST-DESC PZ WG (in prep)&quot; with the [Zenodo DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7017551).Please consider also inviting the developers as co-authors on publicationsresulting from your use of RAIL by [making an issue](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL/issues/new/choose).Additionally, several of the codes accessible through the RAIL ecosystem must be cited if used in a publication. A convenient list of what to cite may be found under [Citing RAIL](https://lsstdescrail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/citing.html) on ReadTheDocs.</longdescription>
