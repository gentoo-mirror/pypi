A ``PatientGroup`` model instance contains patients who are represented by ``PatientLog`` model instances.Before a group is &quot;ready&quot; to randomize:* the group membership must meet the ratio of HIV, HTN, DM or multi-morbidity patients.* the group must meet the minimum group size.* all patients must be screened as eligible and consentedIf &quot;ready&quot;, the patient group is randomized when the ``PatientGroup`` model instance saves succcessfullywith field ``randomize_now`` set to YES.Randomization occurs in the signal ``randomize_patient_group_on_post_save``. The signalleaves most of the work to the class ``RandomizeGroup``. ``RandomizeGroup`` calls it's ``randomize`` method does the following:* The group is randomized to intervention or control;* ``PatientGroup`` model instance is allocated a ``group_identifier``;* Each ``PatientGroup`` model instance in the group is updated with the ``group_identifier``;* Each ``SubjectConsent`` model instance in the group is updated with the ``group_identifier`` (which triggers another signal associated with the subject consent. This signal puts the subject on schedule);* Each ``RegisteredSubject`` model instance in the group is updated with the ``group_identifier``;.. |pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/intecomm-edc.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/intecomm-edc.. |actions| image:: https://github.com/intecomm-trial/intecomm-edc/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=develop  :target: https://github.com/intecomm-trial/intecomm-edc/actions?query=workflow:build.. |codecov| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/intecomm-trial/intecomm-edc/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg  :target: https://codecov.io/gh/intecomm-trial/intecomm-edc.. |downloads| image:: https://pepy.tech/badge/intecomm-edc   :target: https://pepy.tech/project/intecomm-edc</longdescription>
