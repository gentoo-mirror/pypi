	<longdescription>GR - a universal framework for visualization applications=========================================================*GR* is a universal framework for cross-platform visualizationapplications. It offers developers a compact, portable and consistentgraphics library for their programs. Applications range from publicationquality 2D graphs to the representation of complex 3D scenes.*GR* is essentially based on an implementation of a Graphical KernelSystem (GKS) and OpenGL. As a self-contained system it can quickly andeasily be integrated into existing applications (i.e. using the``ctypes`` mechanism in Python or ``ccall`` in Julia).The *GR* framework can be used in imperative programming systems orintegrated into modern object-oriented systems, in particular thosebased on GUI toolkits. *GR* is characterized by its highinteroperability and can be used with modern web technologies. The *GR*framework is especially suitable for real-time or signal processingenvironments.*GR* was developed by the Scientific IT-Systems group at the PeterGruenberg Institute at Forschunsgzentrum Juelich. The main development hasbeen done by Josef Heinen who currently maintains the software, butthere are other developers who currently make valuable contributions.Special thanks to Florian Rhiem (*GR3*] and Christian Felder (qtgr,setup.py).Starting with release 0.6 *GR* can be used as a backend for`Matplotlib &lt;http://matplotlib.org&gt;`__ and significantly improve theperformance of existing Matplotlib or PyPlot applications written inPython or Julia, respectively. In`this &lt;http://gr-framework.org/tutorials/matplotlib.html&gt;`__ tutorialsection you can find some examples.Beginning with version 0.10.0 *GR* supports inline graphics which showsup in IPython's Qt Console or interactive computing environments for*Python* and *Julia*, such as `IPython &lt;http://ipython.org&gt;`__ and`Jupyter &lt;https://jupyter.org&gt;`__. An interesting example can be found`here &lt;http://pgi-jcns.fz-juelich.de/pub/doc/700K_460.html&gt;`__.For further information please refer to the`GR home page &lt;http://gr-framework.org&gt;`__.</longdescription>
