	<longdescription># Openpyxl_utilitiesThis project consists of a library with functionalities to work with the popular module openpyxl (mainly used to read and write xlsx and xls files from Python) more efficiently. It was kickstarted when I found out openpyxl package does not includes sorting fucntionalities to create xlsx files already sorted (the only option available was to set a sorting button to sort the rows inside Microsoft Excel, not creating the file already sorted).### PrerequisitesThis script is written in Python 3.6 using the following non-standard modules:* [openpyxl 2.5 or higher](https://github.com/chronossc/openpyxl)### InstallingFirst, make sure you have the prerequisites installed using the following command:```$pip freeze```If the list of installed modules does not includes openpyxl==2.5 or higher, run the following command:```$pip install openpyxl```Once the prerequisites are fullfiled, install the module with the following command:```$pip install openpyxl_utilities```If no errors are given, you can already import the module as any other module. To test if everything was correctly installed, run test.py, no error should rise.```$python test.py```If you are sure everything was installed correctly but there were errors, feel free to open an issue and let me help you get it working. n.n### List of functions (up to dated with version 1.0)* list_values* adjust_col_width* print_sheet* empty_row* max_length_of_column* transpose* sort_sheet_by* apply_format* col_to_num* num_to_col### Authors* **SebastiÃ¡n MatÃas Carreira**### Acknowledgments* **Felipe Prenholato** - @chronossc : For his work on openpyxl, core module of these functions* **NicolÃ¡s Fusaro** - @mnfusaro : For his help in QA and debugging.</longdescription>
