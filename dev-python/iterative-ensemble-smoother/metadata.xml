Depending on your environment you will have to instructthe conan package manager about which c compiler to use.```bashc++ --version # to get information about which c compiler is installed              # on your system.pip install conan# The following sets the compiler settings# assuming the output of `c++ --version` indicated# that the installed c compiler was gcc version 11.2# and writes it to the default profile.conan profile update &quot;settings.compiler=gcc&quot; defaultconan profile update &quot;settings.compiler.version=11.2&quot; default```To build iterative_ensemble_smoother from source:```bashgit clone https://github.com/equinor/iterative_ensemble_smoother.gitcd iterative_ensemble_smootherpip install .```### build the documentation```bashapt install pandoc # Building the doc requires pandocpip install .[doc]spinx-build -c docs/source/ -b html docs/source/ docs/build/html/```</longdescription>
