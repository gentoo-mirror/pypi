	<longdescription>This is a Python package for manipulating 2-dimensional tabular datastructures (aka data frames). It is close in spirit to pandas or SFrame;however we put specific emphasis on speed and big data support. As thename suggests, the package is closely related to R's data.table andattempts to mimic its core algorithms and API.See https://github.com/h2oai/datatable for more details.</longdescription>
