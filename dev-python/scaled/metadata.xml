	<longdescription># ScaledThis project is aiming the target that provides very light, efficient, reliable way for distribute computingframework, like dask and ray, it uses centralized scheduler (like dask, unlike ray) and language agnostic protocolbetween client and scheduler, or between scheduler and worker.# IntroductionThe goal for this project should be as simple as possible- It built on top of zmq- it has ready python version of Client, Scheduler, Worker- I will provide golang or Rust version of Scheduler, the goal for the Scheduler should be completely computer language  agnostic, which means they follow the same protocol- Scheduler might support function based computing tree in the future# Installation`pip install scaled`if you want to use uvloop, please do: `pip install uvloop`, default we are using python builtin uvloop# How to use itThe use experience is very close to dask## Start local scheduler and cluster at the same time in the code```pythonimport randomfrom scaled import Clientfrom scaled import SchedulerClusterCombodef calculate(sec: int):    return sec * 1def main():    address = &quot;tcp://127.0.0.1:2345&quot;    cluster = SchedulerClusterCombo(address=address, n_workers=10, event_loop=&quot;uvloop&quot;)    client = Client(address=address)    tasks = [random.randint(0, 100) for _ in range(100000)]    futures = [client.submit(calculate, i) for i in tasks]    results = [future.result() for future in futures]    assert results == tasks    client.disconnect()    cluster.shutdown()if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    main()```## Start scheduler and cluster independentlyuse `scaled_scheduler` to start scheduler, for example:```bash$ scaled_scheduler tcp://0.0.0.0:8516[INFO]2023-03-19 12:16:10-0400: logging to ('/dev/stdout',)[INFO]2023-03-19 12:16:10-0400: use event loop: 2[INFO]2023-03-19 12:16:10-0400: Scheduler: monitor address is ipc:///tmp/0.0.0.0_8516_monitor[INFO]2023-03-19 12:16:10-0400: AsyncBinder: started[INFO]2023-03-19 12:16:10-0400: VanillaTaskManager: started[INFO]2023-03-19 12:16:10-0400: VanillaFunctionManager: started[INFO]2023-03-19 12:16:10-0400: VanillaWorkerManager: started[INFO]2023-03-19 12:16:10-0400: StatusReporter: started```use `scaled_cluster` to start 10 workers:```bash$ scaled_worker -n 10 tcp://127.0.0.1:8516[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: logging to ('/dev/stdout',)[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: ClusterProcess: starting 23 workers, heartbeat_interval_seconds=2, function_retention_seconds=3600[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[0] started[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[1] started[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[2] started[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[3] started[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[4] started[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[5] started[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[6] started[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[7] started[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[8] started[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[9] started```for detail options of above 2 program, please use argument `-h` to check out all available optionsThen you can write simply write client code as:```pythonfrom scaled import Clientdef foobar(foo: int):    return fooclient = Client(address=&quot;tcp://127.0.0.1:2345&quot;)future = client.submit(foobar, 1)print(future.result())```## SchedulerAs scaled_scheduler only need communicate with client and worker with protocol, so scaled_scheduler can be packaged anddistributed independently, unless protocol changes. It can be used for scheduling tasks that by other languageimplementations of client/worker too.Assume there is implementation of scaled protocol written in C++, has client and worker side, it can use python versionof scaled_scheduler for task scheduling and balancing### Scheduler BenchmarkInitially I was thinking to implement C++ or Rust version of scheduler that follows the protocol, but seems PyPy workspretty well, the scheduling overhead will be reduced by ~60%. Below is a simple benchmark chart, I used 100k noop tasksto just test how much overhead does scheduler will introduce**Note: as dask took 110 seconds to finish same amount of 100k noop tasks, I will not list it to below chart**| Python  | Version   | Event Loop | Time    ||---------|-----------|------------|---------|| CPython | 3.10      | asyncio    | 19.131s || CPython | 3.10      | uvloop     | 17.809s || CPython | 3.11.3    | asyncio    | 19.475s || CPython | 3.11.3    | uvloop     | 18.406s || PyPy    | 3.9.16    | asyncio    | 8.748s  || PyPy    | 3.9.16    | uvloop     | N/A     |* Test machine is AMD 5900X with 32gb RAM, started 10 workers### Package scheduler as one fileHere is how to use nuitka to compile package into one file (doesn't provide speedup):```shellnuitka3 --standalone --onefile --no-pyi-file --remove-output --include-package=uvloop --output-filename=scaled_scheduler ./run_scheduler.pynuitka3 --standalone --onefile --no-pyi-file --remove-output --output-filename=scaled_top ./run_top.py```Here is how to use pex to package into one file:```shellpex scaled -c scaled_scheduler -o scaled_schedulerpex scaled -c scaled_top -o scaled_top```## Graph TaskScaled also supports submit graph task, for example:```pythonfrom scaled import Clientdef inc(i):    return i + 1def add(a, b):    return a + bdef minus(a, b):    return a - bgraph = {    &quot;a&quot;: 2,    &quot;b&quot;: 2,    &quot;c&quot;: (inc, &quot;a&quot;),  # c = a + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3    &quot;d&quot;: (add, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;),  # d = a + b = 2 + 2 = 4    &quot;e&quot;: (minus, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)  # e = d - c = 4 - 3 = 1}client = Client(address=&quot;tcp://127.0.0.1:2345&quot;)print(client.get(graph, keys=[&quot;e&quot;]))```# Scaled TopYou can use `scaled_top` to connect to scheduler monitor address to get some insides of the scaled_top```bash$ scaled_top ipc:///tmp/0.0.0.0_8516_monitor```Which will something similar to top command, but it's for getting status of the scaled system:```bashscheduler       | task_manager        |     scheduler_sent        | scheduler_received      cpu  0.0% |   unassigned      0 |      HeartbeatEcho  1,593 |          Heartbeat  1,593      rss 35.4m |      running      0 |   FunctionResponse     12 |    FunctionRequest     12                |      success 10,000 |           TaskEcho 10,000 |               Task 10,000                |       failed      0 |               Task 10,000 |         TaskResult 10,000                |     canceled      0 |         TaskResult 10,000 |  DisconnectRequest     13                |    not_found      0 | DisconnectResponse     13 |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Shortcuts: worker[n] agt_cpu[C] agt_rss[M] cpu[c] rss[m] free[f] sent[w] queued[d] lag[l]Total 10 worker(s)                   worker agt_cpu agt_rss [cpu]   rss free sent queued   lag |    client_manager281379|desk-manjaro|e852+    0.0%   30.1m  0.5% 29.8m 1000    0      0 0.1ms |281386|desk-manjaro|f6fc+    0.0%   32.1m  0.5% 30.1m 1000    0      0 0.1ms | func_to_num_tasks281383|desk-manjaro|692a+    0.0%   30.1m  0.0% 29.9m 1000    0      0 0.2ms |281381|desk-manjaro|f415+    0.0%   30.0m  0.0% 30.0m 1000    0      0 0.1ms |281382|desk-manjaro|2d87+    0.0%   30.0m  0.0% 29.9m 1000    0      0 0.2ms |281387|desk-manjaro|9831+    0.0%   30.1m  0.0% 30.0m 1000    0      0 0.2ms |281380|desk-manjaro|9f8f+    0.0%   30.0m  0.0% 29.9m 1000    0      0 0.2ms |281378|desk-manjaro|1f49+    0.0%   30.0m  0.0% 29.8m 1000    0      0 0.1ms |281384|desk-manjaro|17b8+    0.0%   30.1m  0.0% 32.0m 1000    0      0 0.1ms |281385|desk-manjaro|5270+    0.0%   30.0m  0.0% 30.2m 1000    0      0 0.2ms |```- scheduler section is showing how much resources scheduler used- task_manager section shows count for each task status- scheduler_sent section shows count for each type of messages scheduler sent- scheduler_received section shows count for each type of messages scheduler received- function_id_to_tasks section shows task count for each function used- worker section shows worker details, you can use shortcuts to sort by columns, the char * on column header show which  column is sorted right now  - agt_cpu/agt_rss means cpu/memory usage of worker agent  - cpu/rss means cpu/memory usage of worker  - free means number of free task slots for this worker  - sent means how many tasks scheduler sent to the worker  - queued means how many tasks worker received and queued  - lag means the latency between worker and scheduler (round trip divided by 2), ms means microsecond</longdescription>
