	<longdescription>``addressable`` is a silly little utility that allows you to accessitems inside of a list using one or more indices as keys. You prettymuch get to pretend pretend that a list is a souped-up dictionary.::    artists = [{        'id': '0488',         'name': 'Lambchop',         'members': ['Kurt Wagner'],     }, {        'id': '9924',         'name': 'Dire Straits',         'members': ['Mark Knopfler'],     }]    # keys are matched against one or more indices    artists = List(artists, indices=('id', 'name'))    print artists['0488'] == artists['Lambchop']    # fuzzy matching    artists = List(artists, indices=('id', 'title'), fuzzy=True)    print artists['strait']    # extract the value, not the metadata    artists = List(artists, indices=('id', 'title'), facet='title')    print artists['9924'] == 'Dire Straits'So why would you want to do any of this? You probably don't.``addressable`` can be useful for certain DSL or library code where youwant to give the end users some freedom to code things their way, whenyou need to be able to very easily refer to certain things that areweirdly named or when there's multiple common ways of referring tosomething and you want the flexibility to mix-and-match.</longdescription>
