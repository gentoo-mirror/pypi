Args:        w: cp.Variable representing the portfolio weights.        risk_model: A risk model.    Returns:        A convex optimization problem.    &quot;&quot;&quot;    return cp.Problem(        cp.Minimize(risk_model.estimate(w, **kwargs)),        [cp.sum(w) == 1, w &gt;= 0] + risk_model.constraints(w, **kwargs)    )```The risk model is injected into the function.The function is not aware of the precise risk model used.All risk models are required to implement the `estimate` method.Note that factor risk models work with weights for the assets but also withweights for the factors.To stay flexible we are applying thiS `**kwargs` pattern to the function above.## A first exampleA first example is a risk model based on the sample covariance matrix.We construct the risk model as follows```pythonimport numpy as npimport cvxpy as cpfrom cvx.risk.sample import SampleCovarianceriskmodel = SampleCovariance(num=2)w = cp.Variable(2)problem = minimum_risk(w, riskmodel)riskmodel.update(cov=np.array([[1.0, 0.5], [0.5, 2.0]]))problem.solve()print(w.value)```The risk model and the actual optimization problem are decoupled.This is good practice and keeps the code clean and maintainable.In a backtest we don't have to reconstruct the problem in every iteration.We can simply update the risk model with the new data and solve the problemagain. The implementation of the risk models is flexible enough to deal withchanging dimensions of the underlying weight space.## Risk models### Sample covarianceWe offer a `SampleCovariance` class as seen above.### Factor risk modelsFactor risk models use the projection of the weight vector into a lowerdimensional subspace, e.g. each asset is the linear combination of $k$ factors.```mathr_i = \sum_{j=1}^k f_j \beta_{ji} + \epsilon_i```The factor time series are $f_1, \ldots, f_k$. The loadings are the coefficients$\beta_{ji}$.The residual returns $\epsilon_i$ are assumed to be uncorrelated with the factors.Any position $w$ in weight space projects to a position $y = \beta^T w$ infactor space. The variance for a position $w$ is the sum of the variance of thesystematic returns explained by the factors and the variance of theidiosyncratic returns.```mathVar(r) = Var(\beta^T w) + Var(\epsilon w)```We assume the residual returns are uncorrelated and hence```mathVar(r) = y^T \Sigma_f y + \sum_i w_i^2 Var(\epsilon_i)```where $\Sigma_f$ is the covariance matrix of the factors and $Var(\epsilon_i)$is the variance of the idiosyncratic returns.Factor risk models are widely used in practice. Usually two scenarios aredistinguished. A first route is to rely on estimates for the factor covariancematrix $\Sigma_f$, the loadings $\beta$ and the volatilities of theidiosyncratic returns $\epsilon_i$. Usually those quantities are provided byexternal parties, e.g. Barra or Axioma.An alternative would be to start with the estimation of factor time series$f_1, \ldots, f_k$.Usually they are estimated via a principal component analysis (PCA) of theasset returns.  It is then a simple linear regression to compute the loadings$\beta$. The volatilities of the idiosyncratic returns $\epsilon_i$ are computedas the standard deviation of the observed residuals.The factor covariance matrix $\Sigma_f$ may even be diagonal in this case as thefactors are orthogonal.We expose a method to compute the first $k$ principal components.### cvarWe currently also support the conditional value at risk (CVaR) as a riskmeasure.## PoetryWe assume you share already the love for [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org).Once you have installed poetry you can perform```bashmake install```to replicate the virtual environment we have defined in pyproject.toml.## KernelWe install [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org) within your new virtualenvironment. Executing```bashmake kernel```constructs a dedicated [Kernel](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/kernels.html)for the project.</longdescription>
