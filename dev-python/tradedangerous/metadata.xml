But it could take us days to reach some of them. So lets say we're currently at Kummer City in the Andere system.    trade.py run --from &quot;andere/kummer city&quot;        --credits 5000 --capacity 8 --ly-per 8.56 --jumps 2 --hops 2(The above represents a single line)That's a lot to type. TD is designed to support laziness when it comes to typing, so it allows for all kinds of short-cuts.    trade.py ru        --fr and/kumm     find a station matching 'kumm' in a                          system matching 'and'        --cr 5k           'k', 'm' and 'b' are recognized suffixes        --cap 8           8 units of cargo        --ly 8.56         maximum distance *per jump*        --ju 2            maximum 2 jumpsThe default for hops is 2, so I didn't have to include it.You can also use &quot;=&quot; to connect an option with its values:    trade.py ru --fr=and/kumm --cr=5k --cap=8 --ly=8.56 --ju=2With the data at the time I write this, this produces:    ANDERE/Kummer City -&gt; ANDERE/Malzberg Vision      ANDERE/Kummer City: 6 x Titanium, 2 x Polymers,      G 224-46/Lorrah Dock: 7 x Coltan, 1 x Lepidolite,      ANDERE/Malzberg Vision +8,032cr (502/ton)This tells us our overall route (line #1), what load to pick up from the first station, what to sell it for and pick up at the second stop and where to finish and unload for our final profit.Note that it could have just told us to pick up 6 Titanium (the max we could afford) or 8 Copper (the highest profit we could fill up with), Instead, TD crunched hard numbers and maximized the earnings of every cargo space AND credit.If you want to give Trade Dangerous a try, look no further than the [Setup Guide](https://github.com/eyeonus/Trade-Dangerous/wiki/Setup-Guide &quot;Setup Guide&quot;) and the [User Guide](https://github.com/eyeonus/Trade-Dangerous/wiki/User-Guide &quot;User Guide&quot;).Curious about programming with Trade Dangerous/Python?
