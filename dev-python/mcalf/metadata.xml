	<longdescription>===============================================MCALF: Multi-Component Atmospheric Line Fitting===============================================|Azure Pipelines Status| |Codecov| |PyPI Version| |Zenodo DOI| |Docs Status| |GitHub License|MCALF is an open-source Python package for accurately constraining velocityinformation from spectral imaging observations using machine learningtechniques.This software package is intended to be used by solar physicists tryingto extract line-of-sight (LOS) Doppler velocity information fromspectral imaging observations (Stokes I measurements) of the Sun.A ‘toolkit’ is provided that can be used to define a spectral modeloptimised for a particular dataset.This package is particularly suited for extracting velocity informationfrom spectral imaging observations where the individual spectra cancontain multiple spectral components.Such multiple components are typically present when active solar phenomenonoccur within an isolated region of the solar disk.Spectra within such a region will often have a large emission componentsuperimposed on top of the underlying absorption spectral profile from thequiescent solar atmosphere.A sample model is provided for an IBIS Ca II 8542 Å spectral imaging sunspotdataset.This dataset typically contains spectra with multiple atmosphericcomponents and this package supports the isolation of the individualcomponents such that velocity information can be constrained for eachcomponent.Using this sample model, as well as the separate base (template) model it isbuilt upon, a custom model can easily be built for a specific dataset.The custom model can be designed to take into account the spectral shape ofeach particular spectrum in the dataset.By training a neural network classifier using a sample of spectra from thedataset labelled with their spectral shapes, the spectral shape of anyspectrum in the dataset can be found.The fitting algorithm can then be adjusted for each spectrum based onthe particular spectral shape the neural network assigned it.This package is designed to run in parallel over large data cubes, as wellas in serial.As each spectrum is processed in isolation, this package scales very wellacross many processor cores.Numerous functions are provided to plot the results in a clearly.The MCALF API also contains many useful functions which have the potentialof being integrated into other Python packages.Installation------------For easier package management we recommend using `Miniconda`_ (or `Anaconda`_)and creating a `new conda environment`_ to install MCALF inside.To install MCALF using `Miniconda`_, run the following commands in yoursystem's command prompt, or if you are using Windows, in the'Anaconda Prompt':.. code:: bash    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge    $ conda config --set channel_priority strict    $ conda install mcalfMCALF is updated to the latest version by running:.. code:: bash    $ conda update mcalfAlternatively, you can install MCALF using ``pip``:.. code:: bash    $ pip install mcalfTesting-------A test suite is included with the package. The package is tested onmultiple platforms, however you may wish to run the tests on yoursystem also. More details on running our tox/pytest test suite areavailable in our `documentation`_.Getting Started---------------Documentation is `available here &lt;https://mcalf.macbride.me/&gt;`_.Some examples are included `here &lt;examples/&gt;`_.Contributing------------|Contributor Covenant|If you find this package useful and have time to make it even better,you are very welcome to contribute to this package, regardless of how muchprior experience you have.Types of ways you can contribute include, expanding the documentation withmore use cases and examples, reporting bugs through the GitHub issue tracker,reviewing pull requests and the existing code, fixing bugs and implementing newfeatures in the code.You are encouraged to submit any `bug reports`_ and `pull requests`_ directlyto the `GitHub repository`_.Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct.By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.Citation--------If you have used this package in work that leads to a publication, we wouldbe very grateful if you could acknowledge your use of this package in themain text of the publication.Please cite the following publications,    MacBride CD, Jess DB. 2021    MCALF: Multi-Component Atmospheric Line Fitting.    *Journal of Open Source Software*. **6(61)**, 3265.
