	<longdescription>Flake8 Mock plugin==================Remember that a mock's job is to say, &quot;You got it, boss&quot; whenever anyone callsit. It will do real work, like raising an exception, when one of itsconvenience methods is called, like ``assert_called_once_with``. But it won'tdo real work when you call a method that only *resembles* a convenience method,such as ``assert_called_once`` (no ``_with``!). Sometimes developers may notnotice that they are using a non-existent mock method, because they are notgetting an output error telling them so. And for some reason they can alsoforget to verify that the test cases fail before writing implementation code.This plugin checks for possible non-existent mock methods when you run``flake8``, the Python code checker.Inspired by http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2015/02/assert_called_once-threat-or-menace.html.Installation------------You can install or upgrade ``verve-flake8-mock`` with these commands::  $ pip install verve-flake8-mock  $ pip install --upgrade verve-flake8-mockPlugin for Flake8-----------------When both ``flake8 3.5.0`` and ``verve-flake8-mock`` are installed, the plugin isavailable in ``flake8``::    $ flake8 --version    3.5.0 (verve-flake8-mock: 0.4, pyflakes: 0.8.1)Example output--------------Once you run flake8, you can have something like::    $ flake8 test_file.py    test_file.py:55:5: M201 called_once is a non-existent mock property    test_file.py:56:5: M200 called_once_with is a non-existent mock methodCredits-------    * Alejandro Gabriel Pereira is the original author.    * Ania Warzecha has rewritten it for flake8 3 and with support for more methodsChanges-------0.4 (25-04-2019)````````````````* Forked by Verve to `verve-flake8-mock`* Added `has_calls` to checked methods* Added a check for not existent properties on mocks* Added compatibility for flake8 3.x* Added tests0.3 (09-10-2016)````````````````* Don't warn on `assert_not_called`, `assert_called` or `assert_called_once`.* Use ASCII only in README.rst0.2 (12-16-2015)````````````````* Add Python 3 compatibility.0.1 (10-20-2015)````````````````* First release.0.1dev0 (10-19-2015)````````````````````* First dev release.</longdescription>
