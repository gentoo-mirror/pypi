	<longdescription># PandemicAn agent model in which commuting, compliance, testing and contagion parameters driveinfection in a population of thousands of millions. Agents follow Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processesin the plane and collisions drive transmission. Results are stored at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.swarmprediction.com/about.html&quot;&gt;SwarmPrediction.com&lt;/a&gt; for further analysis, and can be retrieved by anyone.  ![](https://github.com/microprediction/pandemic/blob/master/images/pandemic.png)### Motivaton Covered in this [post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pandemic-minimalist-2d-ornstein-uhlenbeck-model-peter-cotton-phd) with the followup [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dear-new-zealand-heres-how-simulate-covid-19-all-your-cotton-phd/) where possibleimprovements are also discussed and acknowledgements are made. See also the SwarmPrediction.Com [list of articles](www.swarmprediction.com/articles.html). The author is not an epidemiologist. The model expresses no opinionson the health aspects of COVID-19. The model offers a novel motion model with some interestinganalytic properties also discussed in the [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dear-new-zealand-heres-how-simulate-covid-19-all-your-cotton-phd/) referencedabove and presented in a more technical [working paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/sgjvfxydcwpk) shared on Overleaf.### Basic Usage    pip install pandemic    &gt;&gt; from pandemic import run    &gt;&gt; run()See also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/microprediction/pandemic/tree/master/examples&quot;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; oflibrary use and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/microprediction/pandemic/tree/master/examples_of_surrogate_use&quot;&gt;examples of using the publicdatabase of simulations&lt;/a&gt; generated by this model. ### Other entry points. - pandemic.simulation.simulate is the main routine- pandemic.client offers an alternative in object oriented style ### ModifyingSee pandemic/client.py for examples of extending the newer style to include data storage, lockdown and so forth. #### DockerPandemic can be run in a docker container. ```docker run xtellurian/pandemic```### Crowd-sourced surrogate model See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.swarmprediction.com/about.html&quot;&gt;SwarmPrediction.com&lt;/a&gt; for an explanation of a SETI-like project to crowd-source a surrogate model. ### Basic elements of the model Covered in detail in this [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dear-new-zealand-heres-how-simulate-covid-19-all-your-cotton-phd/). As noted some analytical properties of special cases of the model are discussed in a [working paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/sgjvfxydcwpk). ### Contributing Opinions and issues are most welcome. </longdescription>
