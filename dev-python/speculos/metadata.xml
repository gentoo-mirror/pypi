More information canbe found here in the[documentation website](https://ledgerhq.github.io/speculos) (or in the[docs/ folder](docs/) directly).Usage example:```shell./speculos.py apps/btc.elf --model nanos# ... and open a browser on http://127.0.0.1:5000```## Bugs and contributionsFeel free to open issues and create pull requests on this GitHub repository.The `master` branch is protected to disable force pushing. Contributions shouldbe made through pull requests, which are reviewed by @LedgerHQ members beforebeing merged to `master`:- @LedgerHQ members can create branches directly on the repository (if member of  a team with write access to the repository)- External contributors should fork the repository## LimitationsThe emulator handles only a few syscalls made by common apps; for instance,syscalls related to app install, firmware update or OS info can't beimplemented.There is absolutely no guarantee that apps will have the same behavior onhardware devices and Speculos:- Invalid syscall parameters might throw an exception on a real device while  being ignored on Speculos.- Attempts to perform unaligned accesses when not allowed (eg. dereferencing a  misaligned pointer) will cause an alignment fault on a hardware device.## SecurityApps can make arbitrary Linux system calls (and use QEMU[semihosting](docs/user/semihosting.md) features), thus don't run Speculos onuntrusted apps.It's worth noting that the syscall implementation (`src/`) doesn't expectmalicious input. By the way, in Speculos, there is no privilege separationbetween the app and the syscalls. This doesn't reflect the security of thefirmware on hardware devices where app and OS isolation is enforced.Speculos is not part of Ledger bug bounty program.## Are you developing a Nano App as an external developer?For a smooth and quick integration:- Follow the developers documentation on the [Developer Portal](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/nano-app/introduction/) and - [Go on Discord](https://developers.ledger.com/discord-pro/) to chat with developer support and the developer community.</longdescription>
