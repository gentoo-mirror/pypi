	<longdescription>Motor-Types===========Python stubs for [Motor], a Non-Blocking [MongoDB] driver for [Python]'s [Tornado] and [AsyncIO] based applications.About------Stubs for [Motor] (version 3.0.0+) for substituting the missing type-hints. These stubs are meant to be used along withpycharm and mypy to facilitate static type-checking. Installing this package adds these `.pyi` files to`libs/site-packages/motor`. Currently, only the stubs for [AsyncIO] are supported. You can contribute to stubs for[Tornado] by opening a pull request for the same.**Note:** This project is currently under development and is in no way affiliated with MongoDB. This is an unofficialstub package.How to use?-----------You can either install from [PyPI] using [pip] or add files to your project directories manually.### Installing Using [pip]:```commandlinepip install motor-types```### To install [Motor] (and [Dnspython]) alongside the package:```commandlinepip install motor-types[motor]```### To add files to the project manually:Use this command to clone the repository:```commandlinegit clone &quot;https://github.com/L0RD-ZER0/Motor-Types&quot;```Afterwards, you can do either of the following to use stubs:* Copy the stubs manually to either ``libs/site-packages/motor`` or ``libs/site-packages/motor-stubs``, ideally the latter.* Add these stubs manually to project directories.  * [For MyPy][MyPy-Stubs].  * [For PyCharm][PyCharm-Stubs].  * For other static type-checking tools, consider referring to their corresponding documentation regarding stubs.Examples:---------### Auto-Complete Example**Without Stubs:**![ACNS]**With Stubs:**![ACWS]### Type-Checking Example**Without Stubs:**![TCNS]**With Stubs:**![TCWS]Dependencies------------This package uses following dependencies:* [Poetry] (For Packaging and Publishing)* [PyMongo] (For PyMongo related types)* [Motor] (For Referencing and for motor installation extra)* [Dnspython] (For motor installation extra)* [Pre-Commit] (For maintaining code quality)* [Typing-Extensions] (For using the latest typing features)How to Contribute?------------------The simplest contribution you can make is by opening a [GitHub Issue][GH-Issues] or by forking the repository and makinga pull request on the [GitHub Repository][GH-Repo] for the same. The changes can be as simple as improving thedocumentation or as big as completing any incomplete section of the typings.**Note:** All issues and pull-requests are subjected to a preliminary inspection.License-------This repository is licensed under MIT License.
