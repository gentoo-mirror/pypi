	<longdescription># AWS Cloudwatch Lightweight HandlerThis small log handler is designed to send events to AWS Cloudwatch. It is useful when operating infrastructure outside of the AWS Serverless Infrastructure (e.g. Lambdas or ECS). You can still integrate it in your Serverless Infrastructure, but you might find it easier to just let AWS Handle the logs in this cases.We originally developed this to be used on dedicated servers (on and off EC2) and chose to create something new because we wanted:* Provide your own AWS programmatic access credentials* Lightweight (only the handler is included and you need only one file)If you already have a codebase that is using python's logger, you only need minor modifications to send your logs to AWS. In fact, you only need to change code at the logger creation. If you havent done any logging before, I recommend you look at a basic tutorial on python's logging module. There are plenty of resources out there.# Installing itWe are on PyPi, so you can install via pip```bashpip install cloudwatch```Or if you prefer to customise and (hopefully) feedback on improvements and bugs```bashgit clone https://github.com/ernestomonroy/cloudwatch```# UsageThis module is designed to fit right into your existing logging code, so you only need to replace (or add) a handler and the same logger will send events to cloudwatch.```pythonimport logging#Create the loggerlogger = logging.getLogger('my_logger')#Create the formatterformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s - %(message)s')#Import cloudwath and create the new handlerfrom cloudwatch import cloudwatchhandler = cloudwatch.CloudwatchHandler(log_group = 'my_log_group')#Pass the formater to the handlerhandler.setFormatter(formatter)#Set the levellogger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)#Add the handler to the loggerlogger.addHandler(handler)#USE IT!logger.warning(&quot;Watch out! Something happened!&quot;)```## Specifying credentials and regionIf you dont add credentials when creating the handler, it uses the default AWS credentials that you set-up on the CLI, or that you passed on the invokation (if using on EC2, Lambda, ECS), this is in line with the boto3 configuration [Expained here](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html). However, you can also specify the credentials like this:```pythonhandler = cloudwatch.CloudwatchHandler( log_group = 'my_log_group', access_id = 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID',  access_key = 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')```Likewise, you can specify a region where the logger will be with the parameter: `region = 'us-east-1'`## Specifying log streamIf you dont add a log stream, the logger will create one for you with the timestamp and a random number. This is useful when you have multiple processes logging to the same log group without colliding. If you want, you can specify the log stream like this:```pythonhandler = cloudwatch.CloudwatchHandler( log_group = 'my_log_group', log_stream = 'my_log_stream')```## LegacyWe much prefer keyword arguments, and encourage you to use them. However, if you really want to avoid some typing, the order of the positional arguments work as follows:```pythonhandler = cloudwatch.CloudwatchHandler( 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', 'REGION', 'LOG_GROUP', 'LOG_STREAM')```# Parameters|Positional order|Keyword argument|Required|Default|Description||---|---|---|---|---||0|`access_id`|No|Taken from the AWS Configuration File or Role|The AWS Access Key ID that you want to use to interact with your AWS Account. Usually a 20 character alphanumeric.||1|`access_key`|No|Taken from the AWS Configuration File or Role|The corresponding AWS Secret to the above parameter||2|`region`|No|Taken from the AWS Configuration File or Role|The AWS Region name (e.g. `us-east-1`)||3|`log_group`|Yes||The name of the log group. If it already exists, it writes to it, otherwise it creates it.||4|`log_stream`|No|Datetime in the format `%Y%m%d%H%M%S%f` and 3 random digits|The name of the log stream. If it already exists, it writes to it, otherwise it creates it.|</longdescription>
