	<longdescription>sage_conf: Configuration module for the SageMath library (distributable version)================================================================================Description-----------This distribution package provides:- a single Python module, ``sage_conf``, providing configuration information  to the SageMath library at the time of its installation and at its runtime- a console script ``sage-config``, for querying the variables of ``sage_conf``  from the shell- a sourcable shell script ``sage-env-config``, providing additional configuration  information in the form of environment variablesThe ``sage_conf`` distribution package is polymorphic:  It has several implementations.sage_conf sdist on PyPI-----------------------This implementation of the ``sage_conf`` distribution package comes fromhttps://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/29039, which added the directory`pkgs/sage-conf_pypi &lt;https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/pkgs/sage-conf_pypi/&gt;`_.To install, use ``pip install -v sage_conf``.  Using ``-v`` ensures that diagnosticmessages are displayed.On installation (or building a wheel), it invokes ``sage_bootstrap`` to establisha build tree (``SAGE_ROOT``) and installation tree (``SAGE_LOCAL``) forthe SageMath distribution.  By default, it uses a subdirectory of ``$HOME/.sage``that is specific to the version of the distribution and the version of Python inuse.  If several virtual environments over the same version of Python install``sage_conf``, they will share these trees.After installation of ``sage_conf``, a wheelhouse containing wheels ofvarious libraries is available; type ``ls $(sage-configSAGE_SPKG_WHEELS)`` to list them and ``pip install $(sage-configSAGE_SPKG_WHEELS)/*.whl`` to install them.  After this, you can install the Sagelibrary, for example, using ``pip install sagemath-standard``.sage_conf wheels----------------Prebuilt binary wheels of the ``sage_conf`` distribution package are availableat https://github.com/sagemath/sage-wheels/releases/This implementation of ``sage_conf`` comes from https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31396,which adds the directory ``pkgs/sage-conf_relocatable/``.On building a wheel, it invokes ``sage_bootstrap`` to establish abuild and installation tree (``SAGE_ROOT``, ``SAGE_LOCAL``) in asubdirectory of the directory ``/var/tmp/``, whose name is specific tothe version of the distribution and the version of Python in use.The wheel distributes a copy of the prebuilt ``SAGE_ROOT`` and``SAGE_LOCAL``.  Importing ``sage_conf`` (or using the installed``sage-config`` script), makes sure that a symlink from the``/var/tmp`` location to the actual persistent installation locationis created.  As the relocated libraries and programs contain thehardcoded path ``SAGE_LOCAL`` in various ways (including as rpaths),this symlink is necessary for the prebuilt libraries and programs towork.``/var/tmp`` is a sticky directory on all Linux distributionsfollowing the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, as well as on macOS andon Cygwin.  On multi-user systems, only one user can use a givenversion of the distribution; other installation schemes are recommendedfor systems with multiple Sage users.sage_conf in the SageMath distribution--------------------------------------The original version of the distribution package ``sage_conf`` is usedinternally in the SageMath distribution.  It is provided in the directory`pkgs/sage-conf &lt;https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/pkgs/sage-conf/&gt;`_.This version of the package is generated by the Sage distribution's ``configure``script.sage_conf in downstream distributions-------------------------------------Downstream packagers and advanced developers and users may want to providetheir own implementation of the distribution package to support the intendeddeployment of the SageMath library.License-------GNU General Public License (GPL) v3 or laterUpstream Contact----------------https://www.sagemath.orgThis package is included in the source code of the Sage distribution,in `pkgs/sage-conf* &lt;https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/pkgs/&gt;`_.</longdescription>
