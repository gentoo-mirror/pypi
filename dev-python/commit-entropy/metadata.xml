	<longdescription>Commit Entropy==============Commit Entropy is a tool that can be used to calculate the entropy ofchanges in a source code repository. Entropy for code changes is ameasure of how specific each commit was in relation to the entire codebase. Very specific commits only affect a small set of files, and thushave a low entropy. Commits that touch a large number of files are muchless specific and have a higher entropy as a result.The term Entropy in this context is a simplified application of `ShannonEntropy &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29&gt;`__to commits in a source repository. It's simplified since we only look atthe number of files changed each commit, with each file having an equalprobability.Read more about entropy on our`blog &lt;http://grip.qa/blog/entropy-measuring-software-maturity/&gt;`__.Installation------------Commit Entropy currently supports `Python3.x &lt;https://www.python.org/downloads/&gt;`__. It can be installed using`pip &lt;https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/&gt;`__.::    pip install commit-entropyThis will install the ``commit-entropy`` executable on your path.If you don't have pip, you can install it manually by cloning the codeand running the install script:::    git clone git@github.com:GripQA/commit-entropy.git    cd commit-entropy    python setup.py installUsage-----Currently we support a single operation: exporting a csv file with theaverage entropy per day and a 30-day rolling average. From within a gitrepo:::    commit-entropy csvThis will output a ``entropy.csv`` file in the current directory withthe average entropy values.You can ignore a list of paths by using the ``--ignore`` option:::    commit-entropy csv --ignore=vendor/*,*.logSupport-------If you have any questions, problems, or suggestions, please submit an`issue &lt;../../issues&gt;`__ or contact us at support@grip.qa.</longdescription>
