Thenyou can create scan tasks to use both scanners.## Installation### RequirementsPython 3.7 and later is supported.`ospd-openvas` has dependencies on the following Python packages:- `defusedxml`- `depreacted`- `lxml`- `packaging`- `paho-mqtt`- `psutil`- `python-gnupg`- `redis`### Mandatory configurationThe `ospd-openvas` startup parameter `--lock-file-dir` or the `lock_file_dir` configparameter of the `ospd.conf` config file needs to point to the same location / path ofthe `gvmd` daemon and the `openvas` command line tool (Default: `&lt;install-prefix&gt;/var/run`).Examples for both are shipped within the `config` sub-folder of this project.Also in order to be able to use Notus ospd-openvas must connect to a MQTT broker, such as [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) in order to communicate. With the parameter `--mqtt-broker-address` (Default: localhost) the correct address must be given as well as the corresponding port with `--mqtt-broker-port` (Default: 1883).Please see the `Details` section of the [GVM release notes](https://community.greenbone.net/t/gvm-20-08-stable-initial-release-2020-08-12/6312)for more details.### Optional configurationPlease note that although you can run `openvas` (launched from an `ospd-openvas`process) as a user without elevated privileges, it is recommended that you start`openvas` as `root` since a number of Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs) requireroot privileges to perform certain operations like packet forgery. If you run`openvas` as a user without permission to perform these operations, your scanresults are likely to be incomplete.As `openvas` will be launched from an `ospd-openvas` process with sudo,the next configuration is required in the sudoers file:    sudo visudoadd this line to allow the user running `ospd-openvas`, to launch `openvas`with root permissions    &lt;user&gt; ALL = NOPASSWD: &lt;install prefix&gt;/sbin/openvasIf you set an install prefix, you have to update the path in the sudoersfile too:    Defaults        secure_path=&lt;existing paths...&gt;:&lt;install prefix&gt;/sbin## UsageThere are no special usage aspects for this module beyond the generic usageguide.Please follow the general usage guide for ospd-based scanners:  &lt;https://github.com/greenbone/ospd-openvas/blob/main/docs/USAGE-ospd-scanner.md&gt;## SupportFor any question on the usage of ospd-openvas please use the [GreenboneCommunity Portal](https://community.greenbone.net/). If you found a problemwith the software, please [create anissue](https://github.com/greenbone/ospd-openvas/issues) on GitHub. If you are aGreenbone customer you may alternatively or additionally forward your issue tothe Greenbone Support Portal.## MaintainerThis project is maintained by [Greenbone NetworksGmbH](https://www.greenbone.net/).## ContributingYour contributions are highly appreciated. Please [create a pullrequest](https://github.com/greenbone/ospd-openvas/pulls) on GitHub. Biggerchanges need to be discussed with the development team via the [issues sectionat GitHub](https://github.com/greenbone/ospd-openvas/issues) first.For development you should use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org)to keep your python packages separated in different environments. First installpoetry via pip    python3 -m pip install --user poetryAfterwards run    poetry installin the checkout directory of ospd-openvas (the directory containing the`pyproject.toml` file) to install all dependencies including the packages onlyrequired for development.The ospd-openvas repository uses [autohooks](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks)to apply linting and auto formatting via git hooks. Please ensure the git hooksare active.    poetry install    poetry run autohooks activate --force## LicenseCopyright (C) 2018-2022 [Greenbone AG](https://www.greenbone.net/)Licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later](COPYING).</longdescription>
