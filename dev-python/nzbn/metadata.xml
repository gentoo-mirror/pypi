	<longdescription># New Zealand Business Number Python LibraryA Python library for interacting with New Zealand Business Number (NZBN)services provided by the New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation, andEmployment (MBIE).## Installation```$ pip install nzbn```## NomenclatureThe MBIE NZBN API has two main &quot;Entity&quot; types, where &quot;Entity&quot; is used to referto a legal person recorded in the New Zealand Business Register (NZBR). Thefirs is included in vector results from search queries, and is called`SearchEntity`. The second is returned in response to requests for a specificNBZN, and is called `FullEntity`.The authors of this library find referring to these as `AbbreviatedEntity`and `Entity` to be more natural, and therefore those names are used. You canalso use `SearchEntity` and `FullEntity` in your Python code, as those namesare effectively type-aliases for `AbbreviatedEntity` and `Entity`.## Example Usage### Get a list of abbreviated entities```pythonfrom nzbn import AbbreviatedEntityentities: List[AbbreviatedEntity] = AbbreviatedEntity.retrieve_many(    api_key=&quot;your nzbn API access token&quot;,    search_text=&quot;some entity name&quot;,    page=0,    # defaults to 0    limit=20   # per page count, defaults to 20)```### Get detailed data about an entity```pythonfrom nzbn import Entityentity: Optional[Entity] = Entity.retrieve(    api_key=&quot;your nzbn API access token&quot;,    nzbn=&quot;9429049541410&quot;,    sandbox=False  # defaults to False)```</longdescription>
