After Notebook v7.0 is released, we will no longer maintain Notebook v5. All Notebook v5 users are strongly advised to upgrade to Classic Notebook v6 as soon as possible.The Jupyter Notebook project is currently undertaking a transition to a more modern code base built from the ground-up using JupyterLab components and extensions.There is new stream of work which was submitted and then accepted as a Jupyter Enhancement Proposal (JEP) as part of the next version (v7): https://jupyter.org/enhancement-proposals/79-notebook-v7/notebook-v7.htmlThere is also a plan to continue maintaining Notebook v6 with bug and security fixes only, to ease the transition to Notebook v7: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook-team-compass/issues/5#issuecomment-1085254000### Notebook v7The next major version of Notebook will be based on:- JupyterLab components for the frontend- Jupyter Server for the Python serverThis represents a significant change to the `jupyter/notebook` code base.To learn more about Notebook v7: https://jupyter.org/enhancement-proposals/79-notebook-v7/notebook-v7.html### Classic Notebook v6Maintainance and security-related issues are now being addressed in the [`6.4.x`](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/tree/6.4.x) branch.A `6.5.x` branch will be soon created and will depend on [`nbclassic`](https://github.com/jupyter/nbclassic) for the HTML/JavaScript/CSS assets.New features and continuous improvement is now focused on Notebook v7 (see section above).If you have an open pull request with a new feature or if you were planning to open one, we encourage switching over to the Jupyter Server and JupyterLab architecture, and distribute it as a server extension and / or JupyterLab prebuilt extension. That way your new feature will also be compatible with the new Notebook v7.## Jupyter notebook, the language-agnostic evolution of IPython notebookJupyter notebook is a language-agnostic HTML notebook application forProject Jupyter. In 2015, Jupyter notebook was released as a part ofThe Big Split™ of the IPython codebase. IPython 3 was the last major monolithicrelease containing both language-agnostic code, such as the _IPython notebook_,and language specific code, such as the _IPython kernel for Python_. Ascomputing spans across many languages, Project Jupyter will continue to develop thelanguage-agnostic **Jupyter notebook** in this repo and with the help of thecommunity develop language specific kernels which are found in their owndiscrete repos.- [The Big Split™ announcement](https://blog.jupyter.org/the-big-split-9d7b88a031a7)- [Jupyter Ascending blog post](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-ascending-1bf5b362d97e)## InstallationYou can find the installation documentation for the[Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).The documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found[here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).For a local installation, make sure you have[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:```bashpip install notebook```## Usage - Running Jupyter notebook### Running in a local installationLaunch with:```bashjupyter notebook```### Running in a remote installationYou need some configuration before starting Jupyter notebook remotely. See [Running a notebook server](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html).## Development InstallationSee [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to set up a local development installation.## ContributingIf you are interested in contributing to the project, see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).## Community Guidelines and Code of ConductThis repository is a Jupyter project and follows the Jupyter[Community Guides and Code of Conduct](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html).## Resources- [Project Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org)- [Online Demo at jupyter.org/try](https://jupyter.org/try)- [Documentation for Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)- [Korean Version of Installation](https://github.com/ChungJooHo/Jupyter_Kor_doc/)- [Documentation for Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) \[[PDF](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/jupyter/latest/jupyter.pdf)\]- [Issues](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues)- [Technical support - Jupyter Google Group](https://discourse.jupyter.org/)## About the Jupyter Development TeamThe Jupyter Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Jupyter project.This includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:https://github.com/jupyter/.## Our Copyright PolicyJupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyrightover their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that thesecontributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupytersource code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person orinstitution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire JupyterDevelopment Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of whatchanges/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicatetheir copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit thechange to one of the Jupyter repositories.With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code fileto indicate the copyright and license terms:```# Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team.# Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.```</longdescription>
