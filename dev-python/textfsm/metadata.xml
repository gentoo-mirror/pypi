	<longdescription>TextFSM=======Python module which implements a template based state machine for parsingsemi-formatted text. Originally developed to allow programmatic access toinformation returned from the command line interface (CLI) of networkingdevices.The engine takes two inputs - a template file, and text input (such as commandresponses from the CLI of a device) and returns a list of records that containsthe data parsed from the text.A template file is needed for each uniquely structured text input. Some examplesare provided with the code and users are encouraged to develop their own.By developing a pool of template files, scripts can call TextFSM to parse usefulinformation from a variety of sources. It is also possible to use differenttemplates on the same data in order to create different tables (or views).TextFSM was developed internally at Google and released under the Apache 2.0licence for the benefit of the wider community.[**See documentation for more details.**](https://github.com/google/textfsm/wiki/TextFSM)Before contributing-------------------If you are not a Google employee, our lawyers insist that you sign a ContributorLicence Agreement (CLA).If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you ownthe intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an[individual CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual).Individual CLAs can be signed electronically.
