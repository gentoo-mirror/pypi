About Kiwi ---------- Chris Colbert began the Kiwi project in December 2013 in an effort to create a blisteringly fast UI constraint solver. Chris is still the project lead. The Nucleic Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Nucleic project and its subprojects. The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: http://github.com/nucleic.
