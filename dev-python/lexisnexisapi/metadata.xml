	<longdescription>#lexisnexisapi##About lexisnexisapi:lexisnexisapi is a module designed to work with certain LexisNexis DAAS APIs.  Currently, this module only works with the Metabase API, and requires a Metabase API key.the Metabase module within lexisnexisapi creates an instance of the MbSearch class based on a query provided by the end user.  It takes the JSON response from the Metabase API and places it within a Python class.  It is also possible to create an instance of a class for a specific article, to simplify further analysis.This class can retrieve dataframes, index terms, or any otherattributes retrieved from the API HTTP response.The lexisnexisapi is a work in progress... and may not be regularly maintained. ##RequirementsBeyond system requirements, lexisnexisapi requires an active Metabase API key.#Required modules##Configuration##Troubleshooting &amp; FAQ lexisnexisapi has limited built-in error handling and should be considered a beta module.  Thereis no guarantee that lexisnexisapi will work in all environments.##MaintainersThis module is not regularly maintained.  It was written and is updated by thecustomer service integration specialist within the DAAS customer success team at LexisNexis.
