	<longdescription># cassIOA framework-agnostic Python library to seamlessly integrate Apache Cassandra with ML/LLM/genAI workloads.**Note**: this is currently an alpha release.## UsersInstallation is as simple as:```pip install cassio```For example usages and integration with higher-level LLM frameworkssuch as LangChain, please visit [cassio.org](https://cassio.org).## CassIO developers### SetupTo develop `cassio`, use the `requirements-dev.txt`.To use the dev version in an integration (e.g. your branch of LangChain),`pip install -e .` in this `cassio` repo from within the virtual environmentyou are using to develop your integration.### Git flow_Note: this is a rough guide, use your common sense and consider exceptions._`main` is where versioned releases occur (the corresponding commits are git-taggedas `v0.0.7` and similar, parallel to the PyPI releases).Please do not push/PR more than trivial fixes directly to `main`.Features should generally be done on specific branches and merged into `dev`for wider testing. Then, with a slower cadence (such as, when releasing),`dev` would be merged to `main`.![Git flow](images/git-flow.png)#### VersioningWe are still at `0.*`. Occasional breaking changes are to be expected,but please think carefully. A later stronger model of versioning willbe adopted.### StyleWe are trying to land on a strictly enforced style. Currently,the following directories are kept in check this way:- `src/cassio/table`- `src/cassio/vector`- `src/cassio/utils`- `tests`- `src/cassio/keyvalue`- `src/cassio/history`This means we try to get clean output from the followingin each of these directories (up to your good will for the time being):```black .ruff .mypy .```### Python version coverageAt the moment we try to run tests under Python3.8 and Python3.10 to try andcatch versions-specific issues(such as the newer `typing` syntax such as `typeA | typeB`, illegal on 3.8).### Publishing- Bump version in setup.py- Add to `CHANGES.txt`- Commit the very code that will be built:```rm upload dist/*python setup.py sdist bdist_wheeltwine upload dist/*# (login to PyPI ...)```### TestingPlease run tests (and add some coverage for new features). This is notenforced other than to your conscience.#### Unit testingYou need a virtualenv with the `requirements-dev.txt` installed.```pytest tests/unit```#### Integration with the DBYou need a virtualenv with the `requirements-dev.txt` installed.Create the DB connection settings file, `cp TEMPLATE.testing.env .testing.env`and then edit the properties. You need at least one of either Astra DB or aCassandra cluster to use, with vector-search support.Source with `. .testing.env`.Launch the tests with```pytest tests/integration```(you can specify `TEST_DB_MODE` in the env file or override it by prependingthe above command with `TEST_DB_MODE=LOCAL_CASSANDRA` or `ASTRA_DB` foreasy switching).</longdescription>
