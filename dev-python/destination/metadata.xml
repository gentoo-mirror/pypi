Hence, you should deepcopyinstances or add a mutex lock before using dispatchers and rules in theother threads.Usage=====The default implementation of url parsing uses regular expressions. This issimilar to Django and Tornado. You can create rules and dispatchers toresolve and parse your url using regular expressions set in the rules.Generally, you should start with :code:`ReRule` and:code:`Dispatcher`. You can create a :code:`ReRule` with the regular expressionthat is going to be used to parse (and possibly compose) the url, and anoptional identifier to help you identify which rule is parsed, if an identifieris not provided or its value is set to :code:`None`, the rule itself will beused as an identifier. A :code:`Dispatcher` may be instantiated with noarguments as a storage of multiple rules. You can add or remove rules atany time.:code:`ReSubDispatcher` is a sub-dispatcher that can be added to a dispatcheras a rule. It uses regular expressions to chop off the part matched to theregular expression and dispatches the rest part to the rules added to it.:code:`BaseRule` and :code:`BaseDispatcher` can be used to create custom rulesand dispatchers.Licence=======MIT LicenseCopyright (c) 2021 Kaede HoshikawaPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
