	<longdescription># Brightway2 speedupsA series of function written in [Cython](http://cython.org/) that speed up critical functions to improve the overall performance of the [Brightway2 life cycle assessment framework](https://brightwaylca.org).In order to avoid having to have Cython as a dependency, this library includes both the `pyx` and Cython-generated `c` code, and is distributed as pre-compiled [wheels](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel), except on Linux where access to a `C` compiler is assumed.## Building `C` files    cython -t bw2speedups/_consolidate.pyx bw2speedups/_indexer.pyx bw2speedups/_find_first.pyx## Building shared librariesAlthough you can do this inplace, in my experience it is easier to just install the library in a temporary environment. You don't want to deal with `.so` files in the source repository.## TestingInstall the library into a temporary environment, then manually run the separate test files, i.e. `python bw2speedupds/test/test_consolidate.py`. This isn't the most elegant, but it will do for now.## Building wheels    pip install wheel    python setup.py bdist_wheelNote that this has to be done separately for each OS and environment, i.e. Windows 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Python are separate wheels, even with the same version of Windows.</longdescription>
