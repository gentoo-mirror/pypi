If you somehow manage to download too frequently (eg: by using `cvd clean all` and `cvd update` repeatedly), then the official database server may refuse your download request, and one or more databases may go on cool-down until it's safe to try again.## Requirements- Python 3.6 or newer.- An internet connection with DNS enabled.- The following Python packages.  These will be installed automatically if you use `pip`, but may need to be installed manually otherwise:  - `click` v7.0 or newer  - `coloredlogs` v10.0 or newer  - `colorama`  - `requests`  - `dnspython` v2.1.0 or newer  - `rangehttpserver`## InstallationYou may install `cvdupdate` from PyPI using `pip`, or you may clone the project Git repository and use `pip` to install it locally.Install `cvdupdate` from PyPI:```bashpython3 -m pip install --user cvdupdate```## Basic UsageUse the `--help` option with any `cvd` command to get help.```bashcvd --help```&gt; _Tip_: You may not be able to run the `cvd` or `cvdupdate` shortcut directly if your Python Scripts directory is not in your `PATH` environment variable. If you run into this issue, and do not wish to add the Python Scripts directory to your path, you can run CVD-Update like this:&gt;&gt; ```bash&gt; python -m cvdupdate --help&gt; ```(optional) You may wish to customize where the databases are stored:```bashcvd config set --dbdir &lt;your www path&gt;```Run this to download the latest database and associated CDIFF patch files:```bashcvd update```Downloaded databases will be placed in `~/.cvdupdate/database` unless you customized it to use a different directory.Newly downloaded databases will replace the previous database version, but the CDIFF patch files will accumulate up to a configured maximum before it starts deleting old CDIFFs (default: 30 CDIFFs). You can configure it to keep more CDIFFs by manually editing the config (default: `~/.cvdupdate/config.json`). The same behavior applies for CVD-Update log rotation.Run this to serve up the database directory on `http://localhost:8000` so you can test it with FreshClam.```bashcvd serve```&gt; _Disclaimer_: The `cvd serve` feature is not intended for production use, just for testing. You probably want to use a more robust HTTP server for production work.Install ClamAV if you don't already have it and, in another terminal window, modify your `freshclam.conf` file. Replace:```DatabaseMirror database.clamav.net```... with:```DatabaseMirror http://localhost:8000```&gt; _Tip_: A default install on Linux/Unix places `freshclam.conf` in `/usr/local/etc/freshclam.conf`. If one does not exist, you may need to create it using `freshclam.conf.sample` as a template.Now, run `freshclam -v` or `freshclam.exe -v` to see what happens. You should see FreshClam successfully update it's own database directory from your private database server.Run `cvd update` as often as you need.  Maybe put it in a `cron` job.&gt; _Tip_: Each command supports a `--verbose` (`-V`) mode, which often provides more details about what's going on under the hood.### Cron ExampleCron is a popular choice to automate frequent tasks on Linux / Unix systems.1. Open a terminal running as the user which you want CVD-Update to run under, do the following:   ```bash   crontab -e   ```2. Press `i` to insert new text, and add this line:   ```bash   30 */4 * * * /bin/sh -c &quot;~/.local/bin/cvd update &amp;&gt; /dev/null&quot;   ```   Or instead of `~/`, you can do this, replacing `username` with your user name:   ```bash   30 */4 * * * /bin/sh -c &quot;/home/username/.local/bin/cvd update &amp;&gt; /dev/null&quot;   ```3. Press &lt;Escape&gt;, then type `:wq` and press &lt;Enter&gt; to write the file to disk and quit.**About these settings**:I selected `30 */4 * * *` to run at minute 30 past every 4th hour. CVD-Update uses a DNS check to do version checks before it attempts to download any files, just like FreshClam. Running CVD-Update more than once a day should not be an issue.CVD-Update will write logs to the `~/.cvdupdate/logs` directory, which is why I directed `stdout` and `stderr` to `/dev/null` instead of a log file. You can use the `cvd config set` command to customize the log directory if you like, or redirect `stdout` and `stderr` to a log file if you prefer everything in one log instead of separate daily logs.## Optional Functionality### Using a custom DNS serverDNS is required for CVD-Update to function properly (to gather the TXT record containing the current definition database version). You can select a specific nameserver to ensure said nameserver is used when querying the TXT record containing the current database definition version available1. Set the nameserver in the config. Eg:   ```bash   cvd config set --nameserver 208.67.222.222   ```2. Set the environment variable `CVDUPDATE_NAMESERVER`. Eg:   ```bash   CVDUPDATE_NAMESERVER=&quot;208.67.222.222&quot; cvd update   ```The environment variable will take precedence over the nameserver config setting.Note:  Both options can be used to provide a comma-delimited list of nameservers to utilize for resolution.### Using a proxyDepending on your type of proxy, you may be able to use CVD-Update with your proxy by running CVD-Update like this:First, set a custom domain name server to use the proxy:```bashcvd config set --nameserver &lt;proxy_ip&gt;```Then run CVD-Update like this:```bashhttp_proxy=http://&lt;proxy_ip&gt;:&lt;proxy_port&gt; https_proxy=http://&lt;proxy_ip&gt;:&lt;proxy_port&gt; cvd update -V```Or create a script to wrap the CVD-Update call. Something like:```bash#!/bin/bashhttp_proxy=http://&lt;proxy_ip&gt;:&lt;proxy_port&gt;export http_proxyhttps_proxy=http://&lt;proxy_ip&gt;:&lt;proxy_port&gt;export https_proxycvd update -V```&gt; _Disclaimer_: CVD-Update doesn't support proxies that require authentication at this time. If your network admin allows it, you may be able to work around it by updating your proxy to allow HTTP requests through unauthenticated if the User-Agent matches your specific CVD-Update user agent. The CVD-Update User-Agent follows the form `CVDUPDATE/&lt;version&gt; (&lt;uuid&gt;)` where the `uuid` is unique to your installation and can be found in the `~/.cvdupdate/state.json` file (or `~/.cvdupdate/config.json` for cvdupdate &lt;=1.0.2). See https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/cvdupdate/issues/9 for more details.&gt;&gt; Adding support for proxy authentication is a ripe opportunity for a community contribution to the project.## Files and directories created by CVD-UpdateThis tool is to creates the following directories: - `~/.cvdupdate` - `~/.cvdupdate/logs` - `~/.cvdupdate/databases`This tool creates the following files: - `~/.cvdupdate/config.json` - `~/.cvdupdate/state.json` - `~/.cvdupdate/databases/&lt;database&gt;.cvd` - `~/.cvdupdate/databases/&lt;database&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.cdiff` - `~/.cvdupdate/logs/&lt;date&gt;.log`&gt; _Tip_: You can set custom `database` and `logs` directories with the `cvd config set` command. It is likely you will want to customize the `database` directory to point to your HTTP server's `www` directory (or equivalent). Bare in mind that if you already downloaded the databases to the old directory, you may want to move them to the new directory.&gt; _Important_: If you want to use a custom config path, you'll have to use it in every command. If you're fine with having it go in `~/.cvdupdate/config.json`, don't worry about it.## Additional Usage### Get familiar with the toolFamiliarize yourself with the various commands using the `--help` option.```bashcvd --helpcvd config --helpcvd update --helpcvd clean --help```Print out the current list of databases.```bashcvd list -V```Print out the config to see what it looks like.```bashcvd config show```### Do an updateDo an update, use &quot;verbose mode&quot; to so you can get a feel for how it works.```bashcvd update -V```List out the databases again:```bashcvd list -V```The print out the config again so you can see what's changed.```bashcvd config show```And maybe take a peek in the database directory as well to see it for yourself.```bashls ~/.cvdupdate/database```Have a look at the logs if you wish.```bashls ~/.cvdupdate/logscat ~/.cvdupdate/logs/*```### Serve it up, Test out FreshClamTest out your mirror with FreshClam on the same computer.This tool includes a `--serve` feature that will host the current database directory on http://localhost (default port: 8000).You can test it by running `freshclam` or `freshclam.exe` locally, where you've configured `freshclam.conf` with:```DatabaseMirror http://localhost:8000```## ContributeWe'd love your help.
