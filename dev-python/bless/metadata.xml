This is particularly useful when prototyping and testingservers on different devices with the goal of ensuring that expected behaviormatches across all systems.Bless's code roughly follows a similar style to[Bleak](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak) in order to ease development of clientand server programs.# Installation```bashpip install bless```# FeaturesBless enables reading, writing, and notifying of BLE characteristic values.Developers can provide callback functions to manipulate data that is sent outfor reading or delivered for writing prior to processing the underlyingcommands.# ExamplesSee example code for setting up a BLE server where read and writecharacteristic can be be probed by BLE clients (central devices)[Basic ServerExample](https://github.com/kevincar/bless/blob/master/examples/server.py)[GATT Tree ServerExample](https://github.com/kevincar/bless/blob/master/examples/gattserver.py)</longdescription>
