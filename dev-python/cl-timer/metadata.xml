	<longdescription># CL Timer*A cubing timer for the terminal*Installation instructions and command documentation: https://lol-cubes.github.io/cl-timerpypi: https://pypi.org/project/cl-timer## ContributionFeel free to submit pull requests.## System Requirements and DependenciesThis currently only works on macOS, though once a level of functionality on par with popular web-based timers such as cs-timer or qq-timer (the latter likely more feasible) is reached, I will consider working first on ubuntu support, and later windows.Once that aforementioned work is done on adapting this to other OSes, I will have exact instructions on how to make this work on each system.As of right now, any modern version of python3 should be good for this, but it is being developed on python3.8.0, so I may use some features that will throw syntax errors in any older versions.</longdescription>
