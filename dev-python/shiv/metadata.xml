Getting bootstrapped to develop is easy:```shgit clone git@github.com:linkedin/shiv.gitcd shivpython3 -m venv venvsource ./venv/bin/activatepython3 -m pip install --upgrade buildpython3 -m buildpython3 -m pip install -e .```Don't forget to run and write tests:```shpython3 -m pip install toxtox```To build documentation when you changed something in `docs`:```shpython3 -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txtsphinx-build docs build/html```### gotchasZipapps created with shiv are not guaranteed to be cross-compatible with other architectures. For example, a `pyz` file built on a Mac may only work on other Macs, likewise for RHEL, etc. This usually only applies to zipapps that have C extensions in their dependencies. If all your dependencies are pure python, then chances are the `pyz` _will_ work on other platforms. Just something to be aware of.Zipapps created with shiv *will* extract themselves into `~/.shiv`, unless overridden via`SHIV_ROOT`. If you create many utilities with shiv, you may want to occasionally clean thisdirectory.---### acknowledgementsSimilar projects:* [PEX](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex)* [pyzzer](https://pypi.org/project/pyzzer/#description)* [superzippy](https://github.com/brownhead/superzippy)Logo by Juliette Carvalho</longdescription>
