An example configuration file is shown below:```ini[shippy]server = https://example.comtoken = a1b2c3d4e5...DisableBuildOnUpload = falseUploadWithoutPrompt = false```Configuration options explained:### `server`Server URL### `token`Token used to sign in to the server### `DisableBuildOnUpload`Immediately disables the build after uploading it. Useful if you are uploading from Jenkins or uploading potentiallyunstable builds. Do NOT use under normal circumstances!### `UploadWithoutPrompt`shippy will not prompt you before uploading builds, and will automatically upload all builds found in the currentdirectory. Use with caution. Same as the `-y`/`--yes` flag shown above.</longdescription>
