	<longdescription>========PYATOMDB========This code is designed to interact with the AtomDB database. It is in activedevelopment but is now approaching feature complete for creating spectraand interacting with fitting codes like XSPEC and Sherpa.Full documentation can be found at http://atomdb.readthedocs.io============Installation============Standard python installation. #. From `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/&gt;`_ , using the simple ``pip install pyatomdb`` command.#. From `GitHub &lt;https://github.com/AtomDB/pyatomdb&gt;`_ , using the command ``git clone https://github.com/AtomDB/pyatomdb.git`` to get the source, then ``pip install -e python &lt;/path/to/folder/with/setup.py/in/it&gt;``.#. If using ``Conda``: Pyatomdb is not packaged with Conda as it requires compiling of some C code and (as far as I can tell) Conda cannot handle this. I recommend installing the dependencies independently, e.g.: ``conda install requests wget &quot;numpy&gt;=1.9.0&quot; &quot;scipy&gt;=1.9.0&quot; joblib mock astropy pycurl``, then install pip within conda (``conda install pip``), and then ``pip install -e python &lt;/path/to/folder/with/setup.py/in/it&gt;``.#. Using ``setuptools`` (deprecated): python setup.py install===============Version History===============0.0.0.1July 17th 2015: initial release0.0.0.2July 21st 2015: added ``dummyfirst`` keyword to``pyatomdb.spectrum.make_spectrum``0.0.0.3August 12th 2015: fixed some errors in spectrum.py.

Converted all 'z0' to 'Z' and 'rmJ' to 'z1' throught the code for consistency.0.0.1.1September 25th 2015:   Major documentation revamp.Separated datacache from settings keywordIntroduced automatic install and update into util package.0.0.1.2October 13th 2015:   More documentation improvementsRemoved use of &quot;curl&quot; library, as apparently is non-standard. Replaced with wget, ftplib and requests.0.0.1.3November 5th 2015: Many minor bugfixes. Added &quot;switch_version&quot; to util packageto allow looking at older AtomDB version data. Added use option to get total RRCemission using integral to infinity. 0.0.1.5February 12th 2016: As ever, bugfixes. Also added ability to calculateionization balance to apec module.0.0.1.6April 22nd 2016: Bugfixes! Also:Major change to get_maxwell_rate interfaceAdded ability to apply RMF and ARF to spectra in spectrum moduleFixed hydrogenic RRC calculation0.0.1.7May 23rd 2016: Bugfix:update switch_version to get NEI files too.0.0.1.8October 07th 2016: Bugfixes! Also:APEC now included in apec.py. Can create a full apec run from a par file.0.0.1.9October 13th 2016: Bugfixes! wget was causing problems during file download due to bugs, Now fixed0.0.2.0November 01st 2016: Removed use of sparse algebra. Wasn't accurate enough, causing issues with suprious lines in low ionization states.Implemented faster ionization balance calculations in &quot;apec.solve_ionbal_eigen&quot;0.0.2.1November 16th 2016: Bugfix to the level population calculation for recombination. For ions with level resolved rates and PI cross sections, we were double counting. Fixed now.0.0.2.2November 30th 2016: Bugfix to download of new files: urllib.urlcleanup now called more often.0.0.2.3December 8th 2016: Updated to handle 3.0.7.0.0.2.4January 16th 2017: Bugfix for installation, include joblib as a requirement0.0.2.5January 17th 2017: Bugfix for installation, include mock as a requirement0.0.3.0February 21st 2017: Introduced new way to calculated spectra, using the Sessionand Spec objects in spectrum.py. It is intended to make this the main way tocalculate spectra, as it should lead to significant speed enhancements byavoiding lots of unnecessary recalculation of the same numbers.0.0.3.1February 21st 2017: A series of bug fixes to installation and spectral calculation routines. Closes bugs #1, 2, 5 from github0.0.3.2March 21st 2017: Several bug fixes and enhancements to the spectrum module. Updated setup.py to handle import of mock more gracefully0.0.3.3May 5th 2017: Several bug fixes and initial inclusion of charge exchange model0.0.3.4May 23rd 2017: Bug fix to spectrum.apply_response, now handles response filesindexed from zero (thank you Lia Corrales for finding this issue)0.5.0January 9th 2018: Major updates to include CX models. Increased version number to something relevant to 3 decimal style.0.5.1February 14th 2018: Bugfix to use 64bit floats for ionization fraction calculation, which was occasionally causing issues.0.5.2May 10th 2018: Bugfixes, including one where angstrom spectra where generated backwards.0.5.3June 14th 2018: Bugfixes: NEI spectrum session fixed to assign bin units correctly when using a response file0.5.4September 03rd 2018: Bugfix: NEI spectrum.Session.set_specbins now correctly resets the spectra when changed. Thanks to Shinya Nakashima for discovering this bug.0.6.0November 20th 2018: Switch to python 3 support only. Python 2.7 support available for now through Github0.7.0Bug fixes aplenty, mostly due to python 3 conversion.0.7.1April 22nd 2019: Fixed bug occuring with spectrum continuum broadening.0.7.2May 6th 2019: Add option 'ALL' to get_data to download all the data files foran ion at once0.8.0January 27th 2020: Major overhaul of Spectrum module.Updated paths for the FTP server due to file move.0.8.1February 5th 2020: Corrections to NEISpectrum. Spectrum summation much faster andbugs in logic fixed.0.9.0March 20th 2020: Added PShockSession class to specturm module, mimicking XSPEC pshock (parallel shock) model. Other minor bugfixes.0.10.0May 12th 2020: Major update to documentation, spectrum and atomdb modules. Significant rationalization of routines, making many non-public in the documentation. This should help new users understand what is going on. I apologise if it breaks whatever you were doing, please get in touch if the fix is not obvious.0.10.1May 12th 2020: Minor packaging fixes0.10.2May 27th 2020: Bugfix to read_data0.10.3July 14th 2020: Added force keyword to switch_version.
