	<longdescription>The olr function runs all the possible combinations of linear regressions with all of thedependent variables against the independent variable and returns the statistical summaryof either the greatest adjusted R-squared or R-squared term. R-squared increases with the addition of an explanatory variable whether it is 'significant' or not, thus this was developed to eliminate that conundrum. Adjusted R-squared is preferred to overcome this phenomenon, but each combination will still produce different results and this willreturn the best one.dataset = pd.read_csv('C:\Rstuff\olr\inst\extdata\oildata.csv') &lt;br /&gt;responseName = dataset[['OilPrices']] &lt;br /&gt;predictorNames = dataset[['SP500', 'RigCount', 'API', 'Field_Production', 'RefinerNetInput', 'OperableCapacity', 'Imports', 'StocksExcludingSPR']] &lt;br /&gt;The TRUE or FALSE in the olr function, specifies either the adjusted R-squared or the R-squared regression summary, respectfully.When responseName and predictorNames are None (NULL), then the first column in the dataset is set as the responseName and the remaining columns are the predictorNames.Adjusted R-squared &lt;br /&gt;olr(datasetname, resvarname = None, expvarnames = None, adjr2 = &quot;True&quot;)R-squared &lt;br /&gt;olr(datasetname, resvarname = None, expvarnames = None, adjr2 = &quot;False&quot;)list of summaries &lt;br /&gt;olrmodels(datasetname, resvarname = None, expvarnames = None)list of formulas &lt;br /&gt;olrformulas(datasetname, resvarname = None, expvarnames = None)list of forumlas with the dependant variables in ascending order &lt;br /&gt;olrformulasorder(datasetname, resvarname = None, expvarnames = None)the list of adjusted R-squared terms &lt;br /&gt;adjr2list(datasetname, resvarname = None, expvarnames = None)the list of R-squared terms &lt;br /&gt;r2list(datasetname, resvarname = None, expvarnames = None)An R version of this package olr is available on CRAN.</longdescription>
