	<longdescription># AnkdownA simple way to write Anki decks in Markdown.## What This Is[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) is awesome, in many ways.However, its card editor is... a little bit uncomfortable.I really wanted to write Anki cards in Markdown. So I madea tool to convert Markdown (+ standard MathJAX math notation)into Anki decks that can be easily imported. This way, it'spossible to use any fancy markdown (and MathJAX) tools to buildyour decks.## How to use it**NOTE** This program requires _Python 3_, along with thepackages in requirements.txt### InstallingAnkdown can be installed by doing `pip3 install --user ankdown`.### Writing CardsCards are written in the following format:```markdownExpected Value of \(f(x)\)%\[\mathbb{E}[f(x)] = \sum_x p(x)f(x)\]%math, probability---Variance of \(f(x)\)%\[\text{Var}(f(x)) = \mathbb{E}[(f(x) - \mathbb{E}[f(x)])^2]\]```Each of the solitary `%` signs is a field separator: the firstfield is the front of the card, the second field isthe back of the card, and subsequent fields can contain whateveryou want them to (all fields after the second are optional).`---` markers represent a card boundary.The tool needs these separators to be alone on their own lines,and most markdown editors will work better if you separate them fromother text with empty lines, so that they're treated as their ownparagraphs by the editor.### Running Ankdown#### Method A: manuallyTo compile your cards, put them in markdown files with `.md` extensions,inside of a directory that has the name of the deck you'd like to putthe cards into. Then, run `ankdown -r [directory] -p [package filename]`.You can then import the package using the Anki import tool.#### Method B: via the add-onOnce you've installed ankdown, it can be a hassle to run it on allof your decks over and over again. There is an [`ankdown`Anki add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/109255569) that youcan use to make this process simpler: If you put all of your decksin one megadirectory (mine is in `~/Flashcards`), you can re-importyour decks in one swell foop by going to `Tools &gt; Reload MarkdownDecks` (or using the operating-system-dependent keybinding).## GotchasAnkdown has an unusually large number of known issues; my preferred methodof discussing them is via github ticket.### Multiple DecksAnkdown uses Genanki as a backend, which doesn't (as of this writing) handlemultiple decks in a single package very well. If you point ankdown at adirectory with multiple decks in subdirectories, it will do its best, andyour cards will all be added to the package, but they won't be assignedto the correct decks. The ankdown plugin solves this problem by runningthe executable on each deck individually, and then importing all theresulting packages.### Intentional feature removalsThere used to be other ways to run ankdown, but they were slowly makingthe code worse and worse as I tried to keep them all operational. If there'sa particular method of operating ankdown that you used and miss, let me knowin a github issue.### Math separatorsUnfortunately, `$` and `$$` as math separators were not chosen by the ankidevelopers for the desktop client's MathJax display, and so in order for mathto work in both web and desktop, it became much simpler to use `\(\)` and`\[\]`. These separators should be configurable in most markdown editors(e.g. I use the VSCode Markdown+Math plugin). Older decks that were builtfor ankdown need to be modified to use the new separators.### Media referencesAnkdown should work with media references that result in `src=&quot;&quot;` appearingsomewhere in the generated html (mainly images). If you need it to work withother media types (like sounds), let me know in a github issue and I may maketime to fix this.### Updating CardsWhen you want to modify a card, just run your deck through the aboveprocess after changing the markdown file. Anki should notice, and updatethe card. This is done by giving the cards in your deck unique IDs based ontheir filename and index in the file.This is the most robust solution I could come up with, but it has some downsides:1. It's not possible to automatically remove cards from your anki decks, sincethe anki package importer never deletes cards.2. If you delete a card from a markdown file, ankdown will give all of itssuccessors off-by-one ID numbers, and so if they were different in importantways (like how much you needed to study them), anki will get confused.The best way to deal with this is to give each card its own markdown file.### General code qualityLastly, the catch-all disclaimer: this is, as they say, alpha-quality software.I wrote this program (and the add-on) to work for me; it's pretty likely thatyou'll hit bugs in proportion to how different your desires are from mine. Thatsaid, I want it to be useful for other people as well; please submit githubtickets if you do run into problems!</longdescription>
