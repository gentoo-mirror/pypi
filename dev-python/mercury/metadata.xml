Forget about rewriting notebooks to web frameworks just to share your results. Mercury offers a set of widgets with simple re-execution of cells.You can build with Mercury:- Turn your notebook into beautiful [Web Apps](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/web-app-python-jupyter-notebook/),- Create interactive [Presentations](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/presentation-python-jupyter-notebook/) with widgets, you can recompute slides during the show,- Share notebooks as static [Websites](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/website-python-jupyter-notebook/),- Build data-rich [Dashboards](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/dashboard-python-jupyter-notebook/) with widgets,- Create [Reports](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/report-python-jupyter-notebook/) with PDF exports, automatic scheduling, and email notifications (coming soon),- Serve Python notebooks as [REST API](https://runmercury.com/tutorials/rest-api-python-jupyter-notebook/) endpoints (coming soon).Mercury features:- add widgets with Python code - no frontend experience needed!- hide or show notebook's code,- export executed notebook to PDF or HTML,- share muplitple notebooks - no limits!- embed notebook on any website,- easy file upload and download from the notebook,- add authentication to notebooks (coming soon),- schedule automatic notebook execution (coming soon).## ExampleSimple code example that creates a widget and displays its value. You can interact with a widget in the Jupyter Notebook. Its value will be updated. However, to see the update in other cells you need to **manually execute** them.Import package:```pythonimport mercury as mr```Create a [`Text`](https://runmercury.com/docs/input-widgets/text/) widget:```pythonname = mr.Text(value=&quot;Piotr&quot;, label=&quot;What is your name?&quot;)```Print widget value:```pythonprint(f&quot;Hello {name.value}&quot;)```#### Code in Jupyter Notebook&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;&lt;img     alt=&quot;Web App from Notebook&quot;    src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mljar/visual-identity/main/mercury/hello-world-notebook-ola.png&quot;  /&gt;  &lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/p&gt;#### Mercury AppUse Mercury to run notebook as web application. **Cells are automatically re-executed** after widget change. Mercury re-executes only cells with widget definition and below it. In the example, cells 2 and 3 are re-executed after widget update. &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;&lt;img     alt=&quot;Web App from Notebook&quot;    src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mljar/visual-identity/main/mercury/hello-world-app-ola.gif&quot;  /&gt;     &lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/p&gt;## DocumentationðŸ“š Read more about Mercury on [RunMercury.com](https://RunMercury.com).## Installation*Compatible with Python 3.7 and higher.*Install with `pip`:```pip install mercury```Install with `conda`:```conda install -c conda-forge mercury```## DemoRun Mercury with demo notebooks.```mercury run demo```Please check [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to see demo notebooks.## Mercury with your notebooksTo run Mercury with your notebook, please execute the following:```mercury run```The command should be run in the same directory as notebooks. You can change code in Jupyter Notebook, and Mercury will **instantly** update web app.## Mercury LicenseMercury is released with AGPL v3 license.Looking for dedicated support, a commercial-friendly license, and more features?
