	<longdescription>raw sockets made easy=====================Only in linux, sorry.Rationale---------If you need raw sockets in your python script, you have to run it as rootor make it SUID root. Alternatively, you can use file capabilities to grantextended priviliges to a binary. Unfortunately, this only works on binariesand not on scripts, which means you have to set the capability on thepython binary.How does it work?-----------------As mentioned above, you can only set capabilties on a binary. Therefore,this module has a helper binary, which will get the RAW_NET capability.This binary is spawned by the rawsocket python module every time you createa new raw socket. The helper uses its capability to create the socket andthen passes the file descriptor back to the calling program.In linux you can pass file descriptors through unix domain sockets by usingthe ``sendmsg()`` system call and ``SCM_RIGHTS``. See also `fd passing`_.Installation------------Use PIP::  pip install rawsocketOr use the standard method::  python setup.py installThis will install the extension module and the helper binary. But it will*not* set the file capability on the helper binary. You have two choices:1. Grant every user access to the helper (simple, *not recommended*)::     setcap cap_net_raw+ep rawsocket-helper2. Grant access only to users which are member of a specific group   (recommended)::     chmod 750 rawsocket-helper     chown root:yourgroup rawsocket-helper     setcap cap_net_raw+ep rawsocket-helperExample-------.. code:: python  import socket, rawsocket  fd = rawsocket.rawsocket_fd()  s = socket.fromfd(fd, socket.AF_PACKET, socket.SOCK_RAW)You see easy as pie ;)License-------Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or withoutmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:1.
