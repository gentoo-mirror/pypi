	<longdescription>Internet-Draft text to XML Conversion Tool==========================================This tool, 'id2xml', is intended for use by the RFC-Editor staff, in order toproduce a first xml2rfc-compatible XML version from text-only Internet-Draftsubmissions.id2xml may also be useful for Internet-Draft authors who wish to start workingon a new version of an older draft or RFC, for which no xml2rfc-compatible XMLsource is available.Version 1.x can process the drafts specified in the development Statement ofWork to XML files acceptable to xml2rfc, and can also process a number ofother test files to acceptable XML.  Missing is internal &lt;xref/&gt; links tofigures and tables.The default XML produced follows RFC 7749 [1]_ in version 1.x of the tool.With version 1.3.0 of the tool, output according to RFC 7991 [2]_ is availableby use of the '-3' switch.  .. [1] Reschke, J., &quot;The &quot;xml2rfc&quot; Version 2 Vocabulary&quot;, RFC 7749, DOI   10.17487/RFC7749, February 2016, &lt;http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7749&gt;... [2] Hoffman, P., &quot;The &quot;xml2rfc&quot; Version 3 Vocabulary&quot;, RFC 7991, DOI   10.17487/RFC7991, December 2016, http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7991&gt;.Changelog=========Version 1.5.0 (03 Sep 2019)------------------------------------------------  * Fixed a few Python 3.x nits in the parser code.  * Changed generated anchor slugs so as to not collide with IDs used by     xml2rfc, which in v3 mode reserves certain prefixes used for section,     figure and table anchors and fragment identifiers.  Also fixed an xml2rfc     v2v3 convertere compatibility issue.  * Added outdent to id2xml progress statements in order to more clearly     differentiate them from warnings and errors.  * Added the possibility of setting document stream, IPR, and consensus     values with switches instead of deriving them from the 'Status of this     Memo' section, to make processing of documents with old status wording     easier.  * Added a list of valid submission types and stream names to id2xml.utils.  * Tweaked several command-line options to better match those of xml2rfc.      Added help for trace options when --help is given together with --debug.Version 1.4.4 (17 Oct 2018)------------------------------------------------  * Since '--' isn't allowed inside html comments, trying to add a comment     that contains that string will fail.  Under some circumstances, id2xml    inserts comments about conversion errors into the generated xml, and    if the failed text contained '--', this would fail.  Tweaked comment    insertion to avoid this.  * Added code to look for Abstract both before and after Status-of-Memo     and Copyright sections.  The placement of the Abstract changes around the     time of RFC 5550.</longdescription>
