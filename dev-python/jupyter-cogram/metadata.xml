Install it with```bashpython -m jupyter_cogram --token YOUR_TOKEN```That's it! You can now start a new Jupyter Notebook server with ```bashjupyter notebook```and you're ready to go!### Updating CogramThe easiest way to upgrade to a new version of Cogram is using pip:```bashpip install -U jupyter-cogram```You'll then have to kill any active Jupyter Notebook servers and start a new one with ```bashjupyter notebook```### Uninstalling CogramTo remove Cogram from your system, simply use pip:```bashpip uninstall jupyter-cogram```Finally, remove Cogram from the list of extensions Jupyter will load when you start a Notebook:```bashjupyter nbextension disable jupyter-cogram/main```## üìö Use Cogram### üõ´ First startIf you've installed Cogram by following the instructions on your [My Account](https://get.cogram.com/account) page your API tokenwill automatically be saved. You can open a Jupyter Notebook and get started.  You may be asked for your API token when you open a new Notebook for the first time. If this happens, paste the API token from your [My Account](https://get.cogram.com/account) page into the prompt box that opens when you start a new Jupyter Notebook.The Cogram extension is on by default. You can toggle the extension off and on by clicking the Cogram button (&lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;14&quot; src=&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61294dc1bd225d7c490b4389/6131d7249979f73249363dd0_icon_black_64.png&quot; /&gt;) in the toolbar of your Jupyter Notebook. The green circle indicates that Cogram is on.   ### üîÆ Working with CogramYou can use Cogram in two ways:- Generating code from plain language by writing a comment and completing with the Tab key- Comleting code you've written with the Tab keyThe status light will turn orange indicating that Cogram is busy.  For example, writing the comment```python# fibonacci sequence```and hitting the Tab key will generate a function that produces the Fibonacci sequence.Alternatively, writing the code```pythondef fibonacci```and hitting the Tab key will complete the function to produce the Fibonacci sequence. Once your code has been generated you can explore different options with the ‚Üê and ‚Üí keys. If you're happy with a suggestion you can accept it with the Tab key.### üí° Tips for working with CogramCogram works especially well if you give it some context. Cogram knows the code in your notebook above the current position of your cursor. The more code you've already written, the better Cogram will work.### üìö Support For help with Cogram please join our support channel in [community].</longdescription>
