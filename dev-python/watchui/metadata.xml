These black box are ignored during comparison._&lt;img src=&quot;assets/example-ignore-areas.png&quot;&gt;_The red rectangles outlining missing elements on compared screens_&lt;img src=&quot;assets/example-difference.jpg&quot;&gt;## Important notice for users ## For users with WindowsThe scikit image library is used for image matching. Unfortunately, this is a scientific library. You need to have these libraries for installed to use them properly on windows:- Windows 10 SDK- C++ x64/x86 build toolsThese libraries can be downloaded by using [VS studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/cs/) (not vscode) and installing the msbuild tool from VS studio.Alternatively, [this library](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/cs/visual-cpp-build-tools/) should also work.## WatchUI 1.0 vs 2.x.xWatchUI 2.0 brings breaking changes. Dev team decided to streamline the library and focus it solely on the image and text comparison. This allows us to remove the implicit dependency on browser automation libraries - namely SeleniumLibrary, which was implicit part of the library via RF `BuiltIn()` import of the SeleniumLibrary instance.This is no longer the case - user of the WatchUI therefore **can and have to choose, what UI automation library will use** and provide screenshots to the WatchUI keywords to be compared. It could be now used with SeleniumLibrary, Browser library, Sikuli, Appium or any other UI library where visual validation is required.Version 1.x.x is no longer supported, but it is still available on [Pypi](pip install WatchUI==1.0.11).</longdescription>
