	<longdescription># Voice Assistant [![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/voiceassistant?style=flat-square)](https://pypistats.org/packages/voiceassistant)Open-source voice assistant with emphasis on customizability. Create your own skills and personalize your assistant in a simple YAML configuration. Perfect to use in combination with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).## Unique Features- Say trigger word e.g. &quot;Jarvis&quot; anywhere in a sentence, for example, *&quot;play music, Jarvis&quot;*. Few last seconds of audio input are recoded into memory, so when trigger word is said, pre-recorded audio data is also processed- Speech is processed continuously while user is speaking which, for certain requests, results in a very fast action/response- Voice Assistant REST API enables remote control. For example, it can be used to make Voice Assistant say something when Home Assistant automation is triggered- Define custom skills and extend the nlp &quot;vocubulary&quot; in a simple configuration file## Available Integrations[![homepage][1]][2] [![homepage][3]][4] [![homepage][5]][6][1]:  /docs/icons/hass.png[2]:  /docs/integrations/hass.md &quot;Home Assistant&quot;[3]:  /docs/icons/spotify.png[4]:  /docs/integrations/spotify.md &quot;Spotify&quot;[5]:  /docs/icons/respeaker.png[6]:  /docs/integrations/respeaker.md &quot;ReSpeaker Microphones&quot;[How they work?](/docs/integrations/how.md)## Getting Started- [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation.md)- [First time configuration](/docs/getting-started/first-time-config.md)- [Personalization](/docs/getting-started/personalization.md)- [Enabling integrations](/docs/getting-started/integrations.md)- [Creating custom skills](/docs/getting-started/skills.md)</longdescription>
