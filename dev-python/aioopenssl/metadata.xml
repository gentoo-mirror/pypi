	<longdescription>OpenSSL Transport for asyncio#############################.. image:: https://github.com/horazont/aioopenssl/workflows/CI/badge.svg  :target: https://github.com/horazont/aioopenssl/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Adevel.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/horazont/aioopenssl/badge.svg?branch=devel  :target: https://coveralls.io/github/horazont/aioopenssl?branch=devel``aioopenssl`` provides a `asyncio&lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html&gt;`_ Transport which uses`PyOpenSSL &lt;https://pyopenssl.readthedocs.org/&gt;`_ instead of the built-in sslmodule.The transport has two main advantages compared to the original:* The TLS handshake can be deferred by passing ``use_starttls=True`` and later  calling the ``starttls()`` coroutine method.  This is useful for protocols with a `STARTTLS  &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STARTTLS&gt;`_ feature.* A coroutine can be called during the TLS handshake; this can be used to defer  the certificate check to a later point, allowing e.g. to get user feedback  before the ``starttls()`` method returns.  This allows to ask users for certificate trust without the application layer  protocol interfering or starting to communicate with the unverified peer... note::   Use this module at your own risk. It has lower test coverage than I’d like   it to have; it has been exported from aioxmpp on request, where it undergoes   implicit testing. If you find bugs, please report them. If possible, add   regression tests while you’re at it.   If you find security-critical bugs, please follow the procedure announced in   the `aioxmpp readme &lt;https://github.com/horazont/aioxmpp&gt;`_.`Documentation-------------Official documentation can be built with sphinx and is available online`on our servers &lt;https://docs.zombofant.net/aioopenssl/0.6/&gt;`_.</longdescription>
