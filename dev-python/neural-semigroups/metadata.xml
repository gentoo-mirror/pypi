A solved Sudoku puzzleis nothing more than a Cayley table of a quasigroup from 9 items withsome well-known additional properties. So, one can imagine a puzzle madefrom a Cayley table of any other magma, e.g. a semigroup, by hiding partof its cells.There are two major differences between sudoku and puzzles based onsemigroups:1) it’s easy to take a glance on a table to understand whether it is a   sudoku or not. That’s why it was possible to encode numbers in a   table cells as colour intensities. Sudoku is a picture, and a   semigroup is not. It’s difficult to check a Cayley table’s   associativity with a naked eye;2) Sudoku puzzles are solved by humans for fun and thus catalogued. When   solving a sudoku one knows for sure that there is a unique solution.   On the contrary, nobody guesses values in a partially filled Cayley   table of a semigroup as a form of amusement. As a result, one can   create a puzzle from a full Cayley table of a semigroup but there may   be many distinct solutions.How to Install==============The best way to install this package is to use ``pip``:.. code:: sh   pip install neural-semigroupsHow to use==========The simplest way to get started is to `use GoogleColaboratory &lt;https://colab.research.google.com/github/inpefess/neural-semigroups/blob/master/examples/dae_4_colab.ipynb&gt;`__.To look at more experimental results for different semigroupscardinalities, you can use `Kaggle &lt;https://kaggle.com&gt;`__:-  `cardinality   4 &lt;https://www.kaggle.com/inpefess/neural-semigroups-dae-dim-4&gt;`__-  `cardinality   5 &lt;https://www.kaggle.com/inpefess/neural-semigroups-dae-dim-5&gt;`__There is also an experimental`notebook &lt;https://github.com/inpefess/neural-semigroups/blob/master/examples/ExperimentNotebook.ipynb&gt;`__contributed by `Žarko Bulić &lt;https://github.com/zarebulic&gt;`__.How to Contribute=================`Pull requests &lt;https://github.com/inpefess/neural-semigroups/pulls&gt;`__are welcome. To start:.. code:: sh   git clone https://github.com/inpefess/neural-semigroups   cd neural-semigroups   # activate python virtual environment with Python 3.6+   pip install -U pip   pip install -U setuptools wheel poetry   poetry install   # recommended but not necessary   pre-commit installTo check the code quality before creating a pull request, one might runthe script`show_report.sh &lt;https://colab.research.google.com/github/inpefess/neural-semigroups/blob/master/show_report.sh&gt;`__.It locally does nearly the same as the CI pipeline after the PR iscreated.Reporting issues or problems with the software==============================================Questions and bug reports are welcome on `thetracker &lt;https://github.com/inpefess/neural-semigroups/issues&gt;`__.More documentation==================More documentation can be found`here &lt;https://neural-semigroups.readthedocs.io/en/latest&gt;`__... |Open In Colab| image:: https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg   :target: https://colab.research.google.com/github/inpefess/neural-semigroups/blob/master/examples/dae_4_colab.ipynb.. |PyPI version| image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/neural-semigroups.svg   :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/neural-semigroups.. |CircleCI| image:: https://circleci.com/gh/inpefess/neural-semigroups.svg?style=svg   :target: https://circleci.com/gh/inpefess/neural-semigroups.. |Documentation Status| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/neural-semigroups/badge/?version=latest   :target: https://neural-semigroups.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest.. |codecov| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/inpefess/neural-semigroups/branch/master/graph/badge.svg   :target: https://codecov.io/gh/inpefess/neural-semigroups</longdescription>
