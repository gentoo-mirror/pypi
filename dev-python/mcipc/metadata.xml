	<longdescription>[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/mcipc/badge/?version=latest)](https://mcipc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)# mcipcA Minecraft inter-process communication API implementing the [RCON](http://wiki.vg/RCON) and [Query](http://wiki.vg/Query) protocols.## News### 2020-12-21 - mcipc-2.0Great news: `mcipc` is now available in version 2.The version 2 update includes the outsourcing of the RCON protocol and client implementation into an [own project](https://github.com/conqp/rcon).This allowes for the RCON library to be used independently of mcipc, e.g. for other games which support the RCON protocol.Furthermore `mcipc`'s RCON client implementations have been overhauled. They now provide functions to interact with the respective server.It was therefor necessary to not have one implementation of `mcipc.rcon.Client`, but three:*  `mcipc.rcon.be.Client` Client for Bedrock Edition servers.*  `mcipc.rcon.ee.Client` Client for Education Edition servers.*  `mcipc.rcon.je.Client` Client for Java Edition servers.To provide some backwards compatibility, the `mcipc.rcon.Client` is now an alias for `mcipc.rcon.je.Client`.You'll find a full documentation of each client's capabilities, i.e. methods in the [documentation](https://mcipc.readthedocs.io/en/latest).## Requirements`mcipc` requires Python 3.9 or higher.It also depends on [rcon](https://github.com/conqp/rcon) which has been split from this project.If you install `mcicp` via `pip`, it will automatically be installed as a dependency.## DocumentationDocumentation is available on [readthedocs](https://mcipc.readthedocs.io/en/latest).## Quick startInstall mcipc from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-mcipc/) or via:    pip install mcipc### Query protocolThe `Query` protcol is used to query a Minecraft server for server information.The Minecraft query protocol has two query modes: *basic stats* and *full stats*.```pythonfrom mcipc.query import Clientwith Client('127.0.0.1', 25565) as client:    basic_stats = client.stats()            # Get basic stats.    full_stats = client.stats(full=True)    # Get full stats.print(basic_stats)print(full_stats)```### RCON protocolThe `RCON` protocol is used to remotely control a Minecraft server, i.e. executecommands on a Minecraft server and receive the respective results.```pythonfrom mcipc.rcon.je import Biome, Client     # For Java Edition servers.#from mcipc.rcon.be import Client           # For Bedrock Edition servers.#from mcipc.rcon.ee import Client           # For Education Edition servers.with Client('127.0.0.1', 5000, passwd='mysecretpassword') as client:    seed = client.seed                              # Get the server's seed.    players = client.list()                         # Get the server's players info.    mansion = client.locate('mansion')              # Get the next mansion's location.    badlands = client.locatebiome(Biome.BADLANDS)   # Get the next location of a badlands biome.print(seed)print(players)print(mansion)print(badlands)```Example output of the above commands with a Java Edition client:```python-8217057902979500137Players(online=1, max=20, players=[Player(name='coNQP', uuid=None, state=None)])Location(name='mansion', x=-7216, y=None, z=-1952, distance=7479)Location(name='minecraft:badlands', x=1512, y=None, z=3388, distance=3634)```## CreditsMany thanks to all contributers to the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/) and the [Wiki.vg](https://wiki.vg/Main_Page).## LicenseCopyright (C) 2018-2021 Richard Neumann &lt;mail at richard dash neumann period de&gt;mcipc is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modifyit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or(at your option) any later version.mcipc is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty ofMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
