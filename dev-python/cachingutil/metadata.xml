	<longdescription>cachinhgutil============A hierarchy of classes to provide caching functionalitywith minimal fuss.When using the cache, just use the fetch method.This will pull from the cache if it's present andnot expired otherwise will use 'fetch_from_source'.Cache-----Abstract class.Not expected to be used. Provides the methodsneeded by subclasses provided by the package.Methods that need to be implemented in the concrete class:    key    fetch_from_source    cache    fetch_from_cache_by_key    delete_by_key    expiry_timeOptional:    cookBaseMemoryClass---------------Abstract class.Methods that must be implemented in concrete class:    key    fetch_from_source    calculate_expiryOptional:    cookSimpleMemoryClass-----------------Abstract class.Methods that must be implemented in concrete class:    key    fetch_from_sourceOptinal:    cookBaseHttpMemoryCache-------------------Abstract class.Caches requests objects or objects generated from requests.TODO: Improve expiry calculations. Currently only uses max age.Methods that must be implemented in concrete class:    key    fetch_from_source    get_request_for_item (if caching objects generated from request objects)Optinal:    cookHttpMemoryCache---------------Concrete class.Uses the url string as the key.Uses requests.get as fetch_from_source.Use:Instantiate and use instance.fetch(url) to fetch from the cache or source.BinaryFileCache---------------Abstract class.Reads from and writes to binary files. Suitable for cachingimages.Methods that must be implemented in concrete class:    key    fetch_from_sourceOptional:    cookFileCache---------Abstract class.Reads from and writes to files with encoding.Methods that must be implemented in concrete class:    key    fetch_from_sourceOptional:    cook    encode    decodeJsonFileCache-------------Abstract class.This is just FileCache with JSON encoding and decoding.fetch_from_source should return a JSON string.If OBJECT_PAIRS_HOOK is set, then decode willuse that. Typically use: collections.OrderedDictto retain the order of elements.Methods that must be implemented in concrete class:    key    fetch_from_sourceOptional:    cook    OBJECT_PAIRS_HOOKTwoLevelCache-------------Concrete class.Generally this means an in-memory cache joined to apersistent cache (e.g, file, database). That meansyour cache persists over many executions, but doesn'tneed to access the slower persistent cache more thanonce per item fetched.To use it, implement the two caches and instantiateTwoLevelCache to join them. Pass in-memory cache classas the transient_cache and the persistent cache classas (surprise!) the pesistent_cache.</longdescription>
