	<longdescription>############Transforms3d############Code to convert between various geometric transformations.* Composing rotations / zooms / shears / translations into affine matrix;* Decomposing affine matrix into rotations / zooms / shears / translations;* Conversions between different representations of rotations, including:  * 3x3 Rotation matrices;  * Euler angles;  * quaternions.We have tried to document the algorithms carefully and write clear code in thehope that this code can be a teaching reference.  We document the math behindsome of the algorithms using `sympy &lt;http://www.sympy.org&gt;`_ in``transforms3d/derivations``.  We would be very pleased if y'all would like toadd your own algorithms and derivations - please get a copy of the code fromhttps://github.com/matthew-brett/transforms3d and get on down,algorithmically.  Feel free to use the github issue tracker and pull requestsystem to ask for advice and support.*************Documentation*************Documentation for latest released version athttp://matthew-brett.github.io/transforms3d****Code****See https://github.com/matthew-brett/transforms3dReleased under the BSD two-clause license - see the file ``LICENSE`` in thesource distribution.Much of the code comes from `transformations.py&lt;http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/code/transformations.py.html&gt;`_ by ChristophGohlke, also released under the BSD license.We use Github actions to test the code automatically under Pythons 3.7 through3.10.We depend on numpy &gt;= 1.15.  You may be able to make it work on an earliernumpy if you really needed that.The latest released version is at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/transforms3d*******Support*******Please put up issues on the `transforms3d issue tracker&lt;https://github.com/matthew-brett/transforms3d/issues&gt;`_.</longdescription>
