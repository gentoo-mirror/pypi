Web application mashups integrate heterogeneous data, applicationlogic, and UI components (widgets) sourced from the Web to create new coherentand value-adding composite applications. They are targeted at leveraging the&quot;long tail&quot; of the Web of Services (a.k.a. the Programmable Web) by exploitingrapid development, DIY, and shareability. They typically serve a specificsituational (i.e. immediate, short-lived, customized) need, frequently with highpotential for reuse. Is this &quot;situational&quot; character which precludes them to beoffered as 'off-the-shelf' functionality by solution providers, and thereforecreates the need for a tool like WireCloud.This project is part of [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/).

Users use the platformto build and/or use their interfaces using deployed widgets and developers, whereas developers docreate such components by extending existing ones or creating them from scratch.In the former, final users can find useful information in the [User Guide](https://wirecloud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/). In the latter,developers can learn how to develop components in the [Programmer Guide](https://wirecloud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/restapi/)## Bugs and feature requestsHave a bug or a feature request? Please first read the[issue guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#using-the-issue-tracker) and search forexisting and closed issues.

On the one side, Python code is beingtested using Django's own testing capabilities. On the other side, JavaScript code testing is basedon Karma and Jasmine. Both tests are run on a local copy of the[WireCloud repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Wirecloud/wirecloud), insidethe `src` folder.### Python codeBefore running the tests, you have to ensure all the python dependencies areinstalled on the environment. To do so, execute the following commands on the`src` folder:    $ pip install -r requirements.txt    $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txtOnce installed all the dependencies, you can run the Python tests by using thefollowing command:    $ python manage.py test --nologcapture -v 2 -a tags='wirecloud-noselenium'WireCloud also comes with some selenium tests that can be executed using thefollowing command:    $ python manage.py test --nologcapture -v 2 -a tags='wirecloud-selenium'In this case, you will need to have Chrome and Firefox installed as well as[chromedriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/) and [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).### JavaScript codeBefore being able to test JavaScript code, some dependencies have to beinstalled:    $ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli    $ npm installOnce installed all the npm dependencies, tests can be executed using `grunt`:    $ grunt---## LicenseWireCloud is licensed under Affero General Public License (GPL) version 3 (orany later, at your option) with classpath-like exception.### Are there any legal issues with AGPL 3.0? Is it safe for me to use?There is absolutely no problem in using a product licensed under AGPL 3.0. Issues with GPL (or AGPL) licenses are mostly related with the fact that different people assign different interpretations on the meaning of the term “derivate work” used in these licenses. Due to this,some people believe that there is a risk in just _using_ software under GPL or AGPL licenses(even without _modifying_ it).For the avoidance of doubt, the owners of this software licensed under an AGPL-3.0 license  wish to make a clarifying public statement as follows:&gt; Please note that software derived as a result of modifying the source code of this&gt; software in order to fix a bug or incorporate enhancements is considered a derivative &gt; work of the product. Software that merely uses or aggregates (i.e. links to) an otherwise &gt; unmodified version of existing software is not considered a derivative work, and therefore&gt; it does not need to be released as under the same license, or even released as open source.</longdescription>
