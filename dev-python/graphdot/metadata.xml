Currently, the library implements the Marginalized Graph Kernel algorithm, which uses a random walk process to compare subtree patterns and thus defining a generalized graph convolution process. The library can operate on undirected graphs, either weighted or unweighted, that contain arbitrary nodal and edge labels and attributes. It implements state-of-the-art GPU acceleration algorithms and supports versatile customization through just-in-time code generation and compilation.For more details, please checkout the latest documentation on [readthedocs](https://graphdot.readthedocs.io/).# CopyrightGraphDot Copyright (c) 2019-2020, The Regents of the University of California,through Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (subject to receipt of anyrequired approvals from the U.S. Dept. of Energy).
