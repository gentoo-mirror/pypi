	<longdescription>..   -*- mode: rst -*-#################virtualenvwrapper#################virtualenvwrapper is a set of extensions to Ian Bicking's `virtualenv&lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv&gt;`_ tool.  The extensions includewrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwisemanaging your development workflow, making it easier to work on morethan one project at a time without introducing conflicts in theirdependencies.**Warning:** The 4.x release includes some potentially incompatiblechanges for extensions from 3.x. The python modules for extensions arenow *always* run with ``PWD=$WORKON_HOME`` (previously the value ofPWD varied depending on the hook). The *shell* portion of any hook(anything sourced by the user's shell when the hook is run) is stillrun in the same place as before.========Features========1.  Organizes all of your virtual environments in one place.2.  Wrappers for creating, copying and deleting environments, including    user-configurable hooks.3.  Use a single command to switch between environments.4.  Tab completion for commands that take a virtual environment as    argument.5. User-configurable hooks for all operations.6. Plugin system for more creating sharable extensions.Rich Leland has created a short `screencast&lt;http://mathematism.com/2009/07/30/presentation-pip-and-virtualenv/&gt;`__showing off the features of virtualenvwrapper.============Installation============See the `project documentation&lt;https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`__ forinstallation and setup instructions.Supported Shells================virtualenvwrapper is a set of shell *functions* defined in Bourneshell compatible syntax.  It is tested under ``bash``, ``ksh``, and ``zsh``.It may work with other shells, so if you find that it does work with ashell not listed here please let me know.  If you can modify it towork with another shell, without completely rewriting it, send a pullrequest through the bitbucket project page.  If you write a clone towork with an incompatible shell, let me know and I will link to itfrom this page.Python Versions===============virtualenvwrapper is tested under Python 2.6 - 3.6.=======Support=======Join the `virtualenvwrapper Google Group&lt;http://groups.google.com/group/virtualenvwrapper/&gt;`__ to discussissues and features.Report bugs via the `bug tracker on Bitbucket&lt;https://bitbucket.org/virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper/issues&gt;`__.Shell Aliases=============Since virtualenvwrapper is largely a shell script, it uses shellcommands for a lot of its actions.  If your environment makes heavyuse of shell aliases or other customizations, you may encounterissues.  Before reporting bugs in the bug tracker, please test*without* your aliases enabled.  If you can identify the alias causingthe problem, that will help make virtualenvwrapper more robust.==========Change Log==========The `release history`_ is part of the project documentation... _release history: https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html=======License=======Copyright Doug Hellmann, All Rights ReservedPermission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and itsdocumentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted,provided that the above copyright notice appear in all copies and thatboth that copyright notice and this permission notice appear insupporting documentation, and that the name of Doug Hellmann not be usedin advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the softwarewithout specific, written prior permission.DOUG HELLMANN DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE,INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS, IN NOEVENT SHALL DOUG HELLMANN BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT ORCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS OFUSE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OROTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE ORPERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.</longdescription>
