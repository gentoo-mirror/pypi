	<longdescription># Getting startedThis is the **beta version** of the public API for the Greenbyte Platform.It contains **new features** (endpoints, parameters, etc.) that weencourage you to try out before they are released as a stable version.**Note that some details might change**, meaning that any SDKsdownloaded for this version might have minor incompatibilities in thefuture.Features that are in beta are clearly marked with the label &quot;**(BETA)**&quot;so that you can know what features are stable. If you would rather viewthe latest stable API documentation, please use the version selectiondropdown in the top right of the page.# What's new## 2022-02-01 - New high resolution endpointA new [data endpoint](#/http/api-endpoints/data/get-high-res-data) has been added which allows you to fetch high resolution data for up to one hour in the past 12 hours.## 2022-01-24 - More plan endpoint additions* [List Device Accesses for multiple Site Accesses](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-device-accesses-for-multiple-site-accesses) - a new endpoint that lists all the Device Accesses for one or more specified SiteAccessID(s).* [Get Personnel By ID](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/get-personnel) - a new endpoint that gets personnel info for a specified Personnel ID.## 2022-01-17 - Various improvements and addition of several new endpoints* A taxonomy component object with ID and name has been added to the status endpoints.* [List Comments for multiple Tasks](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-comments-for-multiple-tasks) - a new endpoint that lists all the comments for one or more specified TaskId(s).## 2021-08-23 - Plan Get endpointsPlan endpoints for getting individual items by ID have been added as a compliment to the existing List endpoints.This includes:* [Get Task by ID](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/get-task)* [Get Downtime by ID](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/get-downtime-event)* [Get Site Access by ID](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/get-site-access)* [Get Device Access by ID](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/get-device-access)## 2021-04-29 - Python SDK now on PyPiThe Python SDK is now available as a package on PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/greenbyteapi/).We will be updating this regularly in parallel with updates to the API specifications.## 2021-04-27 - Improvement to endpointsGet Data Signals: Device type (ID and title) has been added to the response for every data signalto make it easier to differentiate signals with the same name.Get Data Per Category: Category time has been added to the response for every data per category item.## 2021-04-12 - Improvement to List Status endpointTurbine status ID has been added to the status endpoint.## 2021-03-22 - Improvement to List Site Accesses endpointThe List Site Accesses endpoint now returns all individual personnel and the times they accessed the site.## 2021-03-15 - Improvements to Plan endpointsThe List Tasks endpoint now returns related metadata fields.## 2021-02-15 - More Plan endpoints **(BETA)**We have added the following endpoints under the **Plan** section:* [List Task Categories](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-task-categories)* [List Organizations](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-organizations)* [List Personnel](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-personnel)* [List Task Files](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-task-files)* [Download Task File](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/download-task-file)## 2021-02-08 - Add UTC supportUTC support has been added for all endpoints that return timestamps.By setting the `useUtc` flag to true timestamps will be returned in UTC time zone instead of client time zone.The flag is set to false by default.## 2021-01-25 - Plan endpoints **(BETA)**We have introduced a **Plan** section containing the following endpoints:* [List Tasks](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-tasks)* [List Task Comments](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-task-comments)* [List Downtime Events](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-downtime-events)* [List Site Accesses](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-site-accesses)* [List Device Accesses](#/http/api-endpoints/plan/list-device-accesses)## 2021-01-18 - API key authentication changesThe preferred method of authenticating with the API is now to pass theAPI key via the HTTP header `X-Api-Key`. The old methods, passing it asquery parameter or via the old header `Breeze-ApiToken`, will continueto work but are deprecated.Note that this change causes a breaking change in some of the SDKs, forexample, if you use the C# SDK and explicitly set the API key on the`Configuration` class. This is only an issue if you download a newversion of the SDK and want to use it with existing code.* Solution: Instead of adding the API key to the  `ApiToken`/`BreezeApiToken` property, you need to use the `XApiKey`  property.## 2021-01-11 - Optional `.json` suffixThe `.json` suffix is no longer necessary when calling the API. Thatmeans that calls to for instance `configuration` or `configuration.json`will return the same result. Endpoints that currently support the`.json` suffix will continue to do so but it is considered deprecated.## 2020-08-31 - Endpoint permissionsWe have added more fine-grained permissions for the API. When creating or editing an API key, you can now set permissions for specific API endpoints ([API key guide](#/http/guides/managing-api-keys)). Existing API keys will have permissions for all existing endpoints.See the documentation for specific endpoints for information on which permissions are required.## 2020-08-28 - Improvement for status endpointsIt is now possible to select which lost production signal will be returned when requesting status data from the API. The following endpoints are affected:* [Get Statuses](#/http/api-endpoints/assets/get-statuses)* [Get Active Statuses](#/http/api-endpoints/assets/get-active-statuses)## 2020-08-20 - Real Time Data and Data Per Category endpoints aggregation by site levelYou can now aggregate your data based on site hierarchy levels when calling the Real Time Data and Data Per Category endpoints.The new `siteLevel` aggregation mode (`aggregate` parameter) enable this new type of aggregation.## 2020-06-29 - Site endpointWe have added a new endpoint for fetching sites and related meta data.You can find more information about this endpoint here:[Get Sites](#/http/api-endpoints/assets/get-sites).## 2020-06-29 - Device endpoint improvementsThe Device endpoint has been improved:* New request parameters for filtering on sites (`siteIds`) and/or  parent devices (`parentIds`).* New response fields for device type (`deviceTypeId`), parent device  (`parentId`), and child devices (`childIds`)## 2020-06-29 - Data endpoint aggregation by site levelYou can now aggregate your data according to the site hierarchy which you can see in the device selector when calling the Data endpoint.The new `siteLevel` aggregation mode (`aggregate` parameter) aggregates data based on the site hierarchy.## 2020-06-29 - Minor API improvements### Problem description in error responsesAPI error responses such as *400 Bad Request* now contain details aboutwhat is wrong, for example, if a request parameter is missing or hasinvalid value. See the error response description for each endpoint forspecific examples.### Changes to HTTP rate limit headersThe format of the HTTP headers regarding rate limiting has changed:* `X-Rate-Limit-Limit` - This now contains the rate limit period as a  string (previously the number of allowed requests for a given period).* `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` - The remaining number of requests for this  period (like before, no change).* `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` - This now contains the UTC timestamp string when  the remaining number of requests resets (previously the number of  seconds left until the end of the period).More information is available under the *429 Too Many Requests* errorresponse description for each endpoint.### Support for time zone offsets in timestamp parametersIt is now possible to specify timestamp strings with an explicit timezone (UTC) offset, for example &quot;2020-05-10T09:00:00+01:30&quot;.### Proper use of error response codesSome error responses with the code *401 Unauthorized* will now insteadbe *403 Forbidden* to better match web API best practices. This is workin progress, with the goal of having all failed authorization checksreturn code 403 rather than 401 in the future.## 2020-06-08 - Data endpoint aggregation by groupIf you have divided you sites into groups of assets, you can now aggregate your data by those groups when calling the Data, Real Time Data, and Data Per Category endpoints.The new `deviceLevel` aggregation mode (`aggregate` parameter) aggregates data based on the hierarchy level directly below site.## 2020-04-27 - Data signal permissionsIt is now possible to set permissions for individual data signals for API keys (**Share** &gt; **API Keys** in the GreenbytePlatform). When adding/editing an API key, there is a new option to select authorized data signals in addition to thedevice selection. Leaving the signal selection blank (nothing selected) gives permission to all current and future datasignals, just like previously created API keys.API endpoints affected by data signal permissions:* `datasignals.json`: filters returned data signals based on permissions.* `data.json`, `realtimedata.json`, `datapercategory.json`: gives *401 Unauthorized* error for data signals without permission.* `status.json`, `activestatus.json`: may omit lost production values (in the `lostProduction` field) based on data signal permissions.## 2020-03-30 - Data Per Category endpointWe have added a new endpoint to the Greenbyte Platform to make it possible to extract Lost Production data per contract category from the API. You can find more information about this endpoint here: [Data Per Category](#/http/api-endpoints/data/get-data-per-category).# General notes regarding endpoints* Some endpoints take `page` and `pageSize` parameters in order to  support fetching data in chunks. The default values are 50 for  `pageSize` and 1 for `page`, meaning that the first 50 items will be  returned. These endpoints also return a `Link` header as defined in  [RFC 8288](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288).* Some endpoints return data in the time zone configured in the Greenbyte Platform. This time zone can  be fetched from the `configuration.json` endpoint.* Some endpoints can also be reached using the POST method, with a JSON  request body instead of query parameters. As this is a legacy option,  make sure to use the legacy version of the endpoints, ending in `.json` (e.g. `data.json`).* All endpoints implement rate limiting, which is currently 1,000  requests/minute per API key and IP address. More information is  available under the *429 Too Many Requests* error response description  for each endpoint.## How to BuildYou must have Python ```2 &gt;=2.7.9``` or Python ```3 &gt;=3.4``` installed on your system to install and run this SDK. This SDK package depends on other Python packages like nose, jsonpickle etc. These dependencies are defined in the ```requirements.txt``` file that comes with the SDK.To resolve these dependencies, you can use the PIP Dependency manager. Install it by following steps at [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).Python and PIP executables should be defined in your PATH. Open command prompt and type ```pip --version```.This should display the version of the PIP Dependency Manager installed if your installation was successful and the paths are properly defined.* Using command line, navigate to the directory containing the generated files (including ```requirements.txt```) for the SDK.* Run the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. This should install all the required dependencies.![Building SDK - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=installDependencies&amp;workspaceFolder=Greenbyte%20API-Python)## How to UseThe following section explains how to use the Greenbyteapi SDK package in a new project.### 1.
