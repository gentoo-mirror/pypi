	<longdescription># SMURFS![SMURFS Image](https://i.imgur.com/Uh2UhpZ.png)**SMURFS** provides automatic extraction of frequencies fromtimeseries. It provides various interfaces, from a standalone command line tool, to jupyter and python integrations and computes possible frequency combinations, directly downloads and reduces (if necessary) data of TESS/Kepler/K2 observations and much much more.## Getting startedTo install smurfs, you need python &gt; 3.5, pip as well as cmake. If you don't have these, install them through thepacket manager of your choice (f.e. _brew_(Mac) or _apt_ (Debian)). For pip check [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).## InstallationFirst off, create a virtual environment```bashcd /Path/python3 -m venv venv/source venv/bin/activate```Install smurfs through pip```bashpip install smurfs```## QuickstartUsing SMURFS as a standalone command line tool is very simple. Simply call ```smurfs``` with a **target**, signal to noiseratio cutoff and the window size. The target can be either:- A path to a file, containing 2 columns with time and flux- Any name of a star, that is resolvable by Simbad and has been observed by the **Kepler**,**K2** or **TESS** missions.As an example, we can take a look at the star Gamma Doradus:```smurfs &quot;Gamma Doradus&quot; 4 2```SMURFS creates a result folder after running the code. In this case it has the following structure```- Gamma_Doradus    - data        - _combinations.csv        - _result.csv        - LC_residual.txt        - LC.txt        - PS_residual.txt        - PS.txt             - plots        - LC_residual.pdf        - LC.pdf        - PS_residual.pdf        - PS_result.pdf        - PS.pdf```The ```LC*.txt``` files contain the light curves, original and residual. The ```PS*.txt``` files contain the original as well as the residual amplitude spectrum. ```_combinations.csv``` shows all combination frequencies for the result and ```_result.csv``` gives the result for a given run.## CitingIf you use this software in your research, consider citing  it using Zenodo.[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3768032.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3768032)If you use SMURFS to extract LC data from FFIs, you should also cite the awesome people of Eleanor.[Feinstein et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019PASP..131i4502F/abstract)## DocumentationFull documentation is available [here](https://smurfs.readthedocs.io/en/master/)</longdescription>
