	<longdescription>pefile, Portable Executable reader moduleAll the PE file basic structures are available with their default names asattributes of the instance returned.Processed elements such as the import table are made available with lowercasenames, to differentiate them from the upper case basic structure names.pefile has been tested against many edge cases such as corrupted and malformedPEs as well as malware, which often attempts to abuse the format way beyond itsstandard use. To the best of my knowledge most of the abuse is handledgracefully.Copyright (c) 2005-2023 Ero Carrera &lt;ero.carrera@gmail.com&gt;</longdescription>
