This does not mean neomodel will stop working on Python 3.7, butit will no longer be tested against it. Instead, we will try to addsupport for Python 3.12.Another potential breaking change coming up is adding async support toneomodel. But we do not know when this will happen yet, or if it willactually be a breaking change. We will definitely push this in a majorrelease though. More to come on that later.Finally, we are looking at refactoring some standalone methods into theDatabase() class. More to come on that later.# InstallationInstall from pypi (recommended):    $ pip install neomodel ($ source dev # To install all things needed in a Python3 venv)    # Neomodel has some optional dependencies (including Shapely), to install these use:    $ pip install neomodel['extras']To install from github:    $ pip install git+git://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neomodel.git@HEAD#egg=neomodel-dev# ContributingIdeas, bugs, tests and pull requests always welcome. Please useGitHub\'s Issues page to track these.If you are interested in developing `neomodel` further, pick a subjectfrom the Issues page and open a Pull Request (PR) for it. If you areadding a feature that is not captured in that list yet, consider if thework for it could also contribute towards delivering any of the existingissues too.## Running the test suiteMake sure you have a Neo4j database version 4 or higher to run the testson.:    $ export NEO4J_BOLT_URL=bolt://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@localhost:7687 # check your username and passwordEnsure `dbms.security.auth_enabled=true` in your database configurationfile. Setup a virtual environment, install neomodel for development andrun the test suite: :    $ pip install -e '.[dev]'    $ pytestThe tests in \&quot;test_connection.py\&quot; will fail locally if you don\'tspecify the following environment variables:    $ export AURA_TEST_DB_USER=username    $ export AURA_TEST_DB_PASSWORD=password    $ export AURA_TEST_DB_HOSTNAME=urlIf you are running a neo4j database for the first time the test suitewill set the password to \'test\'. If the database is already populated,the test suite will abort with an error message and ask you to re-run itwith the `--resetdb` switch. This is a safeguard to ensure that the testsuite does not accidentally wipe out a database if you happen to nothave restarted your Neo4j server to point to a (usually named)`debug.db` database.If you have `docker-compose` installed, you can run the test suiteagainst all supported Python interpreters and neo4j versions: :    # in the project's root folder:    $ sh ./tests-with-docker-compose.sh</longdescription>
