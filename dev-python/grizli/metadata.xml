Along with adetailed description of the format of the configuration files originallydeveloped for the aXe software, we provided a compact `Pythonscript &lt;https://github.com/WFC3Grism/CodeDescription/blob/master/axe_disperse.py&gt;`__to address exactly the question above and strip away all of the manylayers of bookkeeping, file-IO, etc. in existing analysis pipelines suchas aXe (`Kummel et al.2009 &lt;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009PASP..121...59K&gt;`__) and&quot;THREEDHST&quot; (`Brammer et al.2012 &lt;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJS..200...13B&gt;`__, `Momchevaet al. 2015 &lt;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv151002106M&gt;`__). Infact, that relatively simple script serves as the low-level kernel forthe way `grizli` computes the grism dispersion.Eventually, `grizli` is intended to encourage and enable general users to moveaway from simple &quot;data reduction&quot; (e.g., extracting a 1D spectrum of asingle object akin to standard slit spectroscopy) and towardmore quantitative and comprehensive **modeling** and fitting of slitlessspectroscopic observations, which typically involve overlapping spectraof hundreds or thousands of objects in exposures taken with one or moreseparate grisms and at multiple dispersion position angles. The productsof this type of analysis will be complete and uniform characterizationof the spectral properties (e.g., continuum shape, redshifts, linefluxes) of all objects in a given exposure taken in the slitlessspectroscopic mode.Installation &amp; Documentation~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Installation instructions and documentation (in progress) can be found at http://grizli.readthedocs.io.Working Examples~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The following are IPython/jupyter notebooks demonstrating various aspects of the code functionality.
