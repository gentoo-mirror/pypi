	<longdescription>tweedie is a Python library implementing scipy's ``rv_continuous`` classfor the Tweedie family. The Tweedie family is a member of the exponentialdispersion model family and is commonly used in the insurance indsutryto model claim amounts for insurance policies (exposure).The main focus of this package is the compound-Poisson behavior,specifically where ``1 &lt; p &lt; 2``. However, it should be possible tocalculate the distribution for all the possible values of p... image:: https://app.travis-ci.com/thequackdaddy/tweedie.svg?branch=master   :target: https://app.travis-ci.com/thequackdaddy/tweedie.. image:: http://codecov.io/github/thequackdaddy/tweedie/coverage.svg?branch=master   :target: http://codecov.io/github/thequackdaddy/tweedie?branch=masterDocumentation:  Some of the functions are well documented. Others, not so well. In future  versions, I might try to publish.Downloads:  https://github.com/thequackdaddy/tweedieDependencies:  * Python (2.7, or 3.4+)  * numpy  * scipyOptional dependencies:  * pytest: needed to run tests  * tox: needed to run tests against multiple python/scipy versionsInstall:  To run tests against multiple python/scipy versions, install the package using ``pip install -e .[dev]``.Running the tests:To test against the current python version and scipy ``pytest ./tweedie``To test against multiple python versions and scipy versions ``tox -p all``.If you run in to issues with performance, just use ``tox``.Code and bug tracker:  https://github.com/thequackdaddy/tweedieLicense:  2-clause BSD, see LICENSE.txt for details.</longdescription>
