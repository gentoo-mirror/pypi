The mainfeatures of `cmomy` are as follows:- [Numba][Numba] accelerated computation of central moments and co-moments- Routines to combine, and resample central moments.- Both [numpy][numpy] array-like and [xarray][xarray] DataArray interfaces to  Data.- Routines to convert between central and raw moments.## Overview`cmomy` is an open source package to calculate central moments and co-moments ina numerical stable and direct way. Behind the scenes, `cmomy` makes use of[Numba][Numba] to rapidly calculate moments. A good introduction to the type offormulas used can be found[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance).## Features- Fast calculation of central moments and central co-moments with weights- Support for scalar or vector inputs- numpy and xarray api's- bootstrap resampling## StatusThis package is actively used by the author. Please feel free to create a pullrequest for wanted features and suggestions!## Quick startUse one of the following```bashpip install cmomy```or```bashconda install -c wpk-nist cmomy```## Example usage```pythonimport numpy as npimport cmomyx = np.random.rand(100)m = x.mean()mom = np.array([((x - m)**i).mean() for i in range(4)])c = cmomy.CentralMoments.from_vals(x, mom=3)momOut[7]: array([1.0000e+00, 4.1633e-17, 7.3123e-02, 7.4912e-03])c.cmom()Out[8]: array([1.    , 0.    , 0.0731, 0.0075])# break up into chunksc = cmomy.CentralMoments.from_vals(x.reshape(-1, 2), mom=3)cOut[10]:&lt;CentralMoments(val_shape=(2,), mom=(3,))&gt;array([[5.0000e+01, 5.1032e-01, 6.4334e-02, 4.0363e-03],       [5.0000e+01, 4.4598e-01, 7.9842e-02, 1.2443e-02]])c.reduce(axis=0).cmom()Out[11]: array([1.    , 0.    , 0.0731, 0.0075])# unequal chunksx0, x1, x2 = x[:20], x[20:60], x[60:]cs = [cmomy.CentralMoments.from_vals(_, mom=3) for _ in (x0, x1, x2)]c = cs[0] + cs[1] + cs[2]c.cmom()Out[15]: array([1.    , 0.    , 0.0731, 0.0075])```## Note on cachingThis code makes extensive use of the numba python package. This uses a jitcompiler to speed up vital code sections. This means that the first time afunction called, it has to compile the underlying code. However, caching hasbeen implemented. Therefore, the very first time you run a function, it may beslow. But all subsequent uses (including other sessions) will be alreadycompiled.A quick way to cache (most all) the [Numba][Numba] functions is to run thetests. This can be done with```bashconda/mamba/pip install pytestpytest --pyargs cmomy```&lt;!-- end-docs --&gt;## DocumentationSee the [documentation][docs-link] for a look at `cmomy` in action.## LicenseThis is free software.
