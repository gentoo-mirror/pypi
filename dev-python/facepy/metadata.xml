To get anaccess token to consume the API on behalf of a user, use a suitable OAuth library for your platform (if you'reusing Django, for example, you might use `Fandjango &lt;https://github.com/jgorset/fandjango&gt;`_).Installation------------.. code:: bash    $ pip install facepyContribute----------* Fork `the repository &lt;http://github.com/jgorset/facepy&gt;`_.* Do your thing (preferably on a feature branch).* Write a test that demonstrates that the bug was fixed or the feature works as expected.* Send a pull request and bug me until I merge it!I love you----------Johannes Gorset made this. You should `tweet me &lt;http://twitter.com/jgorset&gt;`_ if you can't get itto work. In fact, you should tweet me anyway.I love Schibsted----------------I work at `Schibsted Products &amp; Technology &lt;https://github.com/schibsted&gt;`_ with a bunch of awesome folkswho are every bit as passionate about building things as I am. If you're usingFacepy, we probably want to hire you.</longdescription>
