	<longdescription># causal-learn: Causal Discovery for PythonCausal-learn is a python package for causal discovery that implements both classical and state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms, which is a Python translation and extension of [Tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad).The package is actively being developed. Feedbacks (issues, suggestions, etc.) are highly encouraged.# Package OverviewOur causal-learn implements methods for causal discovery:* Constraint-based causal discovery methods.* Score-based causal discovery methods.* Causal discovery methods based on constrained functional causal models.* Hidden causal representation learning.* Permutation-based causal discovery methods.* Granger causality.* Multiple utilities for building your own method, such as independence tests, score functions, graph operations, and evaluations.# InstallCausal-learn needs the following packages to be installed beforehand:* python 3* numpy* networkx* pandas* scipy* scikit-learn* statsmodels* pydot(For visualization)* matplotlib* graphvizTo use causal-learn, we could install it using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/causal-learn/):```pip install causal-learn```# DocumentationPlease kindly refer to [causal-learn Doc](https://causal-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for detailed tutorials and usages.# Running examplesFor search methods in causal discovery, there are various running examples in the **‘tests’** directory, such as TestPC.py and TestGES.py.For the implemented modules, such as (conditional) independent test methods, we provide unit tests for the convenience of developing your own methods.# BenchmarksFor the convenience of our community, [CMU-CLeaR](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/causality) group maintains a list of benchmark datasets including real-world scenarios and various learning tasks. Please refer to the following links:* [https://github.com/cmu-phil/example-causal-datasets](https://github.com/cmu-phil/example-causal-datasets) (maintained by Joseph Ramsey)* [https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/causality/projects/causal_learn_benchmarks](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/causality/projects/causal_learn_benchmarks)Please feel free to let us know if you have any recommendation regarding causal datasets with high-quality. We are grateful for any effort that benefits the development of causality community.# ContributionPlease feel free to open an issue if you find anything unexpected.And please create pull requests, perhaps after passing unittests in 'tests/', if you would like to contribute to causal-learn.We are always targeting to make our community better!</longdescription>
