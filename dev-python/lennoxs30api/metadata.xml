This API does not work for older models that use a different API.  Those models are supported by this project:  https://github.com/thevoltagesource/myicomfortPrerequistes:1. Python version 3.8.6 or later2. A Lennox sign-on (email address and password)3. You may need to install aiohttp https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/Sample program Instructions:1. Grab the repo2. Edit the test_async.py program to supply the following     LOG_PATH = '/home/pete/lennoxs30api'    #  Directoy to stash the log file in    EMAIL_ADDRESS = 'myemail@myemail.com'    PASSWORD = 'mypassword'Command Line Program Instructions:The command line program uses asyncio and runs 3 different tasks- Task 1 (runner) - this task connects to the cloud API and periodically polls it at a 10 second interval- Task 2 (poller) - this task runs on a 15 second interval and prints out information from all active Zones- Task 3 (prompt) - this task reads from the command line and executes commands on behalf of the user to enabling API testing.  Cmd List        cool, heat, off - sets the HVAC mode to cool, heat or off.  usage - just type the word followed by enter eg cool        auto, on, circulate - sets the Fan mocde to auto, on, or ciruclate        csp &lt;TempF&gt; - sets the cool setpoint in F.  example  csp 76        hsp &lt;TempF&gt; - sets the heat setpoint in F.  example hsp 65To exit the program hit crtl-c## Reporting BugsPlease enabled debug logging when reporting bugs and provide sample code.  Do not publicly post the debug logs as they contain Personally Identifiable Information that is part of the communication protocol.  Your password IS NOT in the logs, but other information such as email, home address, etc., that is part of the lennox communications is.## EnhancementsSubmit enhancement requests as issues or better yet send a pull request.</longdescription>
