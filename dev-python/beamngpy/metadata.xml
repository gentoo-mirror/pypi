Some features to highlight are:### Remote Control of VehiclesEach vehicle can be controlled individually and independently during thesimulation. This includes basic steering inputs, but also controls overvarious lights (headlights, indicators, etc.) or gear shifting.[Throttle Control.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93574498/207164528-2415691f-3aee-478e-91ae-a1a53f733ee6.webm)[Steering Control.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93574498/207164554-3f3d9478-3970-4c08-b1e3-2b656313ae33.webm)### AI-controlled VehiclesBesides manual control, BeamNG.tech ships with its own AI to control vehicles.This AI can be configured and controlled from BeamNGpy. It can be used tomake a vehicle drive to a certain waypoint, make it follow another vehicle,span the map, or follow a user-defined trajectory:![AI Trajectory](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/raw/master/media/ai_trajectory.png)### Dynamic Sensor ModelsVehicles and the environment can be equipped with various sensors that providesimulated sensor data. These sensors include: - Cameras  - Color camera  - Depth camera  - Semantic and Instance annotations - Lidars - Inertial Measurement Units - Ultrasonic Distance Measurements![Multiple cameras](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/raw/master/media/camera.png)![Lidar](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/raw/master/media/lidar.gif)These sensors give perfect data from the simulation by default. Therefore, someof them, like the camera and lidar sensor, can be equipped to also simulatenoisy data.### Access to Road Network &amp; Scenario ObjectsGeometry of roads in the currently-loaded level/scenario are made availablevia BeamNGpy. Objects and vehicles that are currently active in the sceneare also exposed, allowing for analysis of the current simulation state.![Road Network](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/raw/master/media/road_network.png)### Multiple ClientsBeamNGpy interacts with BeamNG.tech as the client, with BeamNG.tech actingas the server. This allows for multiple BeamNGpy processes to connect to arunning simulation and have each control the simulator, making it possibleto, for example, [run a scenario in which each vehicle is controlled bya separate client.](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/tree/master/examples/multi_client.ipynb)### MoreThere is a healthy collection of usage examples in the [examples/](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/tree/master/examples)folder of this repository. These highlight more features, but also serveas documentation, so be sure to check them out.&lt;a name=&quot;prereqs&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;## PrerequisitesUsage of BeamNGpy requires BeamNG.tech to be installed. Builds ofBeamNG.tech are made available for non-commercial use upon request using[this form][2]. For commercial use, contact us at [licensing@beamng.gmbh][3].Once downloaded, you can use the environment variable `BNG_HOME` to whereBeamNG.tech can be run from, or provide a path to the BeamNGpy libraryduring initialization.The regular [Steam release of BeamNG.drive][4] is compatible to an extent aswell. Certain sensors like the simulated LiDAR or camera will not work, butmost of the functions that are not exclusive to a Tech build will likelywork.&lt;a name=&quot;installation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;## InstallationThe library itself is available on [PyPI][5] and can therefore be installedusing common methods like `pip`:    pip install beamngpyIf you use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#download-section), you caninstall BeamNGpy from the `conda-forge` channel by:    conda install beamngpy -c conda-forgeTo upgrade, use    pip install --upgrade beamngpyif you installed BeamNGpy using `pip` or    conda update beamngpy -c conda-forge --no-pinif you installed it using `conda`.&lt;a name=&quot;usage&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;## Usage**DISCLAIMER:** If you are using an older version of `beamngpy` and BeamNG.tech, please follow theinstructions of the corresponding `README` file (for example, [1.22 instructions](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/tree/v1.22)).The library can be imported using `import beamngpy`. A shortusage example setting up a scenario with one vehicle in the West Coast USA mapthat spans the area is:```pythonfrom beamngpy import BeamNGpy, Scenario, Vehicle# Instantiate BeamNGpy instance running the simulator from the given path,# communicating over localhost:64256bng = BeamNGpy('localhost', 64256, home='/path/to/bng/tech', user='/path/to/bng/tech/userfolder')# Launch BeamNG.techbng.open()# Create a scenario in west_coast_usa called 'example'scenario = Scenario('west_coast_usa', 'example')# Create an ETK800 with the licence plate 'PYTHON'vehicle = Vehicle('ego_vehicle', model='etk800', license='PYTHON')# Add it to our scenario at this position and rotationscenario.add_vehicle(vehicle, pos=(-717, 101, 118), rot_quat=(0, 0, 0.3826834, 0.9238795))# Place files defining our scenario for the simulator to readscenario.make(bng)# Load and start our scenariobng.scenario.load(scenario)bng.scenario.start()# Make the vehicle's AI span the mapvehicle.ai.set_mode('span')input('Hit enter when done...')```We have a [guide][6] helping you getting started and navigating our collection of examples andthe documentation of the library is available [here][7].## CompatibilityBeamNG.tech is not a finished product but is still under development.Thus frequent changes on the simulation side are to be expected.While the BeamNGpy library maintains compatibility between minor versions for the user, this doesn't extend to the BeamNG.tech side. Not all BeamNGpy versions are compatible with all BeamNG.tech versions.Below is a list of compatible BeamNG.tech and BeamNGpy versions.However we do not maintain minor versions: bug fixes and new features will only be available for the newest BeamNG.tech and BeamNGpy releases.| BeamNG.tech version | BeamNGpy version                                          || ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- || 0.28, 0.29          | [1.26.1](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/tree/v1.26.1) || 0.27                | [1.25.1](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/tree/v1.25.1) || 0.26                | [1.24](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/tree/v1.24)     || 0.25                | [1.23.1](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/tree/v1.23.1) || 0.24                | [1.22](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/tree/v1.22)     || 0.23                | [1.21.1](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/tree/v1.21.1) || 0.22                | [1.20](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/tree/v1.20)     || 0.21                | [1.19.1](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/tree/v1.19.1) |## TroubleshootingThis section lists common issues with BeamNGpy in particular. Since thislibrary is closely tied to BeamNG.tech and thus BeamNG.drive, it is alsorecommended to consult the documentation on BeamNG.drive here:[https://documentation.beamng.com/][8]### BeamNGpy cannot establish a connection - Be sure to complete the initial set up step described in the Usage section and to repeat it with every newly released BeamNG.tech version. - Make sure BeamNG.tech and Python are allowed to connect to your current   network in Windows Firewall.### BeamNG.tech quietly fails to launch- There is a known issue where BeamNG.tech quietly crashes when there is a  space in the configured userpath. Until this issue is fixed, it is  recommended to either switch to a path that does not contain a space or  change the userpath directly in the &quot;startup.ini&quot; file located in the  directory of your BeamNG.tech installation.## ContributionsWe always welcome user contributions, be sure to check out our [contribution guidelines][9] first, before starting your work.[1]: https://beamngpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[2]: https://register.beamng.tech/[3]: mailto:licensing@beamng.gmbh[4]: https://store.steampowered.com/app/284160/BeamNGdrive/[5]: https://pypi.org/project/beamngpy/[6]: https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/blob/master/examples/README.md[7]: https://beamngpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[8]: https://documentation.beamng.com/[9]: https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/blob/master/contributing.md[10]: https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/blob/master/examples/feature_overview.ipynb[11]: https://beamng.tech/</longdescription>
