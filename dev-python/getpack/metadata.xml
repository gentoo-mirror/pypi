	<longdescription>### Declarative external resources any with implicit deploymentThis package provide classes that allow to setup external resources (utilities,python packages etc.) that will be deployed as they are used. In mostcases data should be on the web and it will be deployed and cached locally ononly first usage.There are several examples in `test/` folder and `getpack.library` modulealready defined and useable. But main intention is to provide framework fordeclarative setup of any resource and work with it without care of deployment.```pythonfrom getpack.resource import WebResourceclass Example(WebResource):    version = '0.1'    archive_url = 'https://example.com/example-0.1.zip'```then it would be used:```pythonimport subprocesssubprocess.call(Example()().path / 'example.exe')```Second round braces required to actually make an effect from resourceand first round braces used to initialize resource class, that would produceresource descriptions on the fly like follows:```pythonExample(version='0.2', archive_url='https://Example.com/example-0.2.zip')```You may experiment with following working snippet and try to change `PySide2`version:```bashpython -c &quot;import getpack.library;getpack.library.PySide2(version='5.14.1')(); import PySide2.QtWidgets; app=PySide2.QtWidgets.QApplication(); w=PySide2.QtWidgets.QPushButton(PySide2.__version__); w.clicked.connect(w.close); w.show(); app.exec_()&quot;```### TODO- Utilize `requirements.txt` to reproduce both development and production  environments.</longdescription>
