For example, you mightallow the user to indicate whether they are using a public or private computerand implement different policies for each. Or you might be using a two-factorauthentication scheme, allowing the users to bypass the second factor onmachines that they designate as trusted. This uses Django's signed cookiefacility and operates independently of sessions.Short list of features:    - ``request.agent.is_trusted`` tells you whether the request came from a      trusted agent.    - APIs to trust or revoke the agent that made a given request.    - Global, per-user, and per-agent settings can set the duration of agent      trust as well as an inactivity timeout.    - Supports session-scoped agent trust for consistency of authorization      policies.    - Revoke all of a user's previously trusted agents at any time.The mechanisms by which a user is allowed to designate trusted agents is leftentirely to clients of this library. For an application of this API usingone-time passwords, see `django-otp-agents&lt;https://pypi.org/project/django-otp-agents&gt;`_, part of the `django-otp&lt;https://pypi.org/project/django-otp&gt;`_ suite.</longdescription>
