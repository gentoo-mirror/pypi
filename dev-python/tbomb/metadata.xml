For obsolete versions of Python (eg 2.7), use discretion while executing the script as it has not been tested there.## Features- Over 15 integrated messaging and calling APIs included with JSON- Unlimited (with abuse protection) and super-fast bombing with multithreading- Possibility of international API support (APIs are offline)- Flexible with addition of newer APIs with the help of JSON documents- Actively supported by the developers with frequent updates and bug-fixes- Intuitive auto-update feature and notification fetch feature included- Recently made free and open-source for community contributions- Modular codebase and snippets can be easily embedded in other program## Usage:### Install by PIP (Recommended)Before continuing make sure following requirements are satisfied:- Python version greater than or equal to 3.4 is installed- pip is installed for Python 3Install `tbomb` package by running:```shell scriptpip3 install tbomb```Run TBomb by just typing:```shell scripttbomb```### Install from GIT#### NOTE Git installation methods are not universal and are likely to differ between distributions so installing Git as per the given instructions below may not work.

If you are ready to help then maybe we can do faster.```- Why is the limit so low?```Due the amount of requests, the APIs can die.

Proxy's? ```No, TBomb can fail due the high response time or API restrictions.```- Protection ?```Use OTP Blockers and activate DND.```- Call Bombing does not work!``` It does only work for indian numbers. Other Country's are not supported yet.```Last Update: 15.05.2021</longdescription>
