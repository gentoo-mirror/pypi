	<longdescription># Manim-Code-Blocks`Manim-Code-Blocks` is a library for [Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) that allows animating blocks of code in Manim videos and scenes. ## Example Usage```pythonfrom manim import *from manim_code_blocks import *class Main(Scene):    def construct(self):        java = CodeBlock(            &quot;&quot;&quot;            public class Main {                public static void main(String[] args) {                    System.out.println(&quot;Hello world&quot;);                }            }            &quot;&quot;&quot;,            language = Java        )        self.play(*java.create(run_time = 3))```Outputs:&lt;br&gt;![](assets/java_demo.gif)## Problems &amp; Limitations### Limited Language SupportCurrently only the following languages are supported for syntax highlighting:- C- C#- C++- Java- JavaScript- Lua- Go- Python- Rust- TypeScriptTo add language support, submit a pull request to to the [Tokenize-All](https://github.com/NicholasIapalucci/Tokenize-All) module.### Unintelligent Highlighting`Manim-Code-Block` uses *syntax* highlighting, not *semantic* highlighting. The source code is only tokenized, not parsed, and as such accurate highlighting can be impossible for certain circumstances. Syntax highlighting is provided by the [Tokenize-All](https://github.com/NicholasIapalucci/Tokenize-All) module, which lacks thorough language support. Additionally many languages have not been thoroughly tested enough for accurate highlighting. If you find an issue in your syntax highlighting, please report it to [the issues thread](https://github.com/NicholasIapalucci/manim-code-blocks/issues).### Lack of ThemesCurrently the only theme supported out of the box is the [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) theme from Atom and used in Visual Studio Code. Adding a custom theme is possible (and simple), however currently this is the only theme supported out of the box.</longdescription>
