	<longdescription>``pcg_gazebo``: A Python package for rapid-prototyping and scripting of simulations for Gazebo==============================================================================================|Python application| |Discord| |GitHub issues| |License| |PyPI| |PyPI -Python Version|The ``pcg_gazebo`` Python package is an Open Source Project extendingthe simulation capabilities of the robotics simulator`Gazebo &lt;http://gazebosim.org/&gt;`__ for automation and scripting ofGazebo simulations.Visit the `documentationpage &lt;https://boschresearch.github.io/pcg_gazebo/&gt;`__ for moreinformation.Purpose of the project----------------------This software is a research prototype.The software is not ready for production use. It has neither beendeveloped nor tested for a specific use case. However, the licenseconditions of the applicable Open Source licenses allow you to adapt thesoftware to your needs. Before using it in a safety relevant setting,make sure that the software fulfills your requirements and adjust itaccording to any applicable safety standards (e.g.Â ISO 26262).Installation------------Using ``pip``~~~~~~~~~~~~~You can install the ``pcg-gazebo`` package using ``pip`` as follows.. code:: bash   pip install pcg-gazeboyou still might need to install some extra dependencies that cannot behandled by ``pip`` as::   sudo apt install libspatialindex-dev pybind11-dev libgeos-devGive some issues with the package ``rtree`` on ``pip``, it would also berecommended to install it from ``apt``. Please install ``python-rtree``if you are using Python 2.x or ``python3-rtree`` for Python 3.x.   The default installation does not include ``rospy`` dependencies that   are not available as a ``pip`` package. They have to be installed   separately for certain submodules to work, such as   ``pcg_gazebo.task_manager``.From source~~~~~~~~~~~First install some non-Python dependencies::   sudo apt install libspatialindex-dev pybind11-dev libgeos-dev libfcl-dev liboctomap-devThen clone the repository and install it using ``pip``::   git clone https://github.com/boschresearch/pcg_gazebo.git   cd pcg_gazebo   pip install .Using the package with ROS and Gazebo~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Certain functionalities as the Gazebo proxy, task manager and modelspawning are only available if ``rospy`` is installed. The lack ofGazebo and ``rospy`` only restricts functionalities related tointeraction with the simulation in runtime and the creation ofROS-related tasks.At the moment, ROS 2 is **not** supported for this purpose. To installROS ``melodic``, follow these `installationinstructions &lt;https://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu&gt;`__ andinstall ``ros-melodic-desktop-full`` or separately install Gazebo andits ROS bindings as::   sudo apt install gazebo9 libgazebo9-dev ros-melodic-gazebo-*License-------Procedural Generation for Gazebo is open-sourced under the Apache-2.0license.
