	<longdescription>dd is a package for working with binary decision diagrams that includes both a pure Python implementation and Cython bindings to C libraries (CUDD, Sylvan, BuDDy). The Python and Cython modules implement the same API, so the same user code runs with both. All the standard operations on BDDs are available, including dynamic variable reordering using sifting, garbage collection, dump/load from files, plotting, and a parser of quantified Boolean expressions. More details can be found in the README at: https://github.com/tulip-control/dd</longdescription>
