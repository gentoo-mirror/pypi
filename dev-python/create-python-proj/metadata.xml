It sets up the project structure, initializes a Git repository, configures the best development tools: [**mypy**](https://github.com/python/mypy), [**black**](https://github.com/psf/black), [**flake8**](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8), [**isort**](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/), [**pytest**](https://docs.pytest.org/), and adds the best configurations for these tools.To create a new project, simply install using `pipx`:```bashpipx install create-python-proj```Then run the tool:```bashcreate-python-proj```You will be prompted for the project name and a new directory with the project structure and configurations will be created.If you don't have `pipx` installed, you can install it with:```bashpython3 -m pip install --user pipx```([`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) is a Python package runner tool for running https://pypi.org/ packages)`create-python-proj` will create a directory called my-proj inside the current folder.&lt;br&gt;Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:```my-proj├── pyproject.toml├── poetry.lock├── README.md├── .gitignore├── .flake8├── .venv│   └── ...local Python virtual environment├── my-proj│   ├── __init__.py│   └── main.py└── tests    ├── __init__.py    └── test_example.py```No configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your project.Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder and activate the local virtual environment, managed by Poetry:```bashcd my-projpoetry shell```Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:### `poetry run my-proj`Runs the starter &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program.### `pytest`Runs the starter `test_example` test.### `exit`Deactivate the local virtual environment when you are finished working with the project.## What's Included?Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern Python project, with all tools already configured to work together seemlessly:- [**Poetry**](https://python-poetry.org/docs/): a standalone, all-in-one package and dependency management tool for Python projects that simplifies dependency installation, package building, and publishing. It uses a pyproject.toml file to define project metadata and dependencies, streamlining the entire packaging process and making it easy to manage complex dependency trees.- [**mypy**](https://github.com/python/mypy): a static type checker for Python that helps catch potential type errors and improve code readability by enforcing type annotations. It uses gradual typing to provide immediate benefits without requiring a full conversion to static typing.- [**black**](https://github.com/psf/black): an opinionated code formatter for Python that enforces a consistent style across your codebase by automatically reformatting code to comply with the PEP 8 style guide. By focusing on deterministic formatting rules, it minimizes debates over code style and allows developers to concentrate on writing code.- [**flake8**](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8): a Python linter that checks for style guide violations, programming errors, and potential issues in your code. It combines the functionality of PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and McCabe complexity analysis, providing a comprehensive code quality analysis tool.- [**isort**](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/): a Python utility that automatically sorts and organizes your imports according to the PEP 8 style guide or a custom configuration. It streamlines import management and ensures a consistent import style throughout your project.- [**pytest**](https://docs.pytest.org/): a powerful and flexible testing framework for Python that simplifies the process of writing and running tests. It supports a wide range of test types, including unit tests, functional tests, and integration tests, and offers advanced features such as fixtures, parameterization, and plugins to extend its functionality.## RecommendationsEnable automatically running **black** formatting, **mypy** type checking, **flake8** linting, **isort** imports organizing, and `pyproject.toml` formatting on every save in VS Code:- Install the [Black Formatter VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter).- Install the [mypy VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matangover.mypy).- Install the [isort VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.isort).- Install the [Even Better TOML VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml).and add these configs to your user `settings.json` file:```json// PYTHON  &quot;[python]&quot;: {    &quot;editor.formatOnSave&quot;: true,    &quot;editor.defaultFormatter&quot;: &quot;ms-python.black-formatter&quot;,    &quot;editor.insertSpaces&quot;: true,    &quot;editor.tabSize&quot;: 4,    &quot;editor.codeActionsOnSave&quot;: {      &quot;source.organizeImports&quot;: true    }  },  &quot;python.linting.enabled&quot;: true,  &quot;python.linting.flake8Enabled&quot;: true,  &quot;python.linting.flake8Path&quot;: &quot;flake8&quot;,  &quot;python.linting.mypyEnabled&quot;: true,  // TOML  &quot;[toml]&quot;: {    &quot;editor.defaultFormatter&quot;: &quot;tamasfe.even-better-toml&quot;,    &quot;editor.formatOnSave&quot;: true  },  &quot;evenBetterToml.formatter.allowedBlankLines&quot;: 1,  &quot;evenBetterToml.formatter.columnWidth&quot;: 88,```## ContributingContributions to Create-Python-Proj are welcome.
