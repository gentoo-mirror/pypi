	<longdescription># Carburetor[![Translation status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/carburetor/-/translations/svg-badge.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/carburetor/?utm_source=widget)This is a graphical settings app for tractor which is a package uses Python stem library to provide a connection through the onion proxy and sets up proxy in user session, so you don't have to mess up with TOR on your system anymore. ## InstallOn Ubuntu based distros, make sure that you have `software-properties-common` package installed an then do as following:    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tractor-team/tractor    sudo apt update    sudo apt install carburetorIf you are using a distro other than Ubuntu, please check if the release name in the relevant file located in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` is a supported one (e.g. jammy).On Debian systems you may use up to the `hirsute` channel binaries, since it doesn't support the new compression algorithm. May be I try to setup a CI/CD pipeline for releasing Debian .debs.For othe distros, the recommended method is by using [Python package index](https://pypi.org/project/carburetor/). However anyone is welcome in contributing native package build recepies for their distribution.## Runyou can run `carburetor` by command line or through your desktop environment.</longdescription>
