	<longdescription>Free Python Games=================`Free Python Games`_ is an Apache2 licensed collection of free Python gamesintended for education and fun. The games are written in simple Python code anddesigned for experimentation and changes. Simplified versions of severalclassic arcade games are included.Python is one of the top-five most popular programming languages in the worldand available for free from `Python.org &lt;https://www.python.org/&gt;`_. Pythonincludes an extensive Standard Library distributed with your installation. TheStandard Library has a module called Turtle which is a popular way to introduceprogramming to kids. Turtle was part of the original Logo programming languagedeveloped by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966. All of the games in`Free Python Games`_ are implemented using Python and its Turtle module.Starting in 2012, `Free Python Games`_ began as an after school program toteach programming to inner-city youth. The goal was to have fun as much as itwas to learn. Since then the games have been improved and used in a variety ofsettings ranging from classrooms to summer day-camps.The games run anywhere Python can be installed which includes desktop computersrunning Windows, Mac OS, or Linux and older or low-power hardware such as theRaspberry Pi. Kids across the United States in grades 6th-12th have enjoyedlearning about topics such as encryption and projectile motion through games.Each game is entirely independent from the others and includes comments alongwith a list of exercises to work through with students. Creativity andflexibility is important. There is no right or wrong way to implement a newfeature or behavior! You never know which games students will engage with best... _`Free Python Games`: https://grantjenks.com/docs/freegames/Testimonials------------*&quot;I love Free Python Games because the games are fun and they're easy tounderstand and change. I like making my own games now.&quot;*-- Luke Martin, Student*&quot;Free Python Games inspired and introduced a new hobby to our son. Thank you somuch for exposing him to coding. He is having so much fun!&quot;*-- Mary Lai, Parent*&quot;Free Python Games are great because they really engage students and let themlearn at their own pace.&quot;*-- Rick Schertle, Teacher, Steindorf STEAM School*&quot;Free Python Games combines play and learning in a flexible environment thatreduces the stress of a difficult topic like programming.&quot;*-- Brett Bymaster, Youth Pastor, The River Church Community*&quot;Free Python Games is great for students, is highly organized and flexible,and seeks to unleash inquiry and understanding.&quot;*-- Terri Furton, Principal, Downtown College PrepFeatures--------- Fun to play!- Simple Python code- Easy to install- Designed for education- Depends only on the Python Standard Library- Used in hundreds of hours of classroom instruction- Fully Documented- 100% Test Coverage- Developed on Python 3.10- Tested on CPython 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10- Tested on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows- Tested using GitHub Actions.. image:: https://github.com/grantjenks/free-python-games/workflows/integration/badge.svg   :target: https://grantjenks.com/docs/freegames/Quickstart----------Installing Free Python Games is simple with `pip&lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip&gt;`_::  $ python3 -m pip install freegamesFree Python Games supports a command-line interface (CLI). Help for the CLI isavailable using::  $ python3 -m freegames --helpThe CLI supports three commands: list, copy, and show. For a list of all gamesrun::  $ python3 -m freegames listAny of the listed games may be played by executing the Python module from thecommand-line. To reference the Python module, combine &quot;freegames&quot; with the nameof the game. For example, to play the &quot;snake&quot; game run::  $ python3 -m freegames.snakeGames can be modified by copying their source code. The copy command willcreate a Python file in your local directory which you can edit. For example,to copy and play the &quot;snake&quot; game run::  $ python3 -m freegames copy snake  $ python3 snake.pyPython includes a built-in text editor named IDLE which can also execute Pythoncode. To launch the editor and make changes to the &quot;snake&quot; game run::  $ python3 -m idlelib.idle snake.pyYou can also access documentation in the interpreter with Python's built-inhelp function::  &gt;&gt;&gt; import freegames  &gt;&gt;&gt; help(freegames)Free Python Games also provides an entry-point script for compatibility with`pipx &lt;https://pypa.github.io/pipx/&gt;`_::  $ pipx install freegames  $ freegames play lifeFree Games----------Paint.....`Paint`_ -- draw lines and shapes on the screen.
