See the documentation there for general information.Stay in sync============In order to always stay in sync with the upstream sphinx_rtd_theme_, this repository contains two remotes: ``upstream`` and ``origin``.See Github's `syncing a fork`_ article for more information.Installation============Via package-----------Download the package or add it to your ``requirements.txt`` file:.. code:: bash    $ pip install rtcat_sphinx_themeIn your ``conf.py`` file:.. code:: python    import rtcat_sphinx_theme    html_theme = &quot;rtcat_sphinx_theme&quot;    html_theme_path = [rtcat_sphinx_theme.get_html_theme_path()]Via git or download-------------------Symlink or submodule/subtree the ``RTCat/rtcat_sphinx_theme`` repository into your documentation at``docs/_themes/rtcat_sphinx_theme`` then add the following two settings to your Sphinxconf.py file:.. code:: python    html_theme = &quot;rtcat_sphinx_theme&quot;    html_theme_path = [&quot;_themes/rtcat_sphinx_theme&quot;, ]Editing=======The rtcat_sphinx_theme is primarily a sass_ project that requires a few other sass libraries. I'musing bower_ to manage these dependencies and sass_ to build the css. The good news isI have a very nice set of grunt_ operations that will not only load these dependencies, but watchfor changes, rebuild the sphinx demo docs and build a distributable version of the theme.The bad news is this means you'll need to set up your environment similar to thatof a front-end developer (vs. that of a python developer). That means installing node and ruby.Set up your environment-----------------------1. Install sphinx_ into a virtual environment... code::    virtualenv ve    source ve/bin/activate    pip install sphinx2. Install sass.. code::    gem install sass2. Install node, bower and grunt... code::    // Install bower and grunt    npm install -g bower grunt-cli    // Now that everything is installed, let's install the theme dependecies.    npm installNow that our environment is set up, make sure you're in your virtual environment, go tothis repository in your terminal and run grunt:.. code::    gruntThis default task will do the following **very cool things that make it worth the trouble**.1. It'll install and update any bower dependencies.2. It'll run sphinx and build new docs.3. It'll watch for changes to the sass files and build css from the changes.4. It'll rebuild the sphinx docs anytime it notices a change to .rst, .html, .js   or .css files.</longdescription>
