Although pysat was initiallydesigned for in situ satellite observations, it now supports many differenttypes of ground- and space-based measurements.Full [Documentation](http://pysat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)JGR-Space Physics [Publication](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JA025297)[Citation Info](https://pysat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/citing.html)Come join us on Slack! An invitation to the pysat workspace is available in the 'About' section of the [pysat GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/pysat/pysat)Development meetings are generally held fortnightly.# Main Features* Instrument independent analysis routines.* Instrument object providing an interface for downloading and analyzing a wide  variety of science data sets.  * Uses pandas or xarray for the underlying data structure;    capable of handling the many forms scientific measurements take in a    consistent manner.  * Standard scientific data handling tasks (e.g., identifying, downloading,    and loading files and cleaning and modifying data) are built into the    Instrument object.  * Supports metadata consistent with the netCDF CF-1.6 standard. Each variable    has a name, long name, and units. Note units are informational only.* Simplifies data management  * Iterator support for loading data by day/file/orbit, independent of data    storage details.  * Orbits are calculated on the fly from loaded data and span day breaks.  * Iterate over custom seasons* Supports rigorous time-series calculations that require spin up/down time  across day, orbit, and file breaks.* Includes helper functions to reduce the barrier in adding new science  instruments to pysat# Installation## Starting from scratch* Python and associated packages for science are freely available. Convenient  science python package setups are available from https://www.python.org/,  [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), and other locations  (some platform specific). Anaconda also includes a developer environment that  works well with pysat. Core science packages such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib,  pandas and many others may also be installed directly via pip or your  favorite package manager.* Installation through pip```pip install pysat```* Installation through github```git clone https://github.com/pysat/pysat.gitcd pysatpython setup.py install```An advantage to installing through github is access to the development branches.The latest bugfixes can be found in the `develop` branch.  However, this branchis not stable (as the name implies).  We recommend using this branch in avirtual environment or using `python setup.py develop`.```git clone https://github.com/pysat/pysat.gitcd pysatgit checkout developpython setup.py develop```* Note that pysat requires a number of packages for the install.    * dask  * netCDF4  * numpy  * pandas  * portalocker  * scipy  * toolz  * xarray* The first time the package is run, you will need to specify a directory to  store data. In python, run:```pysat.params['data_dirs'] = 'path/to/directory/that/may/or/may/not/exist'```  * Nominal organization of data is top_dir/platform/name/tag/inst_id/files</longdescription>
