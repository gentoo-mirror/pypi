	<longdescription>How does it work?=================This plugin inspects import statements for configured packages. Both checkers are using powerful AST analysis techniques, standard for pylint.Status======This emerged as a standalone experimentation during development of `the Clean Architecture example project`_Why?====To enforce certain conventions project-wide in an automatic way, without having to watch for it during code review. For example: &quot;we do not import anything from `foo` in `bar`.&quot; or &quot;we must not import anything from guts of the package `baz`, only what's kept in it's top-level __init__.py `__all__` list&quot;.How to use it?==============After installing a package just run `pylint`, appending `pylint_forbidden_imports` to your `--load-plugins` option.An example::    pylint my_cool_project --load-plugins=pylint_forbidden_importsor append it to your `pylintrc` file::    [MASTER]    load-plugins=pylint_forbidden_importsThen, you have to configure the plugin. Example for `.pylintrc`::    [ARBITRARY-SECTION-NAME]    encapsulated-modules=auctions,payments    encapsulated-modules-friendships=auctions_infrastructure-&gt;auctions    allowed-modules-dependencies=auctions_infrastructure-&gt;auctions,                                 main-&gt;*,                                 *-&gt;foundation,All settings are comma-separated. `encapsulated-modules` - checks whether we import from it only things kept in top-level __init__.py.`encapsulated-modules-friendships` - allows for creating exceptions to that rule for &quot;friend&quot; packages.`allowed-modules-dependencies` - defines which packages are allowed to be imported from certain packages. Asterisk (*) is a wildcard - `main-&gt;*`  means main package can import anything while `*-&gt;foundation` means that any package can import from foundation.If a certain package does not appear at least once, no rules are enforced.Development===========Install dev dependencies: ::    pip install -e .[dev].. _the Clean Architecture example project: https://github.com/Enforcer/clean-architecture</longdescription>
