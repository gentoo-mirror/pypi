	<longdescription># gc  `gc` is a simple command line helper client for git.  Obviously git has a lot of functionality in the CLI already. Not seeking to re-invent any wheels, `gc` can simplify commits and pushes, add or remove files from .gitignore, and maybe one day help with merge fixes.  ### usage  `$ gc &quot;subject for a git commit&quot;`  **Commit local git repo with message &quot;subject for a git commit&quot;, add or rm files, and push changes.** You will be prompted to add a body message (skip with 'n'), and you will see a list of untracked, modified, or deleted files. Simply unselect any files you DON'T want to add or rm.  `$ gc -I`  **show .gitignore for current project and exit**  `$ gc -i config.ini terraform.tfvars`  **add `config.ini` and `terraform.tfvars` to project's .gitignore.** If a file exists already, it will be deleted, but you will be prompted first (unless you provide the [-y] or [--yes] flag).  </longdescription>
