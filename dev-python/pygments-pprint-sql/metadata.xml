	<longdescription>SQL Pretty Printer for Pygments===============================Use this Pygments plugin alongside your usual SQL lexer and any outputformatter to have your SQL queries reformatted for improved readability.This filter modifies the stream of tokens that Pygments produces byinserting whitespace at key points to make the structure of the querymore obvious.Usage-----For programmatic usage, add the filter to your lexer before highlighting::    from pygments import highlight, lexers, formatters    from pygments_pprint_sql import SqlFilter    lexer = lexers.MySqlLexer()    lexer.add_filter(SqlFilter())    print highlight(text, lexer, formatters.TerminalFormatter())This plugin is also compatible with the pygmentize CLI tool, via the -F option::    pygmentize -F pprint-sql script.sqlNotes-----DDL statements like CREATE and ALTER are left unformatted because formattingthem reliably would be a significant undertaking, especially for all flavoursof SQL.I've done my testing with queries from an application I work on thatuses MySQL. In general it should transfer nicely to other RDBMS but Ican make no guarantees.Patches always welcome, provided they come with test cases!Alternatives------------  * `SQLParse`_ is a standalone parser and formatter package with some nice    options for customizing how formatting occurs... _SQLParse: https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse</longdescription>
