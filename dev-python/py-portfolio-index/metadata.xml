	<longdescription>## Py Portfolio Index`py-portfolio-index` is a python library to make it easier to mantain a broad, index-based approach to stock investing while being able to layer in person preferences, such as to exclude or reweight certain kinds of stocks. For example, a user could construct a portfolio that matches the composition of the S&amp;P 500, but excludes oil companies and overweights semiconductor companies.To do that, it provides tools for constructing and managing portfolios that are modeled off indexes. These idealportfolios can be efficiently converted into actual portfolios by API, using commission free platforms like Robinhood or Alpaca. Since constructing an index analogue typically requires many small stock purchases, acommission free platform is important to minimizing overhead. For small investment sizes, the ability of the platform to support fractional shares is critical to being able to accurately map to the index.## Indexespy-portfolio-index contains a default set of indexes, which can be access via the INDEXES dictionary: `from py_portfolio_index import INDEXES`. These indexes are based on the common industry index cuts such as Large Cap or real-estate and are updated quarterly.## Lists/Themespy-portfolio-index also contains a default list of stock lists, which can be access via the STOCK_LISTS dictionary: `from py_portfolio_index import STOCK_LISTS`. These lists are thematic groupings, such as by industry (space)or by other criteria (vice). Lists can be applied to modify indexes or reweight them to create customizedportfolios. #### InstallThe package supports Python 3.9 plus.`pip install py-portfolio-index`#### ConsiderationsSome providers may take some time to place an order. Keep this in mind when running repeated rebalances, as theportfolio balance may not have updated to reflect your last order.Also remember that the stock markets are not always open!#### Basic ExampleThis example shows a basic example using the Alpaca API in paper trading mode.It constructs an ideal portfolio based on the composition of the Vanguard ESG index fund in Q4 2020, then uses theAlpaca API to construct a matching portfolio based on an initial investment of 10000 dollars.```pythonfrom py_portfolio_index import INDEXES, STOCK_LISTS, Logger, AlpacaProvider, PurchaseStrategy, generate_order_planfrom logging import INFO, StreamHandlerLogger.addHandler(StreamHandler())Logger.setLevel(INFO)# The size of our paper portfolioTARGET_PORTFOLIO_SIZE = 10000# instantiate the Alpaca provider with identity information# and set it to use the paper provider# this expects the environment variables ALPACA_API_KEY and ALPACA_API_SECRET to be set,# or they can be passed in directly, using AlpacaProvider(key_id=..., secret_key=...)provider = AlpacaProvider()# get an example index # this one is the vanguard ESG index for Q4 202ideal_portfolio = INDEXES['esgv_2020_q4']# exclude all stocks from the oil, vice, and cruise listsideal_portfolio.exclude(STOCK_LISTS['oil']).exclude(STOCK_LISTS['vice']).exclude(STOCK_LISTS['cruises'])# double the weighting of stocks in the renewable and semiconductor lists, and set them to a minimum weight of .1%ideal_portfolio.reweight(STOCK_LISTS['renewable'], weight=2.0, min_weight=.001)ideal_portfolio.reweight(STOCK_LISTS['semiconductor'], weight=2.0, min_weight=.001)# get actual holdingsreal_port = provider.get_holdings()# compare actual holdings to this ideal portfolio to produce a buy and sell listplanned_orders = generate_order_plan(ideal=ideal_portfolio, real=real_port,                                     buy_order=PurchaseStrategy.LARGEST_DIFF_FIRST,                                     target_size=TARGET_PORTFOLIO_SIZE)# review the ordersfor item in planned_orders.to_buy:    print(item)# purchase the buy listprovider.purchase_order_plan(plan = planned_orders, fractional_shares=False, skip_errored_stocks=False)```### RobinhoodRobinhood has a less reliable API, but it is also commission free and supports fractional shares.```pythonfrom py_portfolio_index.bin import INDEXES, STOCK_LISTSfrom py_portfolio_index.enums import PurchaseStrategyfrom py_portfolio_index.operators import compare_portfoliosfrom py_portfolio_index.portfolio_providers.robinhood import RobinhoodProviderfrom py_portfolio_index.constants import Loggerfrom logging import INFO, StreamHandlerLogger.addHandler(StreamHandler())Logger.setLevel(INFO)ideal_port = INDEXES['esgv_2020_q4']# create a stock listSTOCK_LISTS.add_list('manual_override', ['MDLZ'])# modify the indexideal_port.exclude(STOCK_LISTS['oil']).exclude(STOCK_LISTS['vice']).exclude(STOCK_LISTS['cruises']).exclude(    STOCK_LISTS['manual_override'])# overweight on stonksideal_port.reweight(STOCK_LISTS['renewable'], weight=2.0, min_weight=.001)ideal_port.reweight(STOCK_LISTS['semiconductor'], weight=2.0, min_weight=.001)provider = RobinhoodProvider(username='#####', password='#########')real_port = provider.get_holdings()TARGET_SIZE = 10000planned_orders = generate_order_plan(ideal=ideal_portfolio, real=real_port,                                     buy_order=PurchaseStrategy.LARGEST_DIFF_FIRST,                                     target_size=TARGET_PORTFOLIO_SIZE)# review the ordersfor item in planned_orders.to_buy:    print(item)# purchase the buy listprovider.purchase_order_plan(plan = planned_orders, fractional_shares=False, skip_errored_stocks=False)```### TestingTo avoid actually purchasing a stock, use the plan_only option to log what trades would have occurred.```pythonprovider.purchase_order_plan(plan = planned_orders, plan_only=True )```### Example ScriptsCan be found in the examples folder.### LoggingIt can be helpful to configure the logger to print messages. You can either configure the standard python logger or use the portfolio specific one using an example like the below.```pythonfrom py_portfolio_index.constants import Loggerfrom logging import INFO, StreamHandlerLogger.addHandler(StreamHandler())Logger.setLevel(INFO)```</longdescription>
