	<longdescription>## AWS CRT Python[![Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/awscrt.svg?style=flat)](https://pypi.org/project/awscrt/)Python 3 bindings for the AWS Common Runtime.*   [API documentation](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-crt-python)*   [Development guide](guides/dev/README.md) for contributors to aws-crt-python's source code.## LicenseThis library is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.## Minimum Requirements:*   Python 3.7+## InstallationTo install from pip:```bashpython3 -m pip install awscrt```To install from Github:```bashgit clone https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-python.gitcd aws-crt-pythongit submodule update --initpython3 -m pip install .```To use from your Python application, declare `awscrt` as a dependency in your `setup.py` file.### OpenSSL and LibCrypto (Unix only)aws-crt-python does not use OpenSSL for TLS.On Apple and Windows devices, the OS's default TLS library is used.On Unix devices, [s2n-tls](https://github.com/aws/s2n-tls) is used.But s2n-tls uses libcrypto, the cryptography math library bundled with OpenSSL.To simplify installation, aws-crt-python has its own copy of libcrypto.This lets you install a wheel from PyPI without having OpenSSL installed.Unix wheels on PyPI come with libcrypto statically compiled in.Code to build libcrypto comes from [AWS-LC](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc).AWS-LC's code is included in the PyPI source package, and the git repository includes it as a submodule.If you need aws-crt-python to use the libcrypto included on your system, set environment variable `AWS_CRT_BUILD_USE_SYSTEM_LIBCRYPTO=1` while building from source:```shAWS_CRT_BUILD_USE_SYSTEM_LIBCRYPTO=1 python3 -m pip install --no-binary :all: --verbose awscrt```( `--no-binary :all:` ensures you do not use the precompiled wheel from PyPI)You can ignore all this on Windows and Apple platforms, where aws-crt-pythonuses the OS's default libraries for TLS and cryptography math.## Mac-Only TLS BehaviorPlease note that on Mac, once a private key is used with a certificate, that certificate-key pair is imported into the Mac Keychain. All subsequent uses of that certificate will use the stored private key and ignore anything passed in programmatically. Beginning in v0.6.2, when a stored private key from the Keychain is used, the following will be logged at the &quot;info&quot; log level:```static: certificate has an existing certificate-key pair that was previously imported into the Keychain. Using key from Keychain instead of the one provided.```</longdescription>
