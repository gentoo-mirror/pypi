These provide a few examples offile conversions. Not going to get 100% coverage anytime soon but hopefullythis will help a little.```python&quot;&quot;&quot;Test module &quot;&quot;&quot;import sysimport osfrom pathlib import PathTHISDIR = str(Path(__file__).resolve().parent)sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(THISDIR))import layeredimage.io# ORAora = layeredimage.io.openLayerImage(THISDIR + &quot;/base24.ora&quot;)layeredimage.io.saveLayerImage(THISDIR + &quot;/base24(ora).ora&quot;, ora)layeredimage.io.saveLayerImage(THISDIR + &quot;/base24(ora).tiff&quot;, ora)ora.getFlattenLayers().save(THISDIR + &quot;/base24(ora).png&quot;)# PSDpsd = layeredimage.io.openLayerImage(THISDIR + &quot;/base24.psd&quot;)layeredimage.io.saveLayerImage(THISDIR + &quot;/base24(psd).ora&quot;, psd)layeredimage.io.saveLayerImage(THISDIR + &quot;/base24(psd).tiff&quot;, psd)psd.getFlattenLayers().save(THISDIR + &quot;/base24(psd).png&quot;)# PDNpdn = layeredimage.io.openLayerImage(THISDIR + &quot;/base24.pdn&quot;)layeredimage.io.saveLayerImage(THISDIR + &quot;/base24(pdn).ora&quot;, pdn)layeredimage.io.saveLayerImage(THISDIR + &quot;/base24(pdn).tiff&quot;, pdn)pdn.getFlattenLayers().save(THISDIR + &quot;/base24(pdn).png&quot;)# XCFxcf = layeredimage.io.openLayerImage(THISDIR + &quot;/base24.xcf&quot;)layeredimage.io.saveLayerImage(THISDIR + &quot;/base24(xcf).ora&quot;, xcf)layeredimage.io.saveLayerImage(THISDIR + &quot;/base24(xcf).tiff&quot;, xcf)xcf.getFlattenLayers().save(THISDIR + &quot;/base24(xcf).png&quot;)# TIFFtiff = layeredimage.io.openLayerImage(THISDIR + &quot;/base24.tiff&quot;)layeredimage.io.saveLayerImage(THISDIR + &quot;/base24(tiff).ora&quot;, tiff)layeredimage.io.saveLayerImage(THISDIR + &quot;/base24(tiff).tiff&quot;, tiff)tiff.getFlattenLayers().save(THISDIR + &quot;/base24(tiff).png&quot;)```## DocumentationA high-level overview of how the documentation is organized organized will help you knowwhere to look for certain things:&lt;!--- [Tutorials](/documentation/tutorials) take you by the hand through a series of steps to get  started using the software. Start here if you’re new.--&gt;- The [Technical Reference](/documentation/reference) documents APIs and other aspects of the  machinery. This documentation describes how to use the classes and functions at a lower level  and assume that you have a good high-level understanding of the software.&lt;!--- The [Help](/documentation/help) guide provides a starting point and outlines common issues that you  may have.--&gt;## Install With PIP```pythonpip install layeredimage```Head to https://pypi.org/project/layeredimage/ for more info## Language information### Built forThis program has been written for Python versions 3.8 - 3.11 and has been tested with both 3.8 and3.11## Install Python on Windows### Chocolatey```powershellchoco install python```### Windows - Python.orgTo install Python, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and download the latestversion.## Install Python on Linux### Apt```bashsudo apt install python3.x```### Dnf```bashsudo dnf install python3.x```## Install Python on MacOS### Homebrew```bashbrew install python@3.x```### MacOS - Python.orgTo install Python, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/ and download the latestversion.## How to run### Windows- Module`py -3.x -m [module]` or `[module]` (if module installs a script)- File`py -3.x [file]` or `./[file]`### Linux/ MacOS- Module`python3.x -m [module]` or `[module]` (if module installs a script)- File`python3.x [file]` or `./[file]`## BuildingThis project uses https://github.com/FHPythonUtils/FHMake to automate most of the building.
