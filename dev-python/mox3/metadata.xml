	<longdescription>=========================================Mox3 - Mock object framework for Python 3=========================================.. image:: https://governance.openstack.org/tc/badges/mox3.svg    :target: https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/tags/index.htmlMox3 is an unofficial port of the Google mox framework(http://code.google.com/p/pymox/) to Python 3. It was meant to be as compatiblewith mox as possible, but small enhancements have been made. The library wastested on Python version 3.2, 2.7 and 2.6.Use at your own risk ;)To install:  $ python setup.py installRunning Tests-------------The testing system is based on a combination of tox and testr. The canonicalapproach to running tests is to simply run the command `tox`. This willcreate virtual environments, populate them with depenedencies and run all ofthe tests that OpenStack CI systems run. Behind the scenes, tox is running`testr run --parallel`, but is set up such that you can supply any additionaltestr arguments that are needed to tox. For example, you can run:`tox -- --analyze-isolation` to cause tox to tell testr to add--analyze-isolation to its argument list.It is also possible to run the tests inside of a virtual environmentyou have created, or it is possible that you have all of the dependenciesinstalled locally already. In this case, you can interact with the testrcommand directly. Running `testr run` will run the entire test suite. `testrrun --parallel` will run it in parallel (this is the default incantation toxuses.) More information about testr can be found at:https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TestrBasic Usage-----------The basic usage of mox3 is the same as with mox, but the initial import shouldbe made from the mox3 module:  from mox3 import moxTo learn how to use mox3 you may check the documentation of the original moxframework:  http://code.google.com/p/pymox/wiki/MoxDocumentationOriginal Copyright------------------Mox is Copyright 2008 Google Inc, and licensed under the ApacheLicense, Version 2.0; see the file COPYING.txt for details.
