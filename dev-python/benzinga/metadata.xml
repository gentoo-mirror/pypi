	<longdescription>![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Benzinga/benzinga-python-client/master/logo/Benzinga_Logo-navy.png)# Benzinga Python ClientThis is the the official documentation for Benzinga's Python Package. This packageIs compatible with Python v3.x+. For extensive instructions, visit [Benzinga Docs](https://docs.benzinga.io/benzinga-python/)## Getting StartedThe installation process varies depending on your python version and system used. The basic installation instructions are as follows:```shellpip install benzinga```Alternatively, the package can be installed by using:```shellpip3 install benzinga```Once you have successfully installed the package, you can either import the Financial Data module, for quantitative financial data:```pythonfrom benzinga import financial_data```or you can import the Benzinga News Data module, if you're looking into financial news:```pythonfrom benzinga import news_data```## Your Key**Api Key** To initiate a class, an API key is used, forauthentication purposes. [Contact us](https://cloud.benzinga.com/lets-talk/) if you don't yet have a key, we will take care of you!*Sample API Key (type: str) : &quot;testkey892834789s9s8abshtuy&quot;*## Logging Information**Log=True** by default. Purpose of logging is to determine when the call was made *(2020-10-21 08:02.29)* and get the status of API call within the console *(Status Code: 200)**Log (type: bool)*## Sample Test Financial Data Module 1. Initiating the class:```pythonfrom benzinga import financial_dataapi_key = &quot;testkey892834789s9s8abshtuy&quot;fin = financial_data.Benzinga(api_key)# logging is by default True in above case, in order to turn off the logging set log to False fin = financial_data.Benzinga(api_key, log=False)```2. A sample test run to get ratings on a stock. (Returns a JSON object):```pythonstock_ratings = fin.ratings()```3. Since `fin.ratings()` returns a JSON dict, for a better view of the dict,you can call the `fin.output()` method on the result. Example:```pythonfin.output(stock_ratings)```## Sample Test News Data Module1. Initiating the class:```pythonfrom benzinga import news_dataapi_key = &quot;testkey892834789s9s8abshtuy&quot;paper = news_data.News(api_key)```2. A sample test run to get general news. (Returns a JSON Object)```pythonstories = paper.news()```3. Since `fin.news()` returns a JSON dict, for a better view of the dict,you can call the `fin.output()` method on the result. Example:```pythonpaper.output(stories)```It is important to note that for both the Financial Data Module and the News Data Module, there are many **optional** parameters for the methods. Below is a detailed listing of possible methods for the Financial Data Module and the news Data Module, their method call names, arguments, and what they return.
