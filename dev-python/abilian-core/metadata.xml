It's intended to be a rapid application development tool- It must promote best practices in software development, specially Test-Driven Development (as advocated by the `GOOS book &lt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321503627/&gt;`_)Features--------Here's a short list of features that you may find appealing in Abilian:Infrastructure^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-  Plugin framework-  Asynchronous tasks (using `Celery &lt;http://www.celeryproject.org/&gt;`_)-  Security model and serviceDomain model and services^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-  Persistent domain object model, based on SQLAlchemy-  AuditContent management and services^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-  Simple file-based content repository-  Indexing service-  Document preview and transformationSocial^^^^^^-  Users, groups and social graph (followers)-  Activity streamsUser Interface and API^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-  Forms (based on `WTForms &lt;http://wtforms.simplecodes.com/&gt;`_)-  CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Edit/Update, Remove) interface from domain   models-  Labels and descriptions for each field-  Various web utilities: view decorators, class-based views, Jinja2   filters, etc.-  A default UI based on `Bootstrap 3 &lt;http://getbootstrap.com/&gt;`_ and   several carefully selected jQuery plugins such as   `Select2 &lt;http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/&gt;`_-  REST and AJAX API helpers-  i18n: support for multi-language via Babel, with multiple translation   dictionariesManagement and admin^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-  Initial settings wizard-  Admin and user settings framework-  System monitoring (using `Sentry &lt;https://getsentry.com/welcome/&gt;`_)Current status--------------Abilian Core is currently alpha software, in terms of API stability.It is currently used in several applications that have been developpedby `Abilian &lt;http://www.abilian.com/&gt;`_ over the last two years:-  `Abilian SBE (Social Business Engine)   &lt;https://github.com/abilian/abilian-sbe/&gt;`_ - an enterprise 2.0   (social collaboration) platform-  Abilian EMS (Event Management System)-  Abilian CRM (Customer / Contact / Community Relationship Management   System)-  Abilian Le MOOC - a MOOC prototype-  Abilian CMS - a Web CMSIn other words, Abilian Core is the foundation for a small, but growing,family of business-critical applications that our customers intend us tosupport in the coming years.So while Abilian Core APIs, object model and even architecture, may (andmost probably will) change due to various refactorings that are expectedas we can't be expected to ship perfect software on the firt release, wealso intend to treat it as a valuable business asset and keepmaintaining and improving it in the foreseeable future.Roadmap &amp; getting involved--------------------------If you need help or for general discussions about the Abilian Platform, werecommend joing the `Abilian Users&lt;https://groups.google.com/g/abilian-users&gt;`_ forum on GoogleGroups.For features and bug requests (or is it the other way around?), werecommend that you use the `GitHub issuetracker &lt;https://github.com/abilian/abilian-core/issues&gt;`_.Read the `Contributing Guide &lt;CONTRIBUTING.md&gt;`_ for more information.Install=======If you are a Python web developer (which is the primary target for thisproject), you probably already know about:-  Python 3.8+-  Virtualenv-  Poetry (https://poetry.eustace.io/)So, after you have created and activated a virtualenv for the project,just run::    poetryTo use some features of the library, namely document and imagestransformation, you will need to install the additional native packages,using our operating system's package management tools (``dpkg``,``yum``, ``brew``...):-  A few image manipulation libraries (``libpng``, ``libjpeg``)-  The ``poppler-utils``, ``unoconv``, ``LibreOffice``, ``ImageMagick``   utilitiesLook at the ``fabfile.py`` for the exact list.Testing=======Abilian Core come with a full unit and integration testing suite. Youcan run it with ``make test`` (once your virtualenv has been activated andall required dependencies have been installed, see above).Alternatively, you can use ``tox`` to run the full test suite in anisolated environment.Licence=======Abilian Core is licensed under the LGPL.Credits=======Abilian Core has been created by the development team at Abilian(currently: Stefane and Bertrand), with financial support from ourwonderful customers, and R&amp;D fundings from the French Government, theParis Region and the European Union.We are also specially grateful to:-  `Armin Ronacher &lt;http://lucumr.pocoo.org/&gt;`_ for his work on Flask.-  `Michael Bayer &lt;http://techspot.zzzeek.org/&gt;`_ for his work on   SQLAlchemy.-  Everyone who has been involved with and produced open source software   for the Flask ecosystem (Kiran Jonnalagadda and the   `HasGeek &lt;https://hasgeek.com/&gt;`_ team, Max Countryman, Matt Wright,   Matt Good, Thomas Johansson, James Crasta, and many others).-  The creators of Django, Pylons, TurboGears, Pyramid and Zope, for   even more inspiration.-  The whole Python community.Links=====- `Discussion list (Google Groups) &lt;https://groups.google.com/g/abilian-users&gt;`_- `Documentation &lt;http://docs.abilian.com/&gt;`_- `GitHub repository &lt;https://github.com/abilian/abilian-core&gt;`_- `Corporate support &lt;http://www.abilian.com&gt;`_</longdescription>
