	<longdescription># SummaryAgency is a python library that provides a minimal framework for creatingagent-integrated systems.The library enables you to connect agents with software systems and human usersby allowing you to define actions, callbacks, and access policies making it easyto connect, monitor, and interact with your agents.Agency handles the communication details and allows discovering and invokingactions across parties, automatically handling things such as reportingexceptions, enforcing access restrictions, and more.## Features### Low-Level API Flexibility* Straightforward class/method based agent and action definition* Supports defining single process applications or networked agent systems### Observability and Control* Before/after action and lifecycle callbacks for observability or other needs* Access policies and permission callbacks for access control### Performance and Scalability* Multithreaded (though python's GIL is a bottleneck for single process apps)* AMQP support for multiprocess and networked systems (avoids GIL)* [_Python multiprocess support is planned for better scalability on  single-host systems_](https://github.com/operand/agency/issues/33)* [_Decentralized networking support planned_](https://github.com/operand/agency/issues/83)### Multimodal support* [_In development_](https://github.com/operand/agency/issues/26)### Demo application available at [`examples/demo`](./examples/demo/)* Includes Gradio UI (Flask/React UI also available)* Multiple agent examples for experimentation  * Two OpenAI agent examples  * HuggingFace transformers agent example  * Operating system access* Docker configuration for reference and development# API OverviewAgency is an implementation of the [Actormodel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) for building AI agentintegrated systems.In Agency, all entities are represented as instances of the `Agent` class. Thisincludes all human users, software, and AI-driven agents that may communicate aspart of your application.All agents may expose &quot;actions&quot; that other agents can discover and invoke at runtime. An example of a simple agent could be:```pythonclass CalculatorAgent(Agent):  def _action__add(a, b):    return a + b```This defines an agent with a single action: `&quot;add&quot;`. Other agents will be ableto call this method by sending a message to an instance of `CalculatorAgent` andspecifying the `&quot;add&quot;` action.```pythonother_agent._send({  'to': 'CalcAgent',  'thoughts': 'Optionally explain here',  'action': 'add',  'args': {    'a': 1,    'b': 2,  },})```Actions must also specify an access policy, allowing you to control access forsafety. For example:```python  @access_policy(ACCESS_PERMITTED) # This allows the action at any time  def _action__add(a, b):    ...```You can also define callbacks for various purposes:```pythonclass CalculatorAgent(Agent):  ...  def _before_action(self, original_message: dict):    # Called before any action is attempted  def _after_action(self, original_message: dict, return_value: str, error: str):    # Called after any action is attempted  def _after_add(self):    # Called after the agent is added to the space and may begin communicating  def _before_remove(self):    # Called before the agent is removed from the space  def _request_permission(self, proposed_message: dict) -&gt; bool:    # Called before an ACCESS_REQUESTED action is attempted for run-time review```A `Space` is how you connect your agents together. An agent cannot communicatewith others until it is added to a common `Space`.There are two included `Space` implementations to choose from:* `NativeSpace` - which connects agents within the same python process* `AMQPSpace` - which connects agents across processes and systems using an AMQP  server like RabbitMQ.Finally, here is an example of creating a `NativeSpace` and adding two agents to it.```pythonspace = NativeSpace()space.add(CalculatorAgent(&quot;CalcAgent&quot;))space.add(AIAgent(&quot;AIAgent&quot;))# The agents above can now communicate```These are just some of the main features. For more detailed informationplease see [the docs directory](./docs/).# Install```shpip install agency```or```shpoetry add agency```# The Demo ApplicationTo run the demo, please follow the directions at[examples/demo](./examples/demo/).The following is a screenshot of the Gradio UI that demonstrates the example`OpenAIFunctionAgent` following orders and interacting with the `Host`.&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ibb.co/h29m5S4/Screenshot-2023-07-26-at-4-53-05-PM.png&quot;      alt=&quot;Screenshot-2023-07-26-at-4-53-05-PM&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The screenshot above also demonstrates rejecting an action and directing anagent to use a different approach in real time. After I explained my rejectionof the `read_file` action (which happened behind the scenes on the terminal),`&quot;FunctionAI&quot;` appropriately used the `shell_command` action with `head -n 2Dockerfile`.# FAQ## How does Agency compare to other agent libraries?Though you could entirely create a simple agent using only the primitives inAgency (see [`examples/demo/agents/`](./examples/demo/agents/)), it is notintended to be an all-inclusive toolset like other libraries. For example, itdoes not include support for constructing prompts or working with vectordatabases, etc. Implementation of agent behavior is left up to you.The goal of Agency is to enable developers to experiment and create their ownagent solutions by providing a minimal set of functionality. So if you'relooking for a flexible yet minimal foundation for building your own agentsystem, Agency might be for you.## What are some known limitations or issues?* Agency is still in early development. Like many projects in the AI agent  space it is somewhat experimental at this time, with the goal of finding and  providing a minimal yet useful foundation for building agent systems.  Expect changes to the API over time as features are added or changed. The  library follows semver versioning starting at 1.x.x. Patch version updates may  contain breaking API changes. Minor versions should not.* This library makes use of threads for each individual agent. Multithreading  is limited by [python's  GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock), meaning that if you  run a local model or other heavy computation in the same process as other  agents, they may have to wait for their &quot;turn&quot;. Note that I/O does not block,  so networked backends or services will execute in parallel.  For blocking processes, it's recommended to use the `AMQPSpace` class and run  heavy computations in isolation to avoid blocking other agents.  [Multiprocessing support](https://github.com/operand/agency/issues/33) is also  planned as another option for avoiding the GIL.* This API does not assume or enforce predefined roles like &quot;user&quot;, &quot;system&quot;,  &quot;assistant&quot;, etc. This is an intentional decision and is not likely to change.  Agency is intended to allow potentially large numbers of agents, systems, and  people to come together. A small predefined set of roles gets in the way of  representing many things generally. This is a core design feature of Agency:  that all entities are represented similarly and may be interacted with through  common means.  The lack of roles may require extra work when integrating with role based  APIs. See the implementation of  [`OpenAIFunctionAgent`](./examples/demo/agents/openai_function_agent.py) for  an example.* There is currently not much by way of storage support. That is mostly left up  to you and I'd suggest looking at the many technologies that focus on that.  The `Agent` class implements a simple `_message_log` array which you can make  use of or overwrite to back it with longer term storage. More direct support  for storage APIs will likely be considered in the future.  # ContributingPlease do!## Development Installation```bashgit clone git@github.com:operand/agency.gitcd agencypoetry install```## Developing with the Demo ApplicationSee [the demo directory](./examples/demo/) for instructions on how to run thedemo.The demo application is written to showcase both native and AMQP spaces andseveral agent examples. It can also be used for experimentation and development.The application is configured to read the agency library source when running,allowing changes to be tested manually.## Test SuiteEnsure you have Docker installed. A small RabbitMQ container will beautomatically created.You can run the test suite with:```bashpoetry run pytest```## Planned Work[Please see the issues page.](https://github.com/operand/agency/issues)If you have any suggestions or otherwise, feel free to add an issue!</longdescription>
