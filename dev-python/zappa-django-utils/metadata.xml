Many of these utilities have become deprecated as new features have been added to AWS, or split into their own projects such a `django-s3-sqlite`: https://github.com/flipperpa/django-s3-sqliteWe're making one final release and will not be accepting further issues or pull requests.# DescriptionSmall utilities for making [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa) deployments slightly easier for Django applications.This project was inspired by Edgar Roman's [Zappa Django Guide](https://github.com/edgarroman/zappa-django-guide).## InstallationInstall via `pip`:    $ pip install zappa-django-utilsAdd to your installed apps:    INSTALLED_APPS += ['zappa_django_utils']## Usage### Using an S3-Backed Database Engine - DEPRECATED!Use `django-s3-sqlite` instead, as it has an updated SQLite driver compatible with current versions of Django:https://github.com/flipperpa/django-s3-sqlite### Creating a Postgres DatabaseOnce you have your RDS set up, your VPC/Subnet/Security Groups set up, and your `DATABASES` setting set up, you can create the database with:    $ zappa manage &lt;stage&gt; create_pg_dbThen you're ready to `python manage.py makemigrations` and `zappa update; zappa manage &lt;stage&gt; migrate`!### Creating a Default Admin User You'll probably need a default user to manage your application with, so you can now:    $ zappa manage &lt;stage&gt; create_admin_userOr you can pass some arguments:    $ zappa manage &lt;stage&gt; create_admin_user one two threeThis will internally make this call:```pythonUser.objects.create_superuser('one', 'two', 'three')```Now log in and immediately change the admin user's email and password.### Creating/Dropping a Postgres SchemaYou can create a [Postgres schema](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-schemas.html) with:    $ zappa manage create_pg_schemaand drop it with:    $ zappa manage drop_pg_schema## License(c) 2017, Rich Jones, MIT License</longdescription>
