These models can be queried by users seeking outputs from the network, for instance; generating text, audio, and images, or for extracting numerical representations of these input types. Under the hood, Bittensor’s *economic market*, is facilitated by a blockchain token mechanism, through which producers (***miners***) and the verification of the work done by those miners (***validators***) are rewarded. Miners host, train or otherwise procure machine learning systems into the network as a means of fulfilling the verification problems defined by the validators, like the ability to generate responses from prompts i.e. “What is the capital of Texas?. The token based mechanism under which the miners are incentivized ensures that they are constantly driven to make their knowledge output more useful, in terms of speed, intelligence and diversity. The value generated by the network is distributed directly to the individuals producing that value, without intermediaries. Anyone can participate in this endeavour, extract value from the network, and govern Bittensor. The network is open to all participants, and no individual or group has full control over what is learned, who can profit from it, or who can access it.To learn more about Bittensor, please read our [paper](https://bittensor.com/whitepaper).# InstallThere are three ways to install Bittensor1. Through the installer:```bash$ /bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opentensor/bittensor/master/scripts/install.sh)&quot;```2. With pip:```bash$ pip3 install bittensor```3. From source:```bash$ git clone https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor.git$ python3 -m pip install -e bittensor/```4. Using Conda (recommended for **Apple M1**):```bash$ conda env create -f ~/.bittensor/bittensor/scripts/environments/apple_m1_environment.yml$ conda activate bittensor```To test your installation, type:```bash$ btcli --help```or using python```pythonimport bittensor```# Wallets Wallets are the core ownership and identity technology around which all functions on Bittensor are carried out. Bittensor wallets consists of a coldkey and hotkey where the coldkey may contain many hotkeys, while each hotkey can only belong to a single coldkey. Coldkeys store funds securely, and operate functions such as transfers and staking, while hotkeys are used for all online operations such as signing queries, running miners and validating. Wallets can be created in two ways.1. Using the python-api```pythonimport bittensorwallet = bittensor.wallet()wallet.create_new_coldkey()wallet.create_new_hotkey()print (wallet)&quot;Wallet (default, default, ~/.bittensor/wallets/)&quot;```2. Or using btcli&gt; Use the subcommand `wallet` or it's alias `w`:```bash$ btcli wallet new_coldkey    Enter wallet name (default):          IMPORTANT: Store this mnemonic in a secure (preferably offline place), as anyone who has possession of this mnemonic can use it to regenerate the key and access your tokens.     The mnemonic to the new coldkey is:    **** *** **** **** ***** **** *** **** **** **** ***** *****    You can use the mnemonic to recreate the key in case it gets lost. The command to use to regenerate the key using this mnemonic is:    btcli w regen_coldkey --mnemonic post maid erode shy captain verify scan shoulder brisk mountain pelican elbow$ btcli wallet new_hotkey    Enter wallet name (default): d1    Enter hotkey name (default):     IMPORTANT: Store this mnemonic in a secure (preferably offline place), as anyone who has possession of this mnemonic can use it to regenerate the key and access your tokens.     The mnemonic to the new hotkey is:    **** *** **** **** ***** **** *** **** **** **** ***** *****    You can use the mnemonic to recreate the key in case it gets lost. The command to use to regenerate the key using this mnemonic is:    btcli w regen_hotkey --mnemonic total steak hour bird hedgehog trim timber can friend dry worry text```In both cases you should be able to view your keys by navigating to ~/.bittensor/wallets or viewed by running ```btcli wallet list``````bash$ tree ~/.bittensor/    .bittensor/                 # Bittensor, root directory.        wallets/                # The folder containing all bittensor wallets.            default/            # The name of your wallet, &quot;default&quot;                coldkey         # You encrypted coldkey.                coldkeypub.txt  # Your coldkey public address                hotkeys/        # The folder containing all of your hotkeys.                    default     # You unencrypted hotkey information.```Your default wallet ```Wallet (default, default, ~/.bittensor/wallets/)``` is always used unless you specify otherwise. Be sure to store your mnemonics safely. If you lose your password to your wallet, or the access to the machine where the wallet is stored, you can always regenerate the coldkey using the mnemonic you saved from above. ```bash$ btcli wallet regen_coldkey --mnemonic **** *** **** **** ***** **** *** **** **** **** ***** *****```## Using the cliThe Bittensor command line interface (`btcli`) is the primary command line tool for interacting with the Bittensor network. It can be used to deploy nodes, manage wallets, stake/unstake, nominate, transfer tokens, and more.### Basic UsageTo get the list of all the available commands and their descriptions, you can use:```bashbtcli --helpusage: btcli &lt;command&gt; &lt;command args&gt;bittensor cli v{bittensor.__version__}commands:  subnets (s, subnet) - Commands for managing and viewing subnetworks.  root (r, roots) - Commands for managing and viewing the root network.  wallet (w, wallets) - Commands for managing and viewing wallets.  stake (st, stakes) - Commands for staking and removing stake from hotkey accounts.  sudo (su, sudos) - Commands for subnet management.  legacy (l) - Miscellaneous commands.```### Example Commands#### Viewing Senate Proposals```bashbtcli root proposals```#### Viewing Senate Members```bashbtcli root list_delegates```#### Viewing Proposal Votes```bashbtcli root senate_vote --proposal=[PROPOSAL_HASH]```#### Registering for Senate```bashbtcli root register```#### Leaving Senate```bashbtcli root undelegate```#### Voting in Senate```bashbtcli root senate_vote --proposal=[PROPOSAL_HASH]```#### Miscellaneous Commands```bashbtcli legacy updatebtcli legacy faucet```#### Managing Subnets```bashbtcli subnets listbtcli subnets create```#### Managing Wallets```bashbtcli wallet listbtcli wallet transfer```### NotePlease replace the subcommands and arguments as necessary to suit your needs, and always refer to `btcli --help` or `btcli &lt;command&gt; --help` for the most up-to-date and accurate information.For example:```bashbtcli subnets --helpusage: btcli &lt;command&gt; &lt;command args&gt; subnets [-h] {list,metagraph,lock_cost,create,register,pow_register,hyperparameters} ...positional arguments:  {list,metagraph,lock_cost,create,register,pow_register,hyperparameters}                        Commands for managing and viewing subnetworks.    list                List all subnets on the network.    metagraph           View a subnet metagraph information.    lock_cost           Return the lock cost to register a subnet.    create              Create a new bittensor subnetwork on this chain.    register            Register a wallet to a network.    register            Register a wallet to a network using PoW.    hyperparameters     View subnet hyperparameters.options:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit```# The Bittensor PackageThe bittensor package contains data structures for interacting with the bittensor ecosystem, writing miners, validators and querying the network. Additionally, it provides many utilities for efficient serialization of Tensors over the wire, performing data analysis of the network, and other useful utilities.Wallet: Interface over locally stored bittensor hot + coldkey styled wallets. ```pythonimport bittensor# Bittensor's wallet maintenance class.wallet = bittensor.wallet() # Access the hotkeywallet.hotkey # Access the coldkeywallet.coldkey ( requires decryption )# Sign data with the keypair.wallet.coldkey.sign( data )```Subtensor: Interfaces with bittensor's blockchain and can perform operations like extracting state information or sending transactions.```pythonimport bittensor# Bittensor's chain interface.subtensor = bittensor.subtensor() # Get the chain blocksubtensor.get_current_block()# Transfer Tao to a destination address.subtensor.transfer( wallet = wallet, dest = &quot;xxxxxxx..xxxxx&quot;, amount = 10.0)# Register a wallet onto a subnetworksubtensor.register( wallet = wallet, netuid = 1 )```Metagraph: Encapsulates the chain state of a particular subnetwork at a specific block.```pythonimport bittensor# Bittensor's chain state object.metagraph = bittensor.metagraph( netuid = 1 ) # Resync the graph with the most recent chain statemetagraph.sync()# Get the list of stake valuesprint ( metagraph.S )# Get endpoint information for the entire subnetworkprint ( metagraph.axons )# Get the hotkey information for the miner in the 10th slotprint ( metagraph.hotkeys[ 10 ] )# Sync the metagraph at another blockmetagraph.sync( block = 100000 )# Save the metagraphmetagraph.save()# Load the samemetagraph.load()```Synapse: Responsible for defining the protocol definition between axon servers and dendrite clients```pythonclass Topk( bittensor.Synapse ):    topk: int = 2  # Number of &quot;top&quot; elements to select    input: bittensor.Tensor = pydantic.Field(..., allow_mutation=False)  # Ensure that input cannot be set on the server side.     v: bittensor.Tensor = None    i: bittensor.Tensor = Nonedef topk( synapse: Topk ) -&gt; Topk:    v, i = torch.topk( synapse.input.deserialize(), k = synapse.topk )     synapse.v = bittensor.Tensor.serialize( v )    synapse.i = bittensor.Tensor.serialize( i )    return synapse# Attach the forward function to the axon and start.axon = bittensor.axon().attach( topk ).start()```Axon: Serves Synapse protocols with custom blacklist, priority and verify functions.```pythonimport bittensorclass MySyanpse( bittensor.Synapse ):    input: int = 1    output: int = None# Define a custom request forwarding functiondef forward( synapse: MySyanpse ) -&gt; MySyanpse:    # Apply custom logic to synapse and return it    synapse.output = 2    return synapse# Define a custom request verification functiondef verify_my_synapse( synapse: MySyanpse ):    # Apply custom verification logic to synapse    # Optionally raise Exception# Define a custom request blacklist functiondef blacklist_my_synapse( synapse: MySyanpse ) -&gt; bool:    # Apply custom blacklist     # return False ( if non blacklisted ) or True ( if blacklisted )# Define a custom request priority functiondef prioritize_my_synape( synapse: MySyanpse ) -&gt; float:    # Apply custom priority    return 1.0 # Initialize Axon object with a custom configurationmy_axon = bittensor.axon(config=my_config, wallet=my_wallet, port=9090, ip=&quot;192.0.2.0&quot;, external_ip=&quot;203.0.113.0&quot;, external_port=7070)# Attach the endpoint with the specified verification and forwarding functions  my_axon.attach(    forward_fn = forward_my_synapse,     verify_fn=verify_my_synapse,    blacklist_fn = blacklist_my_synapse,    priority_fn = prioritize_my_synape).start()```     Dendrite: Inheriting from PyTorch's Module class, represents the abstracted implementation of a network client module designed to send requests to those endpoints to receive inputs.Example:```pythondendrite_obj = dendrite( wallet = bittensor.wallet() )# pings the axon endpointawait d( &lt;axon&gt; )# ping multiple axon endpointsawait d( [&lt;axons&gt;] ) # Send custom synapse request to axon.await d( bittensor.axon(), bittensor.Synapse() ) # Query all metagraph objects.await d( meta.axons, bittensor.Synapse() ) ```## Setting weights on root networkUse the `root` subcommand to access setting weights on the network across subnets.```bashbtcli root weights --wallet.name &lt;coldname&gt; --wallet.hotkey &lt;hotname&gt;Enter netuids (e.g. 0, 1, 2 ...):# Here enter your selected netuids to wet weights on1, 2&gt;Enter weights (e.g. 0.09, 0.09, 0.09 ...): # These do not need to sum to 1, we do normalization on the backend.# Values must be &gt; 00.5, 10Normalized weights:         tensor([ 0.5000, 10.0000]) -&gt; tensor([0.0476, 0.9524])Do you want to set the following root weights?:  weights: tensor([0.0476, 0.9524])  uids: tensor([1, 2])?
