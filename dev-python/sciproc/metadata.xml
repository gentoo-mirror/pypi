	<longdescription>===========sciproc===========Sciproc in experimental stage provides tools to select, edit, convertscientific (observed, model-generated) data. It needs Numpy. It's veryexperimental, as some functions aren't tested or only tested in 'idealisedcases', so please be careful.  Please let me know if you would like tocontribute. Currently selection from 1D data by coordinates or certain timestepand applying a function repeatedly on a multidimensional matrix is implemented.However selecting, interpolating and editing procedures for multidimensionaldata is planned in the near future.  You might want to use it if you have haveany observational data and you want to select a period, make a selection with acertain timestep or make an interpolation. The aim is to make an addition tothe cdo climate data operators with python power (see also pynacolada). Itshould be working with normal numpy data. However, if you want to processnetcdf-files, we recommend to use the pynacolada interface which acutally usessciproc. Typical usageoften looks like this::    #!/usr/bin/env python    from numpy import *    from sciproc import *    # select data from a 1-D array:    data = array([1.0,2.0,4.0,2.5])    incoords = array([0.0,1.0,2.0,3.0])    print(datatimeco(data,coords = incoords,outcoords = array([1.0,2.0]))    a = array([[[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[4,1,3]],[[1,2,3],[4,1,2],[3,0,1]]])    print('copy')    print( multifunc(a,[False,False,True],lambda x: copyfunction(x)))    print('take only elements 2 and 3 from third dimension')    print(multifunc(a,[False,False,True],lambda x: secondandthirdelement(x)))    print('take only elements 2 and 3 from second dimension')    print(multifunc(a,[False,True,False],lambda x: secondandthirdelement(x)))    print('reduce dimension')A Section=========A Sub-Section-------------</longdescription>
