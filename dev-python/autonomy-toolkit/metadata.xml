	<longdescription># Autonomy ToolkitAutonomy Toolkit, dubbed `autonomy-toolkit`, is meant to be a simplified mechansim for quickly setting up and developing a ROS 2 based control stack. The `autonomy-toolkit` platform is under activate development by the [Simulation Based Engineering Laboratory](https://sbel.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://wisc.edu).## BackgroundThe `autonomy-toolkit` platform provides the following resources for expediting development of autonomous algorithms:1. A development workflow for writing and testing ROS 2 code2. A mechansim for easily generating custom container-based images (think Docker) for use with the ROS 2 stack3. A wrapper for container compose mechanisms (i.e. Docker Compose, singularity-compose) to improve user experienceFurthermore, the [Autonomy Research Testbed](https://github.com/uwsbel/autonomy-research-testbed), which utilizes this toolbox, provides the following functionality:1. A parts list and instructions on how to build the physical platform2. A high-fidelity simulation environment built using [Chrono](https://projectchrono.org) to test autonomous algorithmsFor more information about the design considerations and purpose for this project, see the [background](https://projects.sbel.org/autonomy-toolkit/background.html) section.## SupportContact the [Simulation Based Engineering Laboratory](mailto:negrut@wisc.edu) for any questions or concerns regarding the contents of this repository.## See AlsoVisit our website at [sbel.wisc.edu](https://sbel.wisc.edu)!&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/uwsbel/autonomy-toolkit/blob/master/docs/_static/SBEL-dark.png?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Simulation Based Engineering Lab Logo&quot; class=&quot;readme-img&quot; height=&quot;100px&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/uwsbel/autonomy-toolkit/blob/master/docs/_static/UWCrest.png?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;University of Wisconsin - Madison Crest&quot; class=&quot;readme-img&quot; height=&quot;100px&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</longdescription>
