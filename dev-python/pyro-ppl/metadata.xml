	<longdescription>[Getting Started](http://pyro.ai/examples) |[Documentation](http://docs.pyro.ai/) |[Community](http://forum.pyro.ai/) |[Contributing](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)Pyro is a flexible, scalable deep probabilistic programming library built on PyTorch.  Notably, it was designed with these principles in mind:- **Universal**: Pyro is a universal PPL - it can represent any computable probability distribution.- **Scalable**: Pyro scales to large data sets with little overhead compared to hand-written code.- **Minimal**: Pyro is agile and maintainable. It is implemented with a small core of powerful, composable abstractions.- **Flexible**: Pyro aims for automation when you want it, control when you need it. This is accomplished through high-level abstractions to express generative and inference models, while allowing experts easy-access to customize inference.Pyro was originally developed at Uber AI and is now actively maintained by community contributors, including a dedicated team at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/).In 2019, Pyro [became](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/2019/02/pyro-probabilistic-programming-language-becomes-newest-lf-deep-learning-project/) a project of the Linux Foundation, a neutral space for collaboration on open source software, open standards, open data, and open hardware.For more information about the high level motivation for Pyro, check out our [launch blog post](http://eng.uber.com/pyro).For additional blog posts, check out work on [experimental design](https://eng.uber.com/oed-pyro-release/) and[time-to-event modeling](https://eng.uber.com/modeling-censored-time-to-event-data-using-pyro/) in Pyro.## Installing### Installing a stable Pyro release**Install using pip:**```shpip install pyro-ppl```**Install from source:**```shgit clone git@github.com:pyro-ppl/pyro.gitcd pyrogit checkout master  # master is pinned to the latest releasepip install .```**Install with extra packages:**To install the dependencies required to run the probabilistic models included in the `examples`/`tutorials` directories, please use the following command:```shpip install pyro-ppl[extras] ```Make sure that the models come from the same release version of the [Pyro source code](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/releases) as you have installed.### Installing Pyro dev branchFor recent features you can install Pyro from source.**Install Pyro using pip:**```shpip install git+https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro.git```or, with the `extras` dependency to run the probabilistic models included in the `examples`/`tutorials` directories:```shpip install git+https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro.git#egg=project[extras]```**Install Pyro from source:**```shgit clone https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyrocd pyropip install .  # pip install .[extras] for running models in examples/tutorials```## Running Pyro from a Docker ContainerRefer to the instructions [here](docker/README.md).## CitationIf you use Pyro, please consider citing:```@article{bingham2019pyro,  author    = {Eli Bingham and               Jonathan P.
