	<longdescription># zappix - a package for Zabbix sender and get.zappix aims to be a drop-in replacement for zabbix_get as well as zabbix_sender.Its components are available not only as a module but from the command line as well.zappix requires Python3 and is guaranteed to work with 3.6.## Instalation zappix is not dependant on any third party modules.The easiest way to install it with pip:```shpip install zappix```# UsageAs mentioned earlier - zappix can be used both as a module inside of an application, as well as from the Command Line Interface.## As a moduleAt the moment zappix has two classes: Sender and Get. Both of which can be imported in the following manner:```python&gt;&gt;&gt; from zappix.sender import Sender&gt;&gt;&gt; from zappix.get import Get```Then you can send or get some data. Asuming both Zabbix Agent and Server run on localhost and default ports:```python&gt;&gt;&gt; getter = Get(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;)&gt;&gt;&gt; getter.get_value(&quot;agent.ping&quot;)1&gt;&gt;&gt; sender = Sender(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;)&gt;&gt;&gt; sender.send_value('testhost', 'test', 1){&quot;processed&quot;: 1, &quot;failed&quot;: 0, &quot;total&quot;: 1, &quot;seconds spent&quot;: 0.005}```## CLITo use this utility from the command line, you need to invoke python with the -m flag, followed by the module name and required parameters:```shpython -m zappix.sender -z 127.0.0.1 -s testhost -k testkey -o 1```## TestingIf you wish to contribute it's good to know how to conduct tests.You can go with mocked tests only or add integration tests as well.To enable integration tests, set the envvar `ZAPPIX_TEST_INTEGRATION=yes`After if you wish to proceed with services in docker containers run the following:```shelldocker run -d -e &quot;ZBX_CACHEUPDATEFREQUENCY=1&quot; -p 10051:10051 -p 80:80 zabbix/zabbix-appliancedocker run -d -e &quot;ZBX_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0/0&quot; -p 10050:10050 zabbix/zabbox-agent```Note that the zabbix-appliance might take a while to start. Once both containers are up and running, just run `tox`.If you have your custom Zabbix services, it is possible to configure tests via envvars to connect to those:| envvar          | usage                                                                                                              || --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ || ZAPPIX_AGENT    | IP address or DNS name of running Zabbix agent                                                                     || ZAPPIX_SERVER   | IP address or DNS name of running Zabbix Server                                                                    || ZAPPIX_API      | URL of Zabbix fronted.
