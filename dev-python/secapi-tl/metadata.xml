	<longdescription># secapiThis module provides an API that can be used to query metadata from secfilings. These metadata can then be used to create a link to the actual filingswhich can then be parsed.## Technical informationThe module was developed with python 2.7.18 and only uses build-in python packages as wellas the packages typing, requests, ratelimiter and [OpenDateRange](https://github.com/tlie03/OpenDateRange).## Installation``$ pip install secapi-tl``## What functionalities does the API provide?### Query filing metadataThe most important function ist the `get_filings` functionwhich takes one required and four optional search parameters.The required parameter is the ticker symbol of the company whose filings are requested. If none of the optional arguments is set all filings of the given company will be returned.The following arguments are optional.* date_from : only filings that have been filed on this date or a current datewill be returned* date_to : only filings that have been filed on this date or a former datewill be returned* form_types : filters all filings based on a list of form types, so only filingswith a form type from the list will be returned* filings_information: returns only the metadata points for each filing thatare included in the given list. This can be used to reduce the amount of dataand to get rid of irrelevant data.A list of all possible data points can be found belowThe return value will be a list of Filing Objects. Each Filing holds multiple metadata points. Two of these metadata points are the ticker symbol and the cik which are always part of the metadata.By default, all other metadata points are contained in the Filing, butthey can also be specifically selected via the filing_information parameterof the get_filings function.Below is a list of all possible metadata points:* accessionNumber* filingDate* reportDate* acceptanceDateTime* act* form* fileNumber* filmNumber* items* size* isXBRL* isInlineXBRL* primaryDocument* primaryDocDescriptionThese metadata can then be used to create the links to the actual filings.The process of finding a way to build the links from the metadata can be quite difficult, and requires a lot of experimentation.### How to make requests to the sec serverThe sec has restricted the access to their servers .Thereby it is not allowedto do more than 10 requests per second. To ensure that the amount of requests stayswithin the boundaries set by the sec this package provides the `sec_request`function which can be used to do requests to the sec servers. Thefunction has a ratelimiter which ensures that the function can only be executed10 times per second. Due to the sleep and retry property of the functionthe user does not have to worry about the number of function calls he makes.Furthermore, all code segments in this package that make requeststo the sec servers use the same function as well. Thereby the request limitcan not be exceeded when alle requests are made with the `sec_request`function. Because of that it is necessary that a user of this API usesthis function for all requests to the sec servers otherwise problems can occur.### Utility functions* `get_cik` can be used to get the cik that belongs to a ticker symbol* `is_registered` can be used to proof if a company is registered at the secBoth functions take the ticker symbol of the company as an argument</longdescription>
