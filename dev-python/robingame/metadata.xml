	<longdescription># RobinGameObject-oriented tools for PyGame projects :) Todo: - Make EventQueue instance-based instead of class-based (or at least allow multiple instances to be created with separate contents, so you can have multiple event queues if you want)- Input / controller overhaul  - Do we need the is_pressed / is_released stuff? Can we use keyup / down events instead?   - Perhaps the relevant classes can implement the event-based method under the hood, so the interface doesn't change.</longdescription>
