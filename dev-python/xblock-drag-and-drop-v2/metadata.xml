	<longdescription>Drag and Drop XBlock v2=======================This XBlock implements a friendly drag-and-drop style problem, wherethe learner has to drag items to zones on a target image.The editor is fully guided. Features include:* custom target image* free target zone positioning and sizing* custom zone labels* ability to show or hide zone borders* custom text and background colors for items* auto-alignment for items: left, right, center* image items* decoy items that don't have a zone* feedback popups for both correct and incorrect attempts* introductory and final feedbackThe XBlock supports progressive grading and keeps progress acrossrefreshes. All checking and record keeping is done on the server side.The following screenshot shows the Drag and Drop XBlock renderedinside the edX LMS before the user starts solving the problem:![Student view start](doc/img/student-view-start.png)This screenshot shows the XBlock after the learner successfullycompleted the Drag and Drop problem:![Student view finish](doc/img/student-view-finish.png)Installation------------Install the requirements into the Python virtual environment of your`edx-platform` installation by running the following command from theroot folder:```bash$ pip install -r requirements.txt```Theming-------The Drag and Drop XBlock ships with an alternate theme called &quot;Apros&quot;that you can enable by adding the following entry to `XBLOCK_SETTINGS`in `lms.env.json`:```json        &quot;drag-and-drop-v2&quot;: {            &quot;theme&quot;: {                &quot;package&quot;: &quot;drag_and_drop_v2&quot;,                &quot;locations&quot;: [&quot;public/themes/apros.css&quot;]            }        }```You can use the same approach to apply a custom theme:`&quot;package&quot;` can refer to any Python package in your virtualenv, whichmeans you can develop and maintain your own theme in a separatepackage. There is no need to fork or modify this repository in any wayto customize the look and feel of your Drag and Drop problems.`&quot;locations&quot;` is a list of relative paths pointing to CSS filesbelonging to your theme. While the XBlock loads, files will be addedto it in the order that they appear in this list. (This means that ifthere are rules with identical selectors spread out over differentfiles, rules in files that appear later in the list will takeprecedence over those that appear earlier.)Finally, note that the default (unthemed) appearance of the Drag andDrop XBlock has been optimized for accessibility, so its use isencouraged -- especially for courses targeting large and/orpotentially diverse audiences.Enabling in Studio------------------Drag and Drop v2 XBlock is already included in Open edX.You will find it in `&quot;Add New Component&quot;` box in Studio:click the green `Problem` button, choose the the `Advanced` taband choose `Drag and Drop`.Usage-----The Drag and Drop XBlock features an interactive editor. Add the Dragand Drop component to a lesson, then click the `EDIT` button.![Edit view](doc/img/edit-view.png)In the first step, you can set some basic properties of the component, such asthe title, the problem mode, the maximum number of attempts, the maximum score,the problem text to render above the background image, the introductory feedback(shown initially), and the final feedback (shown after the learner successfullycompletes the drag and drop problem, or when the learner runs out of attempts).There are two problem modes available:* **Standard**: In this mode, the learner gets immediate feedback on each  attempt to place an item, and the number of attempts is not limited.* **Assessment**: In this mode, the learner places all items on the board and  then clicks a &quot;Submit&quot; button to get feedback.  * The number of attempts can be limited.  * The learner can click a &quot;Show Answer&quot; button to temporarily place items on their correct drop zones.        You can select one of the pre-defined conditions for displaying this button. They work in the same way as in the    Problem XBlock, so you can read about each them in the [Problem Component documentation][capa-show-answer].      By default, the value from the course &quot;Advanced Settings&quot; configuration is used. If you have modified this for    a specific XBlock but want to switch back to using the default value, select the &quot;Default&quot; option.[capa-show-answer]: https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/open-edx-building-and-running-a-course/en/latest/course_components/create_problem.html#show-answer![Drop zone edit](doc/img/edit-view-zones.png)In the next step, you set the URL and description for the backgroundimage and define the properties of the drop zones. For each zone youcan specify the text that should be rendered inside it (the &quot;zonelabel&quot;), how wide and tall it should be, and where it should be placedon the background image. In this step you can also specify whether youwould like zone labels to be shown to learners or not, as well aswhether or not to display borders outlining the zones. It is possibleto define an arbitrary number of drop zones as long as their labelsare unique.You can specify the alignment for items once they are dropped inthe zone. Centered alignment is the default, and places items from top to bottomalong the center of the zone. Left alignment causes dropped items to be placed from leftto right across the zone. Right alignment causes the items to be placed fromright to left across the zone. Items dropped in a zone will not overlap,but if the zone is not made large enough for all its items, they will overflow the bottomof the zone, and potentially overlap the zones below.![Drag item edit](doc/img/edit-view-items.png)In the final step, you define the background and text color for drag items, aswell as the drag items themselves. A drag item can contain either text or animage. You can define custom success and error feedback for each item. Instandard mode, the feedback text is displayed in a popup after the learner dropsthe item on a zone - the success feedback is shown if the item is dropped on acorrect zone, while the error feedback is shown when dropping the item on anincorrect drop zone.  In assessment mode, the success feedback textsare not used, while error feedback texts are shown when learner submits a solution.You can select any number of zones for an item to belong to usingthe checkboxes; all zones defined in the previous step are available.You can leave all of the checkboxes unchecked in order to create a&quot;decoy&quot; item that doesn't belong to any zone.You can define an arbitrary number of drag items, each of which maybe attached to any number of zones.&quot;Maximum items per Zone&quot; setting controls how many items can be dropped into asingle zone, allowing some degree of control over items overlapping zones below.Scoring-------Student assessment scores for the Drag and Drop XBlock are calculated accordingto the following formula:    score = (C + D) / TWhere *C* is the number of correctly placed regular items, *D* is the number ofdecoy items that were correctly left unplaced, and *T* is the total number ofitems available.Example: consider a Drag and Drop instance configured with a total of fouritems, of which three are regular items and one is a decoy.  If a learnerplaces two of the normal items correctly and one incorrectly (`C = 2`), andwrongly places the decoy item onto a drop zone (`D = 0`), that learner's scorewill be `50%`, as given by:    score = (2 + 0) / 4If the learner were to then move the decoy item back to the bank (`D = 1`) andmove the wrongly placed regular item to the correct dropzone (`C = 3`), theirscore would be `100%`:    score = (3 + 1) / 4Optionally, there is an alternative grading that can be enabled, by setting thewaffle flag `drag_and_drop_v2.grading_ignore_decoys`, which will dropthe decoy items entirely from the score calculation. The formula will change to:    score = C / RWhere *C* is the number of correctly placed regular items, *R* is the number ofrequired regular items.Demo Course-----------Export of a demo course that showcases various Drag and Drop v2features is available at[github.com/open-craft/demo-courses/archive/drag-and-drop-v2.tar.gz](https://github.com/open-craft/demo-courses/archive/drag-and-drop-v2.tar.gz).Analytics Events----------------The following analytics events are provided by this block.## `edx.drag_and_drop_v2.loaded`Fired when the Drag and Drop XBlock is finished loading.Example (&quot;common&quot;

So far only two translations are available:* Default English translation* Fake &quot;Esperanto&quot; translation used to test i18n/l10n.Updates to translated strings are supposed to be propagated to `text.po` files. EdX [i18n_tools][edx-i18n-tools] is used here along GNU Gettext and a Makefile for automation.[edx-i18n-tools]: https://github.com/openedx/i18n-toolsNote: currently `translations` directory is a symbolic link to `conf/locale` directory. Also, 'text.po' file for locale code `en` is a symbolic link to `conf/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/django.po` file. Both links works as a transition step to fully moving translation files to [openedx-translations](https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations) repositoryTranslatable strings--------------------```bash$ make extract_translations```Note that this command generates `text.po` which is supposed to containall translatable strings.To check if `text.po` is correct, one can run:```bash$ make compile_translations```If everything is correct, it will create `translations/en/LC_MESSAGES/text.mo` and `locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/text.js` files.Building fake &quot;Esperanto&quot; translation-------------------------------------As previously said, this fake translation mainly exists for testing reasons. For edX platform it is built using Dummytranslator from edX i18n-tools.```bash$ make dummy_translations```Transifex translations-------------------------------------If you want to download translations from run this command while inside project root directory```bash$ make pull_translations```Translations can be pushed to Transifex with:```bash$ make push_translations```Native API----------Further information on the API for native mobile applications can be found [here][native-api-doc].[native-api-doc]: ./Native_API.mdReleasing-------------------------------------To release a new version, update .travis.yml and setup.py to point to your new intended version number and create a new release with that version tag via Github.Drag and Drop XBlock changelog==============================Unreleased---------------------------Version 3.3.0 (2023-10-24)---------------------------* Removed xblock-utils package  * Replace `xblockutils.*` imports with `xblock.utils.*`.

This is to avoid the possibility of having message compilation failure because of duplicate strings (strings shared between both files)Version 3.2.0 (2023-04-20)---------------------------* Use the `replace_urls` service instead of a runtime property.  BREAKING CHANGE: This version is no longer compatible with Maple. Version 3.1.3 (2023-04-15)--------------------------* Prepare repository for upcoming changes related to [openedx-translations](https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations).  * `conf/locale` directory is now the source of truth for translations.  * `translations` directory is now a symbolic link for backwards compatibility.  * `locale` symbolic link is deleted to avoid too many symbolic links.  * `en` translations are now extracted into `django.po` instead of `text.po`.  * `en` `text.po` is now a symbolic link to `django.po` for backwards compatibility.Version 3.1.0 (2023-01-31)--------------------------* Upgrade to be compatible with `bleach==6.0.0` and `bleach&lt;6.0.0`* Make the dependency on the `css` extras explicit.Version 3.0.0 (2022-11-18)---------------------------* Sanitize HTML tags to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

The problem div now contains the drag container, buttons and feedback, css classes from submit button; submit answer and action buttons were also changed.* Improve feedback styles, now only icons shows color related with feedback and text color remains the same also each feedback line doesn't show borders.* Replaced `Travis` with `GitHub CI`.Version 2.3.7 (2022-02-20)---------------------------* Reduce drag delay on mobile devices.Version 2.3.6 (2021-08-11)---------------------------* Add Portuguese translations.Version 2.3.5 (2021-03-09)---------------------------* Updates supported language translations.Version 2.3.4 (2021-03-09)---------------------------* Enable adding weighted problems and overriding the scores for learners.
