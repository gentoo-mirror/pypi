Finsy includes support for [gNMI](https://github.com/openconfig/reference/blob/master/rpc/gnmi/gnmi-specification.md).Check out the [examples](https://github.com/byllyfish/finsy/tree/main/examples) directoryfor some demonstration programs.## InstallationFinsy requires Python 3.10 or later. To install the latest version, type `pip install finsy`.## P4Runtime ScriptsWith Finsy, you can write a Python script that reads/writes P4Runtime entities for a single switch.Here is a complete example that retrieves the P4Info from a switch:```pythonimport finsy as fyasync def main():    async with fy.Switch(&quot;sw1&quot;, &quot;127.0.0.1:50001&quot;) as sw1:        # Print out a description of the switch's P4Info, if one is configured.        print(sw1.p4info)fy.run(main())```Here is another example that prints out all non-default table entries.```pythonimport finsy as fyasync def main():    async with fy.Switch(&quot;sw1&quot;, &quot;127.0.0.1:50001&quot;) as sw1:        # Do a wildcard read for table entries.        async for entry in sw1.read(fy.P4TableEntry()):            print(entry)fy.run(main())```## P4Runtime ControllerYou can also write a P4Runtime controller that manages multiple switches independently. Your controllercan react to events from the Switch by changing the contents of P4 tables.Each switch is managed by an async `ready_handler` function. Your `ready_handler` function can read or update various P4Runtime entities in the switch. It can also create tasks to listen for packets or digests.When you write P4Runtime updates to the switch, you use a unary operator (+, -, \~) to specify the operation:INSERT (+), DELETE (-) or MODIFY (\~).```pythonimport finsy as fyasync def ready_handler(sw: fy.Switch):    await sw.delete_all()    await sw.write(        [            # Insert (+) multicast group with ports 1, 2, 3 and CONTROLLER.            +fy.P4MulticastGroupEntry(1, replicas=[1, 2, 3, 255]),            # Modify (~) default table entry to flood all unmatched packets.            ~fy.P4TableEntry(                &quot;ipv4&quot;,                action=fy.P4TableAction(&quot;flood&quot;),                is_default_action=True,            ),        ]    )    async for packet in sw.read_packets():        print(f&quot;{sw.name}: {packet}&quot;)```Use the `SwitchOptions` class to specify each switch's settings, including the p4info/p4blob and `ready_handler`. Use the `Controller` class to drive multiple switch connections. Each switch will call backinto your `ready_handler` function after the P4Runtime connection is established.```pythonfrom pathlib import Pathoptions = fy.SwitchOptions(    p4info=Path(&quot;hello.p4info.txt&quot;),    p4blob=Path(&quot;hello.json&quot;),    ready_handler=ready_handler,)controller = fy.Controller([    fy.Switch(&quot;sw1&quot;, &quot;127.0.0.1:50001&quot;, options),    fy.Switch(&quot;sw2&quot;, &quot;127.0.0.1:50002&quot;, options),    fy.Switch(&quot;sw3&quot;, &quot;127.0.0.1:50003&quot;, options),])fy.run(controller.run())```Your `ready_handler` can spawn concurrent tasks with the `Switch.create_task` method. Taskscreated this way will have their lifetimes managed by the switch object.If the switch disconnects or its role changes to backup, the task running your `ready_handler` (and any tasks it spawned) will be cancelled and the `ready_handler` will begin again.For more examples, see the [examples](https://github.com/byllyfish/finsy/tree/main/examples) directory.## Switch Read/Write APIThe `Switch` class provides the API for interacting with P4Runtime switches. You will control a Switch object with a &quot;ready handler&quot; function. The `ready handler` is anasync function that is called when the switch is ready to accept commands.Your `ready handler` will typically write some control entities to the switch, thenlisten for incoming events and react to them with more writes. You may occasionally read entitiesfrom the switch.When your `ready handler` is invoked, there is already a P4Runtime channel established, with clientarbitration completed, and pipeline configured as specified in `SwitchOptions`.Here is an example skeleton program. The `ready handler` is named `ready()`.```pythonasync def ready(switch: Switch):    # Check if switch is the primary. If not, we may want to proceed    # in a read-only mode. In this example, ignore switch if it's a backup.    if not switch.is_primary:        return    # If we're reconnecting to a switch, it will already have runtime state.    # In this example, we just delete all entities and start over.    await switch.delete_all()    # Provision the pipeline with one or more `write` transactions. Each    # `write` is a single WriteRequest which may contain multiple updates.    await switch.write(        # [Next section will cover what goes here.]    )    # Listen for events and respond to them. This &quot;infinite&quot; loop will    # continue until the Switch disconnects, changes primary/backup status,    # or the controller is stopped.    async for packet in switch.read_packets():        await handle_packet(switch, packet)```The Switch class provides a `switch.create_task` method to start a managed task.Tasks allow you to perform concurrent operations on the same switch. We could havewritten the last stanza above that reads packets in an infinite loop as a separatetask. It's okay for the ready handler function to return early; any tasks itcreated will still run.### WritesUse the `write()` method to write one or more P4Runtime updates and packets.A P4Runtime update supports one of three operations: INSERT, MODIFY or DELETE.Some entities support all three operations. Other entities only support MODIFY.| Entity | Operations Permitted | ------ | -------------------| `P4TableEntry` |  INSERT, MODIFY, DELETE| `P4ActionProfileMember` |  INSERT, MODIFY, DELETE| `P4ActionProfileGroup` |  INSERT, MODIFY, DELETE| `P4MulticastGroupEntry` |  INSERT, MODIFY, DELETE| `P4CloneSessionEntry` |  INSERT, MODIFY, DELETE| `P4DigestEntry` |  INSERT, MODIFY, DELETE| `P4RegisterEntry` | MODIFY| `P4CounterEntry` | MODIFY| `P4DirectCounterEntry` | MODIFY| `P4MeterEntry` | MODIFY| `P4DirectMeterEntry` | MODIFY| `P4ValueSetEntry` | MODIFYThe `write()` method takes an optional keyword argument `atomicity` to specify the atomicity option.#### Insert/Modify/Delete UpdatesTo specify the operation, use a unary `+` (insert), `~` (modify), or `-` (delete). If youdo not specify the operation, `write` will raise a `ValueError` exception.Here is an example showing how to insert and delete two different entities in the same WriteRequest.```pythonawait switch.write([    +P4TableEntry(          # unary + means insert        &quot;ipv4&quot;,         match=P4TableMatch(dest=&quot;192.168.1.0/24&quot;),        action=P4TableAction(&quot;forward&quot;, port=1),    ),    -P4TableEntry(          # unary - means delete        &quot;ipv4&quot;,         match=P4TableMatch(dest=&quot;192.168.2.0/24&quot;),        action=P4TableAction(&quot;forward&quot;, port=2),    ),])```You should not insert, modify or delete the same entry in the same WriteRequest.If you are performing the **same** operation on all entities, you can use the Switch `insert`, `delete`, or `modify` methods.```pythonawait switch.insert([    P4MulticastGroupEntry(1, replicas=[1, 2, 3]),    P4MulticastGroupEntry(2, replicas=[4, 5, 6]),])```#### Modify-Only UpdatesFor entities that only support the modify operation, you do not need to specify the operation. (You canoptionally use `~`.)```pythonawait switch.write([    P4RegisterEntry(&quot;reg1&quot;, index=0, data=0),    P4RegisterEntry(&quot;reg1&quot;, index=1, data=1),    P4RegisterEntry(&quot;reg1&quot;, index=2, data=2),])```You can also use the `modify` method:```pythonawait switch.modify([    P4RegisterEntry(&quot;reg1&quot;, index=0, data=0),    P4RegisterEntry(&quot;reg1&quot;, index=1, data=1),    P4RegisterEntry(&quot;reg1&quot;, index=2, data=2),])```If you pass a modify-only entity to the `insert` or `delete` methods, the P4Runtime server willreturn an error.#### Sending PacketsUse the `write` method to send a packet.```await switch.write([P4PacketOut(b&quot;payload&quot;, port=3)])```You can include other entities in the same call. Any non-update objects (e.g. P4PacketOut, P4DigestListAck) will be sent **before** the WriteRequest.#### Listening for PacketsTo receive packets, use the async iterator `Switch.read_packets()`.In this example, `pkt` is a `P4PacketIn` object.`read_packets` can filter for a specific `eth_type`.```python# Read packets filtering only for ARP (eth_type == 0x0806).async for pkt in switch.read_packets(eth_types={0x0806}):    # You can access the packet payload `pkt.payload` or any metadata value,    # e.g. `pkt['ingress_port']`    print(pkt.payload)    print(pkt['ingress_port'])```#### Listening for DigestsTo receive digests, use the async iterator `Switch.read_digests`. You must specify the name of the digest from your P4 program.```pythonasync for digest in switch.read_digests(&quot;digest_t&quot;):    # You can access the digest metadata e.g. `digest['ingress_port']`    # Your code may need to update table entries based on the digest data.    # To ack the digest, write `digest.ack()`.    await switch.write([entry, ...])    await switch.write([digest.ack()])```To acknowledge the digest entry, you can write `digest.ack()`.#### Other EventsA P4 switch may report other events using the `EventEmitter` API. Seethe `SwitchEvent` class for the event types. Each switch has a `switch.ee`attribute that lets your code register for event callbacks.## Development and TestingPerform these steps to set up your local environment for Finsy development, or try the [codespace](https://codespaces.new/byllyfish/finsy). Finsy requires Python 3.10 or later. If [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is not installed, follow [these directions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to install it.### Clone and Prepare a Virtual EnvironmentThe `poetry install` command installs all development dependencies into thevirtual environment (venv).```sh$ git clone https://github.com/byllyfish/finsy.git$ cd finsy$ python3 -m venv .venv$ poetry install```### Run Unit TestsWhen you run pytest from the top level of the repository, you will run the unit tests.```sh$ poetry run pytest```### Run Integration TestsWhen you run pytest from within the `examples` directory, you will run the integrationtests instead of the unit tests. The integration tests run the example programs against a[Mininet](https://github.com/mininet/mininet) network. Docker or podman are required.```bash$ cd examples$ poetry run pytest```---</longdescription>
