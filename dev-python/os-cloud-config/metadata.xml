Change things from this point on===============================os-cloud-config===============================Configuration for OpenStack clouds.When first installing an OpenStack cloud there are a number of commonup-front configuration tasks that need to be performed. To alleviatethe need for different sets of tooling to reinvent solutions to theseproblems, this package provides a set of tools.These tools are intended to be well-tested, and available asimportable Python modules as well as command-line tools.* Free software: Apache license* Documentation: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/os-cloud-configFeatures--------* generate-keystone-pki:  * Generate a certificate authority and a signing key for use with Keystone    Public Key Infrastructure token signing.* init-keystone:  * Initialize Keystone on a host with a provided admin token, admin e-mail    and admin password. Also allows optionally changing the region and the    public endpoint that Keystone registers with itself.* register-nodes:  * Register nodes with a baremetal service, such as Nova-baremetal or Ironic.* setup-endpoints:  * Register services, such as Glance and Cinder with a configured Keystone.* setup-flavors:  * Creates flavors in Nova, either describing the distinct set of nodes the    cloud has registered, or a custom set of flavors that has been specified.* setup-neutron:  * Configure Neutron at the cloud (not the host) level, setting up either a    physical control plane network suitable for deployment clouds, or an    external network with an internal floating network suitable for workload    clouds.</longdescription>
