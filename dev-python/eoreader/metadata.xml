Indeed, SAR sensors are able to detect through clouds and during nighttime (which is particularly useful during flood and storm events), while optical sensors benefit from of multi spectral bands to better analyze and classify the crisis information.As every minute counts in the production of geoinformation in an emergency mode, it seemed crucial to harmonize the ground on which are built our production tools, in order to make them assensor-agnostic as possible.This is why SERTIT decided to decouple the sensor handling from the extraction algorithms: the latter should be able to ingest semantic bands (i.e. `RED` or `VV`) without worrying about how to load the specific sensor band or in what unit it is.  The assumption was made that all the spectral bands from optical sensors could be mapped between each other, in addition to the natural mapping between SAR bands.Thus, thanks to **EOReader**, these tools are made independent to the constellation:  ✅ the algorithm (and its developer) can focus on its core tasks (such as extraction) without taking into account the sensor characteristics (how to load a band, which band correspond to which band number, …)  ✅ new sensor addition is effortless (if existing in **EOReader**) and requires no algorithm modification  ✅ maintenance is simplified and the code quality is significantly improved  ✅ testing is also simplified as the sensor-related parts are tested in EOReader library  However, keep in mind that the support of all the constellations used in CEMS is done in the best effort mode, especially for commercial data.Indeed, we may not have faced every product type, sensor mode or order configuration, so some details may be missing.If this happens to you, do not hesitate to make a PR or write an issue about that !## Talks- [GeoPython 2022](https://submit.geopython.net/geopython-2022/talk/FQPN3Q/) [ [PDF](https://seafile.unistra.fr/f/be2b461af970465b903e/) ] [ [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKxOiRULOJA&amp;t=14303s) ]- Mentionned in **[Live+]SIG 2022 by ESRI France** (in French):  `Enrichir ArcgisPro grâce à des processus personnalisés d'observation de la Terre`  [ [PDF](https://seafile.unistra.fr/f/9502a14f142041468837/) ]- Mentioned in GeoPython 2023 - `FLORIA, a custom python pipeline for urban flood extraction from SAR multi-sensors, supported by U-Net convolutional network.`- Mentioned in EGU 2023 - [`Cutting-edge developments in rapid mapping`](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-14143) - [FOSS4G 2023](https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2023/talk/XJH7JE/) [ [PDF](https://seafile.unistra.fr/f/f727dc62cdfe471f9b33/) ] [ [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZfPQrTypmQ) ]## Press Release- [ESA Success Story](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/news/new-open-source-python-library-improves-rapid-mapping-services)- Used to extract water for assessing agriculture impacts after the Kakhovka Dam Collapse (cross-post from [NASA Harvest](https://nasaharvest.org/index.php/news/navigating-kakhovka-dam-collapse-nasa-harvest-consortium-assesses-agriculture-impacts) and [Planet](https://www.planet.com/pulse/navigating-the-kakhovka-dam-collapse-nasa-harvest-consortium-assesses-agriculture-impacts-with-satellite-imagery/))## Articles- [Maxant, J.
