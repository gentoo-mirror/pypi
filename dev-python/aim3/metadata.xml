Either enter a name in the box for a new group, or select a button for an existing group.Edit button lets you edit the groups. (For now, just used for removing images from a group.# CLI VersionThere is also a command-line version available. Run the aim-cli.py script for a non-gui way of quickly managing appimages.If run on its own, enters an interactive mode where it'll ask for commands as you go. If you run it with command arguments, it'll run the command then exit.aim-cli.py help shows all the commandsCurrently supported operations: finding apps in directory, running apps, installing apps from Downloads, automatically handling execution permissions on appimages.# RequiresJust tkinter. Everything else should be stock python3 libraries.Only tested in python3.</longdescription>
