	<longdescription># Linode Python BindingsThe bindings consist of three pieces:  - api.py: Core library that manages authentication and api calls  - shell.py: A command line interface to api.py that allows you to invoke      a specific api command quickly  - oop.py: An object oriented interface to api.py inspired by djangoFor definitive documentation on how the api works please visit:https://www.linode.com/api## API KeysWhen creating an api object you may specify the key manually, or use theApi.user_getapikey which will return your apikey as well as set the internalkey that will be used for subsequent api calls.Both the shell.py and oop.py have mechanisms to pull the api key from theenvironment variable LINODE_API_KEY as well.## BatchingBatching should be used with care, once enabled all api calls are cached untilApi.batchFlush() is called, however you must remember the order in which callswere made as that's the order of the list returned to you## LicenseThis code is provided under an MIT-style license. Please refer to the LICENSEfile in the root of the project for specifics.</longdescription>
