	<longdescription># WireGuard-toolsPure Python reimplementation of wireguard-tools with an aim to provide easilyreusable library functions to handle reading and writing of[WireGuardÂ®](https://www.wireguard.com/) configuration files as well asinteracting with WireGuard devices, both in-kernel through the Netlink API anduserspace implementations through the cross-platform UAPI API.## Installation/Usage```sh    pipx install wireguard-tools    wg-py --help```Implemented `wg` command line functionality,- [x] show - Show configuration and device information- [x] showconf - Dump current device configuration- [ ] set - Change current configuration, add/remove/change peers- [x] setconf - Apply configuration to device- [ ] addconf - Append configuration to device- [x] syncconf - Synchronizes configuration with device- [x] genkey, genpsk, pubkey - Key generationAlso includes some `wg-quick` functions,- [ ] up, down - Create and configure WireGuard device and interface- [ ] save - Dump device and interface configuration- [x] strip - Filter wg-quick settings from configurationNeeds root (sudo) access to query and configure the WireGuard devices throughnetlink. But root doesn't know about the currently active virtualenv, you mayhave to pass the full path to the script in the virtualenv, or use`python3 -m wireguard_tools````sh    sudo `which wg-py` showconf &lt;interface&gt;    sudo /path/to/venv/python3 -m wireguard_tools showconf &lt;interface&gt;```## Library usage### Parsing WireGuard keysThe WireguardKey class will parse base64-encoded keys, the default base64encoded string, but also an urlsafe base64 encoded variant. It also exposesboth private key generating and public key deriving functions. Be sure to passany base64 or hex encoded keys as 'str' and not 'bytes', otherwise it willassume the key was already decoded to its raw form.```pythonfrom wireguard_tools import WireguardKeyprivate_key = WireguardKey.generate()public_key = private_key.public_key()# print base64 encoded keyprint(public_key)# print urlsafe encoded keyprint(public_key.urlsafe)# print hexadecimal encoded keyprint(public_key.hex())```### Working with WireGuard configuration filesThe WireGuard configuration file is similar to, but not quite, the INI formatbecause it has duplicate keys for both section names (i.e. [Peer]) as well asconfiguration keys within a section. According to the format description,AllowedIPs, Address, and DNS configuration keys 'may be specified multipletimes'.```pythonfrom wireguard_tools import WireguardConfigwith open(&quot;wg0.conf&quot;) as fh:    config = WireguardConfig.from_wgconfig(fh)```Also supported are the &quot;Friendly Tags&quot; comments as introduced byprometheus-wireguard-exporter, where a `[Peer]` section can containcomments which add a user friendly description and/or additional attributes.```[Peer]# friendly_name = Peer description for end users# friendly_json = {&quot;flat&quot;=&quot;json&quot;, &quot;dictionary&quot;=1, &quot;attribute&quot;=2}...```These will show up as additional `friendly_name` and `friendly_json` attributeson the WireguardPeer object.We can also serialize and deserialize from a simple dict-based format whichuses only basic JSON datatypes and, as such, can be used to convert to variousformats (i.e. json, yaml, toml, pickle) either to disk or to pass over anetwork.```pythonfrom wireguard_tools import WireguardConfigfrom pprint import pprintdict_config = dict(    private_key=&quot;...&quot;,    peers=[        dict(            public_key=&quot;...&quot;,            preshared_key=None,            endpoint_host=&quot;remote_host&quot;,            endpoint_port=5120,            persistent_keepalive=30,            allowed_ips=[&quot;0.0.0.0/0&quot;],            friendly_name=&quot;Awesome Peer&quot;,        ),    ],)config = WireguardConfig.from_dict(dict_config)dict_config = config.asdict()pprint(dict_config)```Finally, there is a `to_qrcode` function that returns a segno.QRCode objectwhich contains the configuration. This can be printed and scanned with thewireguard-android application. Careful with these because the QRcode exposesan easily captured copy of the private key as part of the configuration file.It is convenient, but definitely not secure.```pythonfrom wireguard_tools import WireguardConfigfrom pprint import pprintdict_config = dict(    private_key=&quot;...&quot;,    peers=[        dict(            public_key=&quot;...&quot;,            preshared_key=None,            endpoint_host=&quot;remote_host&quot;,            endpoint_port=5120,            persistent_keepalive=30,            allowed_ips=[&quot;0.0.0.0/0&quot;],        ),    ],)config = WireguardConfig.from_dict(dict_config)qr = config.to_qrcode()qr.save(&quot;wgconfig.png&quot;)qr.terminal(compact=True)```### Working with WireGuard devices```pythonfrom wireguard_tools import WireguardDeviceifnames = [device.interface for device in WireguardDevice.list()]device = WireguardDevice.get(&quot;wg0&quot;)wgconfig = device.get_config()device.set_config(wgconfig)```## BugsThe setconf/syncconf implementation is not quite correct. They currently usethe same underlying set of operations but netlink-api's `set_config`implementation actually does something closer to syncconf, while the uapi-apiimplementation matches setconf.This implementation has only been tested on Linux where we've only activelyused a subset of the available functionality, i.e. the common scenario isconfiguring an interface only once with just a single peer.## Licenseswireguard-tools is MIT licensed    Copyright (c) 2022-2023 Carnegie Mellon University    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of    this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal in    the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to    use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies    of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do    so, subject to the following conditions:    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all    copies or substantial portions of the Software.
