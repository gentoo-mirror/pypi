	<longdescription>DroneCAN GUI Tool =======================DroneCAN GUI Tool is a cross-platform (Windows/Linux/OSX) application for UAVCAN v0.9 and/or DroneCAN V1 management and diagnostics.[Read the docs at **https://dronecan.org**](https://dronecan.org).[Ask questions at **https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-contact-us.html**](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-contact-us.html).Read installation instructions:- [**GNU/LINUX**](#installing-on-gnulinux)- [**WINDOWS**](#installing-on-windows)- [**MACOS**](#installing-on-macos)![DroneCAN GUI Tool screenshot](screenshot.png &quot;DroneCAN GUI Tool screenshot&quot;)## Installing on GNU/LinuxThe general approach is simple:1. Install PyQt5 for Python 3 using your OS' package manager (e.g. APT).2. Install the application itself from Git via PIP:`pip3 install git+https://github.com/DroneCAN/gui_tool@master`(it is not necessary to clone this repository manually).Alternatively, if you're a developer and you want to install your local copy, use `pip3 install .`.It also may be necessary to install additional dependencies, depending on your distribution (see details below).Once the application is installed, you should see new desktop entries available in your desktop menu;also a new executable `dronecan_gui_tool` will be available in your `PATH`.If your desktop environment doesn't update the menu automatically, you may want to do it manually, e.g.by invoking `sudo update-desktop-database` (command depends on the distribution).It is also recommended to install Matplotlib - it is not used by the application itself,but it may come in handy when using the embedded IPython console.### Debian-based distributions```bashsudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheelsudo apt-get install -y python3-numpy python3-pyqt5 python3-pyqt5.qtsvg git-coresudo pip3 install git+https://github.com/DroneCAN/gui_tool@master```#### TroubleshootingIf installation fails with an error like below, try to install IPython directly with `sudo pip3 install ipython`:&gt; error: Setup script exited with error in ipython setup command:&gt; Invalid environment marker: sys_platform == &quot;darwin&quot; and platform_python_implementation == &quot;CPython&quot;If you're still unable to install the package, please open a ticket.### RPM-based distributions*Maintainers wanted*#### Fedora 29+```bashsudo dnf install python3-PyQt5sudo pip3 install git+https://github.com/DroneCAN/gui_tool@master```## Installing on WindowsIn order to install this application,**download and install the latest `.msi` package from here: &lt;https://firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/CAN_GUI/&gt;**.### Building the MSI packagePlease see the file winbuild.bat in this directory, or use the MSI file build by github actions on any commit## Installing on macOSOSX support is a bit lacking in the way that installation doesn't create an entry in the applications menu,but this issue should be fixed someday in the future.Other than that, everything appears to function more or less correctly.If you have a choice, it is recommended to use Linux or Windows instead,as these ports are supported much better at the moment.### Homebrew option* Install the Homebrew package manager for OSX.* Run the following commands:```bashbrew install python3brew postinstall python3pip3 install PyQt5pip3 install git+https://github.com/DroneCAN/gui_tool@masterdronecan_gui_tool```### MacPorts optionInstall XCode from App Store, install MacPorts from &lt;https://www.macports.org/install.php&gt;,then run the commands below.If you're prompted to install Command Line Developer Tools, agree.```bashsudo port selfupdatesudo port install curl-ca-bundle py35-pip py35-pyqt5 py35-numpysudo python3.5 -m pip install git+https://github.com/DroneCAN/gui_tool@master```We would like to provide prebuilt application packages instead of the mess above.Contributions adding this capability would be welcome.## Development### Releasing new versionFirst, deploy the new version to PyPI. In order to do that, perform the following steps:1. Update the version tuple in `version.py`, e.g. `1, 0`, and commit this change.2. Create a new tag with the same version number as in the version file, e.g. `git tag -a 1.0 -m v1.0`.3. Push to master: `git push &amp;&amp; git push --tags`Then, build a Windows MSI package using the instructions above, and upload the resulting MSI tothe distribution server.### Code stylePlease follow the existing code styles .## HistoryMuch of the development of this tool is based upon original work byPavel Kirienko and others from the UAVCAN Development Team.
