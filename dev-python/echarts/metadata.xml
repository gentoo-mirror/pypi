	<longdescription>A sample Python project=======================A sample project that exists as an aid to the `Python Packaging User Guide&lt;https://packaging.python.org&gt;`_'s `Tutorial on Packaging and DistributingProjects &lt;https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html&gt;`_.This projects does not aim to cover best practices for Python projectdevelopment as a whole. For example, it does not provide guidance or toolrecommendations for version control, documentation, or testing.----This is the README file for the project.The file should use UTF-8 encoding and be written using `reStructuredText&lt;http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html&gt;`_. Itwill be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI and will be displayed asthe project homepage on common code-hosting services, and should be written forthat purpose.Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basicusage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is nota good idea, although a simple &quot;What's New&quot; section for the most recent versionmay be appropriate.</longdescription>
