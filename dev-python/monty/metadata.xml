	<longdescription>Monty: Python Made Even Easier==============================.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/materialsvirtuallab/monty.png?branch=master.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/materialsvirtuallab/monty/badge.svg?branch=master.. image:: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/monty/badges/downloads.svgMonty is the missing complement to Python. Monty implements supplementaryuseful functions for Python that are not part of the standard library.Examples include useful utilities like transparent support for zipped files,useful design patterns such as singleton and cached_class, and many more.Python is a great programming language and comes with &quot;batteriesincluded&quot;. However, even Python has missing functionality and/or quirks thatmake it more difficult to do many simple tasks. In the process ofcreating several large scientific frameworks based on Python,my co-developers and I have found that it is often useful to createreusable utility  functions to supplement the Python standard library. Ourforays in various developer sites and forums also found that many developersare looking for solutions to the same problems.Monty is created to serve as a complement to the Python standard library. Itprovides suite of tools to solve many common problems, and hopefully,be a resource to collect the best solutions.Monty supports Python 3.x.Please visit the `official docs &lt;https://materialsvirtuallab.github.io/monty&gt;`_ for more information.</longdescription>
