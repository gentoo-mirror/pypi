	<longdescription>Onium - Inject hebrew support into slack desktop app====================================================Onium is a small utility to inject Hebrew support (automatic RTL) intoSlack’s desktop app. Onium does this by modifying Slack’s app.asar(Slack application code) and changes the Slack app itself.What is Onium?--------------Onium fixes one of Slack’s most glaring issues for users in countrieswhose script is written Right-to-left. It does so by injecting code intoSlack that modifies the displayed text to correctly show Right-to-leftwords.The Slack app is built using Electron, which essentially wraps aChromium browser and a Node.js server together. Onium modifies the HTMLdisplayed by the Chromium browser to properly support Hebrew (and RTL)languages.Onium does this by modifying Slack’s internal code (creating a “Fixed”solution), until Slack adds a new update.Requirements------------You need Python 2.7 or 3.5 or later to run Onium. Onium should work onWindows, Mac and Linux.Quick start-----------Onium can be installed using pip:::   $ python -m pip install oniumAs long as python’s scripts folder is in your path, simply run::   $ onium Usage-----Onium supports various command line parameters::   usage: onium [-h] [-l LOCATION] [--no-kill] [--no-start] [-b BACKUP]                      [-f] [-d]   Inject hebrew support plugin into Slack's tab inside an electron app. This   program injects the Chrome's hebrew_slack plugin into any electron (desktop)   version of the slack app   optional arguments:     -h, --help            show this help message and exit     -l LOCATION, --location LOCATION                           Location of application to run, or auto, local                           (Windows only), store (Windows only) [default: auto]     --no-kill             Do not attempt to kill original application before                           starting     --no-start            Do not attempt to start application (assume already                           running)     -b BACKUP, --backup BACKUP                           Name to use save original slack app backup.
