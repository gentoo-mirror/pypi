[Resources](#resources)## DescriptionThe evg-module-manager is a tool to help improve the local workflows of working with modules inyour evergreen projects. It will help you keep any modules defined in your local project in sync.It supports the following functionality:* List what modules are defined in the local project.* List what modules are currently active in your local repo.* Clone a module repository.* Enable/disable modules in your local repo.* Create an evergreen patch build that includes changes from the local patch build and all enabled  modules.* Submit a changes to the commit-queue that includes changes from the local patch build and all  enabled modules.## Getting Help### What's the right channel to ask my question?If you have a question about evg-module-manager, please mention @dag-on-call in theslack channel [#evergreen-users](https://mongodb.slack.com/messages/#evergreen-users/)or email us atdev-prod-dag@mongodb.com.### How can I request a change/report a bug in evg-module-manager?Create a [DAG ticket](https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/DAG).### What should I include in my ticket or #evergreen-users question?Since #evergreen-users questions are interrupts,please include as much information as possible.This can help avoid long information-gathering threads.Please include the following in any created tickets:* **Motivation for Request**  * Provide us the motivation for this change.* **Context**  * Provide some background context for this issue.* **Description**  * Provide some description on how this issue happened.## DocumentationRead the documentation [here](https://evergreen-ci.github.io/evg-module-manager/).## Dependencies* Python 3.7 or later* git* evergreen command line tool* [Evergreen config file](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen/wiki/Using-the-Command-Line-Tool#downloading-the-command-line-tool)* [github CLI](https://cli.github.com/)See [Usage Prerequisites](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evg-module-manager/blob/main/docs/usage.md#prerequities)for more details.## InstallationWe strongly recommend using a tool like [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) to installthis tool. This will isolate the dependencies and ensure they don't conflict with other tools.```bash$ pipx install evg-module-manager```### Debugging installation issuesA common issue that arises during installation is pipx failing to install emm and printing out the following error:```bash$ pipx install evg-module-managerFatal error from pip prevented installation. Full pip output in file:    /home/ubuntu/.local/pipx/logs/cmd_2022-03-31_13.24.42_pip_errors.log Some possibly relevant errors from pip install:    ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement evg-module-manager (from versions: none)    ERROR: No matching distribution found for evg-module-manager Error installing evg-module-manager.```This error indicates that pipx could not find a version of emm that was built to support the version of Python installed on your machine.Make sure to check that your version of Python matches the requirements called out in the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section. Youcan check the version of Python that is on your computer by running```bash$ python --version```If you are running into the issue above but are sure that the correct version of Python is installed on your computer,you can explicitly specify a path to the correct Python version during installation.```bash$ which python3.9/usr/bin/python3.9$ pipx install evg-module-manager --python /usr/bin/python3.9```## UsageSee the [documentation](https://evergreen-ci.github.io/evg-module-manager/) for details about using this tool.```bashUsage: evg-module-manager [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Pre-commit will runconfigured checks at git commit time. To enable pre-commit on your local repository run:```bashpoetry run pre-commit install```### VersioningThis project uses [semver](https://semver.org/) for versioning.Please include a description what is added for each new version in `CHANGELOG.md`.### Code ReviewPlease open a Github Pull Request for code review.### DeploymentDeployment to pypi is automatically triggered on merges to main.## Resources* [Evergreen REST documentation](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen/wiki/REST-V2-Usage)</longdescription>
