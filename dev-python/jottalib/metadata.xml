The service itself exposes a nice and simple HTTP RESTapi, and this library wraps that interface in a python module, in thehope that it may be useful.This is a community project, not an official Jottacloud product. It isdeveloped `according to the company founder'sinstructions &lt;http://forum.jotta.no/jotta/topics/api_http&gt;`__, withwrite support reverse engineered `explicitly blessed by companystaff &lt;http://forum.jotta.no/jotta/topics/jotta_api_for_remote_storage_fetch#reply_14928642&gt;`__.All code is GPLv3 licensed, and the `documentation isonline &lt;https://pythonhosted.org/jottalib/&gt;`__.In addition to the general library, you'll also find different backuptools, some different plugins as well as a FUSE implementation in here.Caveats-------This code is **not production ready** and it might not eat your cat, but itmight mangle your cat photos!Write support is reverse engineered and not based on official docs. Bugspatrol these waters! (When you find them, add to the `bugtracker! &lt;https://github.com/havardgulldahl/jottalib/issues/&gt;`__ )Installation------------Note that we've separated the code into different variants:-  If you are a normal user, wanting to backup your stuff: get   ``jottalib[scanner] and jottalib[monitor]``-  If you are a developer and want to add connectivity to JottaCloud.com   to your project, get ``jottalib``Via pip~~~~~~~The easiest way: ``pip install jottalib[scanner]`` or ``pip install jottalib[monitor]``.Optional requirements~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~These are all the extra variants you would install if you need it:-  ``pip install jottalib[FUSE]`` for a Fuse client (`read more   about   it &lt;https://github.com/havardgulldahl/jottalib/wiki/Normal-use-cases#i-want-a-virtual-jottacloud-file-system&gt;`__)-  ``pip install jottalib[scanner]`` for a tool to scan through a whole file   folder on your system (`read more about   it &lt;https://github.com/havardgulldahl/jottalib/wiki/Normal-use-cases#i-want-a-drop-folder-so-everything-i-put-there-is-stored-automatically&gt;`__)-  ``pip install jottalib[monitor]`` for a tool to continuously monitor a   folder on your system (`read more about   it &lt;https://github.com/havardgulldahl/jottalib/wiki/Normal-use-cases#i-want-a-drop-folder-so-everything-i-put-there-is-stored-automatically&gt;`__)-  ``pip install jottalib[Qt]`` for developers wanting to use the Qt   models (`help is on the   way &lt;https://github.com/havardgulldahl/jottalib/wiki/Developers#qt-models&gt;`__)Documentation-------------To help both end users and developers to get started, a lot of use casesare `covered in thewiki &lt;https://github.com/havardgulldahl/jottalib/wiki&gt;`__.Authors-------The library was initiated by havard@gulldahl.no, but **a project likethis needs a lot of community love**.
