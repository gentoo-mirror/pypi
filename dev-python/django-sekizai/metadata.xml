	<longdescription>==============Django Sekizai==============|pypi| |build| |coverage|Sekizai means &quot;blocks&quot; in Japanese, and that's what this app provides. A freshlook at blocks. With django-sekizai you can define placeholders where yourblocks get rendered and at different places in your templates append to thoseblocks. This is especially useful for css and javascript. Your sub-templates cannow define css and Javascript files to be included, and the css will be nicelyput at the top and the Javascript to the bottom, just like you should. Alsosekizai will ignore any duplicate content in a single block.There are some issue/restrictions with this implementation due to how thedjango template language works, but if used properly it can be very useful andit is the media handling framework for the django CMS (since version 2.2)... note::                 This project is endorsed by the `django CMS Association &lt;https://www.django-cms.org/en/about-us/&gt;`_.
