	<longdescription>mscerts=======This package provides easy access to the Root Certificate Authorities present inthe Microsoft Trusted Root Program. It is a fork of Kenneth Reitz's`certifi &lt;https://pypi.org/project/certifi/&gt;`_ project, which provides accessto Mozilla's collection of Root Certificates.**Warning:** Microsoft's CA Program allows granular CA deprecation, which is notproperly supported by certificate bundle files. This means that using thisbundle may result in improper trust being applied, e.g. trusting certificatesthat are not actually trusted in their current use.It is therefore **highly recommended** to use `certifi` instead for almost allneeds, except in cases where the Microsoft store is specifically required, suchas in the `signify &lt;https://pypi.org/project/signify/&gt;`_ project.Installation------------``mscerts`` is available on PyPI. Simply install it with ``pip``::    $ pip install mscertsUsage-----To reference the installed certificate authority (CA) bundle, you can use thebuilt-in function::    &gt;&gt;&gt; import mscerts    &gt;&gt;&gt; mscerts.where()    '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mscerts/cacert.pem'Or from the command line::    $ python -m mscerts    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mscerts/cacert.pemAddition/Removal of Certificates--------------------------------This package is simply a mirror of the Microsoft store, and does not supportany addition/removal or other modification of the CA trust store content.The sole provider of certificates in this store is Microsoft. Seehttps://aka.ms/RootCert for more information.</longdescription>
