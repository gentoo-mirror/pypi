Translator uses this number `e` of epoch to determine     the rate of time between updates     by the amount of sentences     given for translation at once.    If this number is too small, you will face Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors.    If it is too big, you will get poor efficency.    Keep it between 1 and the sum of sentences to translate.    For maximum efficency keep it as low as you can while beeing able     to fit `epoch_split` number of sentences     into `device`'s memory.  - `--batch_size (-b)` as big as possible but as small as necessary.    Translator uses this value every time it needs to batch sentences to work on them.    Mostly impacts the amount of sentences to batch togheter from `epoch_split` sentences to translate in one go.    Keep it as high as possible (&lt;`epoch_split`) but as low as your `device` memory allows to (&lt;=1).    For GPU using multiples of `2` is best for memory optimization     (i.e. `2`, `4`, `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`, `128`, `256`, `512`, etc.).  - `--nproc (-n)` to equal your amount of virtual threads on CPU for maximum performance.    This value is used by translator everytime multiples sentences need to be processed by the CPU.    Keeping it at its highest possible value,     garanties maximum performances. With a good processor and a single fast and large GPU, you can translate an average just shy of a 100 sentences per second.On my Threadripper 2920X's 24 threads, using my RTX 3060's 12 Gb of space, I can peak at ~97 translations/second averaging a bit lower at 83.I have not tested yet on my two RTX Titans but if you want to distribute the computation, you'll have to do it manually for now.It's in my todo list but I won't be offended if you send me a pull request to implement it.Using `Translator` with `python`.```pythonfrom translator import Translatortranslator = Translator(&quot;eng_Latn&quot;, &quot;fra_Latn&quot;)english_sentence = &quot;This is just a simple phrase.&quot; or [    &quot;Those are multiples sentences.&quot;,    &quot;If you have lots of them, load them directly from file.&quot;,    &quot;To efficiently batch translate them.&quot;  ]french_sentence = translator.translate(english_sentence)print(f&quot;{english_sentence=}&quot;)print(f&quot;{french_sentence=}&quot;)```## LanguagesDepending on models used, you might get fewer choices but with `NLLB` you get more than 200 most popular ones.```zsh# translate -L‚ùØ translate --language_listLanguage list:    ...```From `python`:```python&gt;&gt;&gt; import translator&gt;&gt;&gt; len(translator.LANGS)202&gt;&gt;&gt; translator.LANGS['ace_Arab', '...', 'zul_Latn']&gt;&gt;&gt; from translator.language import get_nllb_lang, get_sys_lang_format&gt;&gt;&gt; nllb_lang = get_nllb_lang(&quot;en&quot;)&gt;&gt;&gt; nllb_lang'eng_Latn'&gt;&gt;&gt; get_sys_lang_format()'fra_Latn'```Checkout [`LANGS`](translator/language.py) to see the full list of supported languages.## Using a custom modelCheckout [HuggingFace Zoo of Translation Models](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=translation&amp;sort=downloads).Or [train your own model](https://huggingface.co/autotrain) for the `translate` or `translate_xx_to_xx` pipeline.## LicenseThis project is distributed under [Mozilla Public License 2.0](LICENSE).Using this tool to translate a sentence, the licence of the original sentence still applies unless specified otherwise.Meaning, if you translate a sentence under [Creative Commons CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/), the translation is also under Creative Commons CC0.Idem for any licence.## ContributionI love stars ‚≠ê but also chocolate üç´ so don't hesitate to [sponsor this project](https://github.com/sponsors/wasertech)!Otherwise if you like the project and want to see it grow, get more convenience features like a dedicated service/client to speed up multiple translations,etc. Don't hesitate to share your ideas by opening a ticket or even proposing a pull request.</longdescription>
