This will also build the TS package.```bash# First install the python package. This will also build the JS packages.pip install -e &quot;.[test, examples]&quot;# Run the python tests. This should not give you a few successful example testspy.test```When developing your extensions, you need to manually enable your extensions with thenotebook / lab frontend. For lab, this is done by the command:```cd jsjupyter labextension develop --overwrite .yarn run build```For classic notebook, you can run:```jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --symlink --overwrite --py jupyter_jsmoljupyter nbextension enable --sys-prefix --py jupyter_jsmol```Note that the `--symlink` flag doesn't work on Windows, so you will here have to runthe `install` command every time that you rebuild your extension. For certain installationsyou might also need another flag instead of `--sys-prefix`, but we won't cover the meaningof those flags here.### How to see your changes#### JavaScript:If you use JupyterLab to develop then you can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in differentterminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the widget.```bash# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when neededyarn run watch# Run JupyterLab in another terminaljupyter lab```After a change wait for the build to finish and then refresh your browser and the changes should take effect.#### Python:If you make a change to the python code then you will need to restart the notebook kernel to have it take effect.</longdescription>
