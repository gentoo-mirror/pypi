	<longdescription># PyModbus - A Python Modbus StackPymodbus is a full Modbus protocol implementation using a synchronous orasynchronous core. The library consist of 4 parts:-   **client**, connect to your favorite device-   **server**, simulate your favorite device-   **repl**, a text based client/server simulator-   **simulator**, a html based server simulatorPymodbus:-   implement the modbus standard protocol, with the possibility to add    customizations.-   support serial (rs-485), tcp, tls and udp communication.-   support all standard frames: socket, rtu, rtu-over-tcp, tcp and    ascii.-   can be used without any third party dependencies (aside from    pyserial)-   is a very lightweight project.-   requires Python \&gt;= 3.8.-   provides a lot of ready to use examples.-   provides a server/client simulators.-   have a thorough test suite, that test all corners of the library.-   Tested automatically on Windows, Linux and MacOS with python 3.8 -    3.11The modbus protocol documentation is available`here &lt;_static/Modbus_Application_Protocol_V1_1b3.pdf&gt;`We are constantly working the modernize pymodbus and add new features,and we look for people who want to help a bit. There are challengessmall and large not only programming but also documentation and testing.[![image](https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus/actions/workflows/ci.yml)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pymodbus/badge/?version=latest)](https://pymodbus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/pymodbus)](https://pepy.tech/project/pymodbus)## Supported versionsVersion[3.5.4](https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus/releases/tag/v3.5.4) isthe current release.Each release is[documented](https://pymodbus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/changelog.html)A big thanks to all the[volunteers](https://pymodbus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/authors.html)that helped make pymodbus a great project.::: important::: titleImportant:::All API changes after 3.0.0 are documented in[API_changes.rst](https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.rst):::## Common features&gt; -   Full modbus standard protocol implementation&gt; -   Support for custom function codes&gt; -   Most of the extended protocol&gt;     (diagnostic/file/pipe/setting/information) also implemented&gt; -   TCP, RTU-OVER-TCP, UDP, TLS, Serial ASCII and Serial RTU## Client Features&gt; -   asynchronous and synchronous API for applications&gt; -   Payload builder/decoder utilities&gt; -   Pymodbus REPL for quick tests## Server Features&gt; -   Simulate real life devices&gt; -   asynchronous and synchronous versions&gt; -   Full server control context (device information, counters, etc)&gt; -   A number of backend datastores&gt; -   Pymodbus REPL for quick tests&gt; -   Pymodbus simulator for cloud based testing## Use CasesThe client is the most typically used. It is embedded into applications,where it abstract the modbus protocol from the application by providingan easy to use API. The client is integrated into some well knownprojects like [home-assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io).Although most system administrators will find little need for a Modbusserver on any modern hardware, they may find the need to query deviceson their network for status (PDU, PDR, UPS, etc). Since the library iswritten in python, it allows for easy scripting and/or integration intotheir existing solutions.Continuing, most monitoring software needs to be stress tested againsthundreds or even thousands of devices (why this was originally written),but getting access to that many is unwieldy at best.The pymodbus server will allow a user to test as many devices as theirbase operating system will allow.For more information please browse the project documentation:&lt;https://readthedocs.org/docs/pymodbus/en/latest/index.html&gt;## Example CodeFor those of you that just want to get started fast, here you go:    from pymodbus.client import ModbusTcpClient    client = ModbusTcpClient('MyDevice.lan')    client.connect()    client.write_coil(1, True)    result = client.read_coils(1,1)    print(result.bits[0])    client.close()We provide a couple of simple ready to go clients:-   [async    client](https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus/blob/dev/examples/simple_async_client.py)-   [sync    client](https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus/blob/dev/examples/simple_sync_client.py)For more advanced examples, check out the[Examples](https://pymodbus.readthedocs.io/en/dev/source/examples.html)included in the repository. If you have created any utilities that meeta specific need, feel free to submit them so others can benefit.    examples      -&gt; Essential examples guaranteed to work (tested with our CI)    ├── contrib   -&gt; Examples contributed by contributors.Also, if you have a question, please [create a post in discussions q&amp;atopic](https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus/discussions/new?category=q-a),so that others can benefit from the results.If you think, that something in the code is broken/not running well,please [open anissue](https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus/issues/new), read theTemplate-text first and then post your issue with your setupinformation.## Installing with pipYou can install using pip or easy install by issuing the followingcommands in a terminal window (make sure you have correct permissions ora virtualenv currently running):&gt; pip install -U pymodbusIf you want to use the serial interface:&gt; pip install -U pymodbus\[serial\]This will install pymodbus, rTo install pymodbus with options run:&gt; pip install -U pymodbus\[\&lt;option\&gt;,\...\]Available options are:-   **repl**, install dependencies needed by pymodbus.repl-   **serial**, installs serial drivers.-   **simulator**, install dependencies needed by pymodbus.simulator-   **documentation**, installs tools to generate documentation.-   **development**, installs development tools needed to enable    test/check of pymodbus changes.-   **all**, installs all of the above## Installing with githubBefore cloning the repo, you need to install python3 (preferable 3.11)and make and activate a virtual environment:    python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment    source .venv/bin/activateClone the source and install from there:    git clone git://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus.git    cd pymodbusTo get a specific release:    git checkout v3.5.2To get bleeding edge:    git checkout devInstall required development tools:    pip install -e &quot;.[development]&quot;    pre-commit installThis installs pymodbus in your virtual environment with pointersdirectly to the pymodbus directory, so any change you make isimmediately available as if installed. It will also install[pre-commit]{.title-ref} git hooks.The repository contains a number of important branches and tags.:   -   **dev** is where all development happens, this branch is not        always stable.    -   **master** is where are releases are kept.    -   All releases are tagged with **vX.Y.Z** (e.g. v2.5.3)If a maintenance release of an old version is needed (e.g. v2.5.4), therelease tag is used to create a branch with the same name, andmaintenance development is merged here.## Current Work In ProgressThe maintenance team is very small with limited capacity and few modbusdevices.If your company would like your device tested or have a cloud baseddevice simulation, feel free to contact us. We are happy to help yourcompany solve your modbus challenges.That said, the current work mainly involves polishing the library andsolving issues:&gt; -   Fixing bugs/feature requests&gt; -   Architecture documentation&gt; -   Functional testing against any reference we can find&gt; -   The remaining edges of the protocol (that we think no one uses)There are 2 bigger projects ongoing:&gt; -   rewriting the internal part of all clients (both sync and async)&gt; -   Make the simulator datastore THE datastore## Development InstructionsThe current code base is compatible python \&gt;= 3.8. Here are some of thecommon commands to perform a range of activities&gt; ./check_ci.sh run the same checks as CI runs on a pull request.## Generate documentation**Remark** Assumes that you have installed documentation tools:&gt; pip install -e \&quot;.\[documentation\]\&quot;to build do:&gt; cd doc ./build_htmlThe documentation is available in \&lt;root\&gt;/build/html/html## ContributingJust fork the repo and raise your PR against [dev]{.title-ref} branch.We always have more work than time, so feel free to open a discussion /issue on a theme you want to solve.## License InformationReleased under the [BSD License](LICENSE)</longdescription>
