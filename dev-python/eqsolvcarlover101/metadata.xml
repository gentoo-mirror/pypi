Quadratic    - ***eqsolve.quadsolve()***      &gt; To type a square in python, you need to use a carrot **^** or two astrix **. (Ex. 2x^2 -5x +4)2. Slope Intercept    - ***eqsolve.slopeint()***      &gt; Put in two points, and output an equation in slope-intercept form.3. Midpoint    - _**eqsolve.midpoint()**_      &gt; Put in two points and output the midpoint.4. Perpendicular Lines    - ***eqsolve.perpint()***      &gt; Put in the slope of a line, and the intersection point, and get the slope-intercept equation of the perpendicular line.5. Similar Shapes Check    - ***eqsolve.issim()***      &gt; Takes the lengths of the sides of one shape and the corresponding side lengths of the sides of a second shape.      &gt; If the shapes are similar, it will return the scale factor.6. Missing Right Triangle Lengths   - ***eqsolve.findright()***     &gt; Finds the missing length of a right triangle.7. Compounding Intersest   - ***eqsolve.intcompound(p,r,n,t)***     &gt; Calculates the amount of money present/money owed after a number of years using the provided interest rate and the number of times it is compounded yearly.8. Continuously Compounding Interest   - ***eqsolve.contcompound(p,r,t)***     &gt; Calculates the amount of money present/money owed after a number of years if the interest provided is compounded continuously.### Other Commands:1. Command List    - ***eqsolve.commands()***2. Help    - ***eqsolve.help()***## Version Info:- V0 - V1.5.2:    - To use these older versions, go to **Helpful Info** down below.- V1.6:    - Added _**eqsolve.intcompound()**_ and _**eqsolve.expcompound()**_ functions.    - Updated all function descriptions so they work with python's default ***help(function)***.    - Updated all functions to move away from ***input()*** towards proper function notation.    - Updated **README.md** so it reflects current statistics and project version info.## Helpful Info:- For previous versions and version error info, refer to [github (ver: oldest - current)](https://github.com/Carlover101/equation-solver) or [old pypi (ver: oldest - 1.5.1.0)](https://pypi.org/project/eqsolvcarlover101).## Thanks to all for using my work!</longdescription>
