Change things from this point onTaskFlow========.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/taskflow.svg    :target: https://pypi.org/project/taskflow/    :alt: Latest VersionA library to do [jobs, tasks, flows] in a highly available, easy to understandand declarative manner (and more!) to be used with OpenStack and otherprojects.* Free software: Apache license* Documentation: https://docs.openstack.org/taskflow/latest/* Source: https://opendev.org/openstack/taskflow* Bugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/taskflow/* Release notes: https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/taskflow/Join us-------- https://launchpad.net/taskflowTesting and requirements------------------------Requirements~~~~~~~~~~~~Because this project has many optional (pluggable) parts like persistencebackends and engines, we decided to split our requirements into twoparts: - things that are absolutely required (you can't use the projectwithout them) are put into ``requirements.txt``. The requirementsthat are required by some optional part of this project (you can use theproject without them) are put into our ``test-requirements.txt`` file (sothat we can still test the optional functionality works as expected). Ifyou want to use the feature in question (`eventlet`_ or the worker based enginethat uses `kombu`_ or the `sqlalchemy`_ persistence backend or jobboards whichhave an implementation built using `kazoo`_ ...), you should addthat requirement(s) to your project or environment.Tox.ini~~~~~~~Our ``tox.ini`` file describes several test environments that allow to testTaskFlow with different python versions and sets of requirements installed.Please refer to the `tox`_ documentation to understand how to make these testenvironments work for you.Developer documentation-----------------------We also have sphinx documentation in ``docs/source``.*To build it, run:*::    $ python setup.py build_sphinx.. _kazoo: https://kazoo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.. _sqlalchemy: https://www.sqlalchemy.org/.. _kombu: https://kombu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.. _eventlet: http://eventlet.net/.. _tox: https://tox.testrun.org/</longdescription>
