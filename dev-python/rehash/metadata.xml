	<longdescription>Rehash: Resumable Hashlib=========================Rehash is a resumable interface to the OpenSSL-based hashers (message digest objects) in theCPython ``hashlib`` standard library. Rehash provides hashers thatcan be pickled, persisted and reconstituted from their ``repr()``,and otherwise serialized. The rest of the Rehash API is identical to``hashlib``.Rehash hashers can be used to checkpoint and restore progresswhen hashing large byte streams:.. code-block:: python  import pickle, rehash  hasher = rehash.sha256(b&quot;foo&quot;)  state = pickle.dumps(hasher)  hasher2 = pickle.loads(state)  hasher2.update(b&quot;bar&quot;)  assert hasher2.hexdigest() == rehash.sha256(b&quot;foobar&quot;).hexdigest()Installation------------::    pip install rehashApplications~~~~~~~~~~~~Rehash is useful in any situation when your VM is short-lived or preemptible, and the object you're hashing is huge. Forexample, Rehash can be used to hand off the hashing state of large objects between AWS Lambda functions or Google CloudFunctions, which have runtime limits of 15 and 9 minutes, respectively... admonition:: Non-openssl hashers  ``sha3`` and ``blake2`` hash algorithms in Python 3.6 are not OpenSSL-based and not supported by rehash... admonition:: PyPy  PyPy uses its own hasher implementations. Those are not serializable using rehash... admonition:: Security note  By default, rehash objects present themselves with a ``repr()`` that exposes their internal state. This allows one to  resume the hashing from the point where it stopped. If exposed through an untrusted channel under specific conditions,  this could potentially allow an attacker to use an extension attack. If you are unsure about the implications of this,  set ``rehash.opaque_repr = True`` after importing rehash.Links-----* `Project home page (GitHub) &lt;https://github.com/kislyuk/rehash&gt;`_* `Documentation (Read the Docs) &lt;https://rehash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_* `Package distribution (PyPI) &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rehash&gt;`_* `Change log &lt;https://github.com/kislyuk/rehash/blob/master/Changes.rst&gt;`_Bugs~~~~Please report bugs, issues, feature requests, etc. on `GitHub &lt;https://github.com/kislyuk/rehash/issues&gt;`_.License-------Licensed under the terms of the `Apache License, Version 2.0 &lt;http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&gt;`_... image:: https://github.com/kislyuk/rehash/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg        :target: https://github.com/kislyuk/rehash/actions.. image:: https://codecov.io/github/kislyuk/rehash/coverage.svg?branch=master        :target: https://codecov.io/github/kislyuk/rehash?branch=master.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/rehash.svg        :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rehash.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/rehash.svg        :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rehash.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/rehash/badge/?version=latest        :target: https://rehash.readthedocs.org/</longdescription>
