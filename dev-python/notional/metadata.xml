This is loosely modeledafter concepts found in [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org) and[MongoEngine](http://mongoengine.org).  Built on the excellent[notion-sdk-py](https://github.com/ramnes/notion-sdk-py) library, this module provideshigher-level access to the API.&gt; :warning: **Work In Progress**: The interfaces in this module are still in developmentand are likely to change.
