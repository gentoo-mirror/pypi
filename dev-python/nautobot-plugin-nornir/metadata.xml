	<longdescription># ntc-nautobot-plugin-nornirA plugin for [Nautobot](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot), that intends to be a small shim layer between[nornir-nautobot](https://github.com/nautobot/nornir-nautobot) and other plugins. The primary abilities that the plugin provides is a native NornirORM based inventory and a credential manager.![Architecture Overview](./docs/img/architecture-overview.png)As of the writing of this readme, the only plugin leveraging this plugin is the [golden-config](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-golden-config). However, future plugins are planned, such as the &quot;network importer&quot;.That being said, there is currently little reason to install this plugin by itself, without an enabler, which can be seen represented as the whiterectangles inside the yellow rectangle in the diagram above. An enabler could be a Plugin, Job, or another piece of code like a Chatops command.# InstallationIf using the installation pattern from the Nautobot Documentation, you will need sudo to the `nautobot` user before installing so that you install the package into the Nautobot virtual environment.```no-highlightsudo -iu nautobot```The plugin is available as a Python package in PyPI and can be installed with `pip3`.```no-highlight$ pip3 install nautobot-plugin-nornir```To ensure the plugin is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (or append if it already exists) in the [`NAUTOBOT_ROOT`](https://nautobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/optional-settings/#nautobot_root) directory and list the `nautobot-plugin-nornir` package:```no-highlight$ echo nautobot-plugin-nornir &gt;&gt; $NAUTOBOT_ROOT/local_requirements.txt```&gt; The plugin is compatible with Nautobot 1.0.0 and higher Once installed, the plugin needs to be enabled in your `nautobot_config.py````python# In your nautobot_config.pyPLUGINS = [&quot;nautobot_plugin_nornir&quot;]PLUGINS_CONFIG = {    &quot;nautobot_plugin_nornir&quot;: {        &quot;use_config_context&quot;: {&quot;secrets&quot;, False, &quot;connection_options&quot;: True},        # Optionally set global connection options.        &quot;connection_options&quot;: {            &quot;napalm&quot;: {                &quot;extras&quot;: {                    &quot;optional_args&quot;: {&quot;global_delay_factor&quot;: 1},                },            },            &quot;netmiko&quot;: {                &quot;extras&quot;: {                    &quot;global_delay_factor&quot;: 1,                },            },        },        &quot;nornir_settings&quot;: {            &quot;credentials&quot;: &quot;nautobot_plugin_nornir.plugins.credentials.env_vars.CredentialsEnvVars&quot;,            &quot;runner&quot;: {                &quot;plugin&quot;: &quot;threaded&quot;,                &quot;options&quot;: {                    &quot;num_workers&quot;: 20,                },            },        },    }}```Alternatively you can use the `CredentialsSettingsVars` class to set the username and password via settings.```pythonPLUGINS_CONFIG = {    &quot;nautobot_plugin_nornir&quot;: {        # ...        &quot;dispatcher_mapping&quot;: None,        &quot;username&quot;: &quot;ntc&quot;,        &quot;password&quot;: &quot;password123&quot;,        &quot;secret&quot;: &quot;password123&quot;,    }}```The plugin behavior can be controlled with the following list of settings. | Key     | Example | Default | Description                          || ------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------- || nornir_settings | {&quot;nornir_settings&quot;: { &quot;credentials&quot;: &quot;cred_path&quot;}} | N/A | The expected configuration paramters that Nornir uses, see Nornir documentation. || dispatcher_mapping | {&quot;newos&quot;: &quot;dispatcher.newos&quot;} | None | A dictionary in which the key is a platform slug and the value is the import path of the dispatcher in string format || username | ntc | N/A | The username when leveraging the `CredentialsSettingsVars` credential provider. || password | password123 | N/A | The password when leveraging the `CredentialsSettingsVars` credential provider. || secret | password123 | N/A | The secret password when leveraging the `CredentialsSettingsVars` credential provider.|| connection_options | N/A | {&quot;netmiko&quot;: {&quot;extras&quot;: {&quot;global_delay_factor&quot;: 1}}} | Set Nornir connection options globally to be used with **all** connections.| use_config_context | {&quot;secrets&quot;: True, &quot;connection_options&quot;: True} | {&quot;secrets&quot;: False, &quot;connection_options&quot;: False} | Whether to pull Secret Access Type, and/or Connection Options from Config Context.|The plugin behavior can be extended further with [config context](https://nautobot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models/extras/gitrepository/#configuration-contexts) data. The plugin currently implements two options: Nornir connection options, and secrets.  The supported settings are listed below.The root key for this plugin is `nautobot_plugin_nornir`.| Key     | Description                          || ------- | ------------------------------------ || connection_options | Dictionary representation of a Nornir Plugins connection options. || connection_secret_path | Dotted expression of the dictionary path where a device secret should be stored for a given Nornir Plugin. || secret_access_type | Type of Secret Access Type to use. Examples. &quot;GENERIC&quot;, &quot;CONSOLE&quot;, &quot;GNMI&quot;, &quot;HTTP&quot;, &quot;NETCONF&quot;, &quot;REST&quot;, &quot;RESTCONF&quot;, &quot;SNMP&quot;, &quot;SSH&quot;|By default the device secret connection option path will be set for connections using: Napalm, Netmiko, and Scrapli.  If an additional path needs to be registered it can be done by setting it inside the config context data.  See below for an example.```yaml---_metadata:  name: spine  weight: 1000  description: Group Definitions for device type SPINE  is_active: true  device-roles:    - slug: spinenautobot_plugin_nornir:  pluginx:    connection_secret_path: &quot;pluginx.extras.secret&quot;```Finally, as root, restart Nautobot and the Nautobot worker.```no-highlight$ sudo systemctl restart nautobot nautobot-worker```## Setting `dispatcher_mapping`The `dispatcher_mapping` configuration option can be set to extend or map the platform slug to a proper nornir class.```json {  &quot;dispatcher_mapping&quot;: {    &quot;newos&quot;: &quot;dispatcher.newos&quot;,    &quot;ios&quot;: &quot;nornir_nautobot.plugins.tasks.dispatcher.cisco_ios.NautobotNornirDriver&quot;,    &quot;ios_xe&quot;: &quot;nornir_nautobot.plugins.tasks.dispatcher.cisco_ios.NautobotNornirDriver&quot;,    &quot;fortinet&quot;: &quot;nornir_nautobot.plugins.tasks.dispatcher.default.NetmikoNautobotNornirDriver&quot;,  }}```The above example demonstrates the following use cases.* Creating a custom only local dispatcher* Mapping a user defined and preferred platform slug name to expected driver (e.g. ios -&gt; cisco_ios)* Overloading platform slug keys, by mapping ios and ios_xe to the same class* Leveraging the existing &quot;default&quot; Netmiko driverPlugin developers that leverage the plugin, are recommended to use the `get_dispatcher` function in `nautobot_plugin_nornir.utils` file to provide the ability toallow users to define their own mappings as described above.# InventoryThe Nautobot ORM inventory is rather static in nature at this point. The user has the ability to define the `default` data. The native capabilitiesinclude. * Providing an object called within the `obj` key that is a Nautobot `Device` object instance.* Provide additional keys for hostname, name, id, type, site, role, config_context, and custom_field_data.* Provide grouping for global, site, role, type, and manufacturer based on their slug.* Provide credentials for NAPALM and Netmiko.* Link to the credential class as defined by the `nornir_settings['settings']` definition.  - Enabling the use of Config Context:  ```python  PLUGINS_CONFIG = {  &quot;nautobot_plugin_nornir&quot;: {    &quot;use_config_context&quot;: {&quot;connection_options&quot;: True},    &quot;nornir_settings&quot;: {      &quot;credentials&quot;: &quot;nautobot_plugin_nornir.plugins.credentials.nautobot_secrets.CredentialsNautobotSecrets&quot;,      # ...    }  }  }  ```  - Local Device Config Context:    ```json    {&quot;nautobot_plugin_nornir&quot;: {            &quot;connection_options&quot;: {                &quot;napalm&quot;: {                    &quot;extras&quot;: {                        &quot;optional_args&quot;: {                            &quot;global_delay_factor&quot;: 5                        }                    }                }            }        }    }  ```    - Device Type Config Context:  ```yaml  ---  _metadata:    name: spine    weight: 1000    description: Group Definitions for device type SPINE    is_active: true    device-roles:      - slug: spine  nautobot_plugin_nornir:    connection_options:      napalm:        extras:          optional_args:            global_delay_factor: 5  ```# CredentialsThere is a `NautobotORMCredentials` class that describes what methods a Nautobot Nornir credential class should have.```pythonclass NautobotORMCredentials:    &quot;&quot;&quot;Abstract Credentials Class designed to work with Nautobot ORM.&quot;&quot;&quot;    def get_device_creds(self, device):        &quot;&quot;&quot;Return the credentials for a given device.        Args:            device (dcim.models.Device): Nautobot device object        Return:            username (string):            password (string):            secret (string):        &quot;&quot;&quot;        return (None, None, None)    def get_group_creds(self, group_name):        &quot;&quot;&quot;Return the credentials for a given group.        Args:            group_name (string): Name of the group        Return:            string: username            string: password            string: secret        &quot;&quot;&quot;        return (None, None, None)```Any custom credential class should inherit from this model and provide get_device_creds and/or get_group_creds methods. Currently, only theget_device_creds is used. Building your own custom credential class allows users to control their own credential destiny. As an example, a user couldintegrate with their own vaulting system, and obtain credentials that way. To provide a simple but concrete example.```pythonclass CustomNautobotORMCredentials(NautobotORMCredentials):    def get_device_creds(self, device):        if device.startswith('csr'):            return (&quot;cisco&quot;, &quot;cisco123&quot;, None)        return (&quot;net-admin&quot;, &quot;ops123&quot;, None)```You would have to set your `nornir_settings['credentials']` path to your custom class, such as `local_plugin.creds.CustomNautobotORMCredentials`.Out of the box, users have access to three classes:- `nautobot_plugin_nornir.plugins.credentials.settings_vars.CredentialsSettingsVars`  - Leverages the username, password, secret that is specified in the plugin configuration.- `nautobot_plugin_nornir.plugins.credentials.env_vars.CredentialsEnvVars`  - Leverages the environment variables `NAPALM_USERNAME`, `NAPALM_PASSWORD`, and `DEVICE_SECRET`.- `nautobot_plugin_nornir.plugins.credentials.nautobot_secrets.CredentialsNautobotSecrets`  - Leverages the [Nautobot Secrets Group](https://nautobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core-functionality/secrets/#secrets-groups) core functionality.  **The default assumes Secrets Group contain secrets with &quot;Access Type&quot; of `Generic`** and expects these secrets to have &quot;Secret Type&quot; of `username`, `password`, and optionally `secret`. The &quot;Access Type&quot; is configurable via the plugin configuration parameter `use_config_context`, which if enabled changes the plugin functionality to pull `device_obj.get_config_context()['nautobot_plugin_nornir']['secret_access_type']` from each devices config_context. Which is the config context dictionary `nautobot_plugin_nornir` and the subkey of `secret_access_type`.  - Enabling the use of Config Context:  ```python  PLUGINS_CONFIG = {  &quot;nautobot_plugin_nornir&quot;: {    &quot;use_config_context&quot;: {&quot;secrets&quot;: True},    &quot;nornir_settings&quot;: {      &quot;credentials&quot;: &quot;nautobot_plugin_nornir.plugins.credentials.nautobot_secrets.CredentialsNautobotSecrets&quot;,      # ...    }  }  }  ```  - Local Device Config Context:  ```json  {&quot;nautobot_plugin_nornir&quot;: {&quot;secret_access_type&quot;: &quot;SSH&quot;}}  ```    - Device Type Config Context:  ```yaml  ---  _metadata:    name: spine    weight: 1000    description: Group Definitions for device type SPINE    is_active: true    device-roles:      - slug: spine  nautobot_plugin_nornir:    secret_access_type: SSH  ```&gt; For any of these classes, if a &quot;secret&quot; value is not defined, the &quot;password&quot; will also be used as the &quot;secret&quot; value.The environment variable must be accessible on the web service. This often means simply exporting the environment variable will not suffice, but instead requiring users to update the `nautobot.service` file, however this will ultimately depend on your own setup. Environmentvariables are distinctively not nautobot configuration parameters (in `naubot_config.py`), if that does not makes sense, expect to see authentication issues.```[Service]Environment=&quot;NAPALM_USERNAME=ntc&quot;Environment=&quot;NAPALM_PASSWORD=password123&quot;Environment=&quot;DEVICE_SECRET=password123&quot;```# ContributingPull requests are welcomed and automatically built and tested against multiple version of Python and multiple version of Nautobot through TravisCI.The project is packaged with a light development environment based on `docker-compose` to help with the local development of the project and to run the tests within TravisCI.The project is following Network to Code software development guideline and is leveraging:- Black, Pylint, Bandit and pydocstyle for Python linting and formatting.- Django unit test to ensure the plugin is working properly.# CLI Helper CommandsThe project is coming with a CLI helper based on [invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) to help setup the development environment. The commands are listed below in 3 categories `dev environment`, `utility` and `testing`. Each command can be executed with `invoke &lt;command&gt;`. All commands support the arguments `--nautobot-ver` and `--python-ver` if you want to manually define the version of Python and Nautobot to use. Each command also has its own help `invoke &lt;command&gt; --help`## Local dev environment```  build            Build all docker images.  debug            Start Nautobot and its dependencies in debug mode.  destroy          Destroy all containers and volumes.  restart          Restart Nautobot and its dependencies.  start            Start Nautobot and its dependencies in detached mode.  stop             Stop Nautobot and its dependencies.```## Utility ```  cli              Launch a bash shell inside the running Nautobot container.  create-user      Create a new user in django (default: admin), will prompt for password.  makemigrations   Run Make Migration in Django.  nbshell          Launch a nbshell session.```## Testing ```  bandit           Run bandit to validate basic static code security analysis.  black            Run black to check that Python files adhere to its style standards.  flake8           This will run flake8 for the specified name and Python version.  pydocstyle       Run pydocstyle to validate docstring formatting adheres to NTC defined standards.  pylint           Run pylint code analysis.  tests            Run all tests for this plugin.  unittest         Run Django unit tests for the plugin.```# QuestionsFor any questions or comments, please check the [FAQ](FAQ.md) first and feel free to swing by the [Network to Code slack channel](https://networktocode.slack.com/) (channel #networktocode).Sign up [here](http://slack.networktocode.com/)</longdescription>
