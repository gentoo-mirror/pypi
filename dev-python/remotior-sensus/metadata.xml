this avoids the time required to produce a unique raster output.Most tools allow for on the fly reprojection of input data.Machine Learning________________Remotior Sensus optional dependencies are `PyTorch &lt;https://pytorch.org/&gt;`_and `scikit-learn &lt;https://scikit-learn.org/stable/&gt;`_, which areintegrated in the classification tool.to allow for land cover classification through machine learning.The aim is to simplify the training process and development of the model.Installation______________Remotior Sensus requires `GDAL`, `NumPy` and `SciPy` for most functionalities.Also, `scikit-learn` and `PyTorch` are optional but required for machine learning.Optionally, `Matplotlib` is used to display spectral signature plots.It is recommended to install Remotior Sensus using a `Conda` environment... code-block:: console    $ conda install -c conda-forge remotior-sensus scikit-learn pytorchLicense of Remotior Sensus''''''''''''''''''''''''''Remotior Sensus is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify itunder the terms of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License,or (at your option) any later version.Remotior Sensus is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;
