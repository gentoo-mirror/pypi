In preparation.## OverviewIf you find this code useful in producing published works, please provide anappropriate citation. Note that the second citation is focused on addingfeatures that make use of GPR models based on derivative information produced bythe core code base. For now, the GPR code, along with more information, may befound under [here][gpr-link]. In a future release, we expect this to be fullyintegrated into the code base rather than a standalone module.Code included here can be used to perform thermodynamic extrapolation andinterpolation of observables calculated from molecular simulations. This allowsfor more efficient use of simulation data for calculating how observables changewith simulation conditions, including temperature, density, pressure, chemicalpotential, or force field parameters. Users are highly encourage to work throughthe [Jupyter Notebooks][notebook-link] presenting examples for a variety ofdifferent observable functional forms. We only guarantee that this code isfunctional for the test cases we present here or for which it has previouslybeen applied Additionally, the code may be in continuous development at anytime. Use at your own risk and always check to make sure the produced resultsmake sense. If bugs are found, please report them. If specific features would behelpful just let us know and we will be happy to work with you to come up with asolution.## Features- Fast calculation of derivatives## StatusThis package is actively used by the author. Please feel free to create a pullrequest for wanted features and suggestions!## Quick start`thermoextrap` may be installed with either (recommended)```bashconda install -c wpk-nist thermoextrap```or```bashpip install thermoextrap```If you use pip, then you can include additional dependencies using```bashpip install thermoextrap[all]```If you install `thermoextrap` with conda, there are additional optionaldependencies that take some care for installation. We recommend installing thefollowing via `pip`, as the versions on the conda/conda-forge channels are oftena bit old.```bashpip install tensorflow tensorflow-probability gpflow```To install from source do the following:```bashgit clone git@github.com:usnistgov/thermoextrap.gitcd thermoextrappip install . [-e]```To (optionally) include the example data do the following:```bashgit submodule update --init  --recursive```## Example usage```pythonimport thermoextrap```&lt;!-- end-docs --&gt;## DocumentationSee the [documentation][docs-link] for a look at `thermoextrap` in action.To have a look at using `thermoextrap` with Gaussian process regression, look inthe [gpr](examples/usage/gpr) and[gpr_active_learning](examples/gpr_active_learning) directories.## LicenseThis is free software.

These were imported at top level anyway. This fixes issues with doing things  like `from thermoextrap.data import ...`, etc.- Moved `core._docstrings_` to `docstrings`.- Now using `cmomy.docstrings` instead of repeating them here.Full set of changes:[`v0.2.2...v0.3.0`](https://github.com/usnistgov/thermoextrap/compare/v0.2.2...0.3.0)## v0.2.2 - 2023-04-05Full set of changes:[`v0.2.1...v0.2.2`](https://github.com/usnistgov/thermoextrap/compare/v0.2.1...v0.2.2)## v0.2.1 - 2023-03-30Full set of changes:[`v0.2.0...v0.2.1`](https://github.com/usnistgov/thermoextrap/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1)## v0.2.0 - 2023-03-28Full set of changes:[`v0.1.9...v0.2.0`](https://github.com/usnistgov/thermoextrap/compare/v0.1.9...v0.2.0)## v0.1.9 - 2023-02-15Full set of changes:[`v0.1.8...v0.1.9`](https://github.com/usnistgov/thermoextrap/compare/v0.1.8...v0.1.9)## v0.1.8 - 2023-02-15Full set of changes:[`v0.1.7...v0.1.8`](https://github.com/usnistgov/thermoextrap/compare/v0.1.7...v0.1.8)## v0.1.7 - 2023-02-14This software was developed by employees of the National Institute of Standardsand Technology (NIST), an agency of the Federal Government.
