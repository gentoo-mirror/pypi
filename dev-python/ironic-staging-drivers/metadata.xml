	<longdescription>======================Ironic Staging Drivers======================The Ironic Staging Drivers is used to hold out-of-tree Ironic driverswhich doesn't have means to provide a 3rd Party CI at this point intime which is required by Ironic.The intention of this project is to provide a common place for usefuldrivers resolving the &quot;hundreds of different download sites&quot; problem.What the Ironic Staging Drivers is not---------------------------------------* The Ironic Staging Drivers is **not** a project under Ironic's  governance, meaning that the Ironic core group is **not responsible**  for the code in this project (even though, some individuals that work in  this project also hold core status in the Ironic project).* This project is **not** a place to dump code and run away hoping that  someone else will take care of it for you. Drivers included  in this project should be maintained and have their bugs fixed  quickly. Therefore, driver owners are going to be asked to &quot;babysit&quot;  their driver.How to contribute-----------------We want to make sure that the Ironic Staging Drivers project is awelcoming and friendly place to contribute code. Therefore, we want toavoid bureaucratic processes as much as possible. If you want to proposea driver to be included in the repository: Just submit the code!How do I submit the code?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^#.
