Compile the cython module kinematic_wave_parallel_toolTo compile this Cython module to enable OpenMP multithreading (parallel kinematic wave):* Delete the files *.so (if any) in directory hydrological-modules  * Inside the hydrological_modules folder, execute &quot;python compile_kinematic_wave_parallel_tools.py build_ext --inplace&quot;  Important: the module has to be compiled on the machine where the model is run - the resulting binary is not portable.  Then in the settings file the option &quot;numberParallelThreadsKinematicWave&quot; may take the following values:    - &quot;0&quot;           : auto-detection of the machine/node's number of CPUs (all CPUs are used minus 1) (do not set it if other simulations are running on the same machine/node)    - &quot;1&quot;           : serial execution (not parallel)    - &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, ... : manual setting of the number of parallel threads.                      (if exceeding the number of CPUs, the option is set to &quot;0&quot;) --&gt;  ```xml&lt;textvar name=&quot;numCPUs_parallelKinematicWave&quot; value=&quot;3&quot;/&gt;```4. Run a cold run for the test catchmentNow your environment should be set up to run lisflood. Try with a prepared settings file for one of the two test catchments:```bashpython src/lisf1.py tests/data/LF_ETRS89_UseCase/settings/cold.xml```If the command above successed without errors, producing dis.nc into tests/data/LF_ETRS89_UseCase/out folder, your lisflood installation was correct.### Docker imageYou can use the updated docker image to run lisflood, so without taking care to install dependencies on your system.#### Pull image from repository:```bashdocker pull jrce1/lisflood:latest```#### Run test catchments in image:```bashdocker run -v /absolute_path/to/my/local/folder:/usecases jrce1/lisflood:latest usecases```After this command, you can find all files to run tests against catchments under the directory you mapped: `/absolute_path/to/my/local/folder/````/absolute_path/to/my/local/folder/LF_ETRS89_UseCase/absolute_path/to/my/local/folder/LF_lat_lon_UseCase```Now, you can run LISFLOOD as a docker container to test included catchments. Only thing you need to do is to map the test catchment folder to the container folder `input`, by using -v option. In the XML settings file, all paths are adjusted to be relative to the very same settings file, so you don't need to edit paths, as long as you keep same folders structure.#### Execute lisflood with a Docker image:```bashdocker run -v /absolute_path/to/my/local/folder/LF_ETRS89_UseCase:/input jrce1/lisflood /input/settings/cold.xml```Once LISFLOOD finished, you find reported maps in `/absolute_path/to/my/local/folder/LF_ETRS89_UseCase/out/` folder.### Pypi packaged LISFLOODLISFLOOD is also distributed as a standard python package. You can install the pip package in your Python 3 virtualenv:```bashpip install lisflood-model```Command above will also install the executable `lisflood` in the virtualenv, so that you can run LISFLOOD with the following:```bashlisflood /absolute_path/to/my/local/folder/LF_ETRS89_UseCase/settings/cold.xml```### IMPORTANT NOTE 1Please note that there are known issues when installing the LISFLOOD code on Windows (source code and pypi package). We cannot provide Windows support and strongly recommend using LINUX to install the LISFLOOD code.Windows users are recommended to execute LISFLOOD with a Docker image.### IMPORTANT NOTE 2The users are recommended to download the [reference settings xml](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-code/tree/master/src/lisfloodSettings_reference.xml) file and adapt it by inserting their own paths and modelling choices.## CollaborateIf you find an issue in our code, please follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to propose your changes (Fork, commit your changes and ask for a Pull Request).You are required to run unit tests during your development and before to propose a pull request.To execute unit tests:```bashpytest tests/```Furthermore, before to propose a pull request, there are additional tests we ask you to execute: ```bashpytest tests/ -m &quot;slow&quot;```These tests could take 30 minutes or several hours, depending on your machine.You can find full description and implementation details at [Test documentation](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-code/4_annex_tests/) page.**Note**: If yuor pull request is about a new feature you may want to integrate in LISFLOOD,ensure to include tests with good coverage for it.For more info about pytest, see [official website](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).</longdescription>
