This dataset has offered anunprecedented opportunity to examine the genetic underpinnings of the humanbrain, and has already yielded novel insight into e.g., `adolescent braindevelopment &lt;https://www.pnas.org/content/113/32/9105.long&gt;`__ and `functionalbrain organization &lt;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6240/1241.long&gt;`__.However, in order to be effectively used in most analyses, the AHBA microarrayexpression data often needs to be (1) collapsed into regions of interest (e.g.,parcels or networks), and (2) combined across donors. While this maypotentially seem trivial, there are a number of analytic choices in these stepsthat can dramatically influence the resulting data and any downstream analyses.Arnatkeviƒçi≈´te et al., 2019 provided a thorough treatment of this in a `recentmanuscript &lt;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919300114&gt;`__, demonstrating how the techniques and code used toprepare the raw AHBA data have varied widely across published reports.The current Python package, ``abagen``, aims to provide reproducible workflowsfor processing and preparing the AHBA microarray expression data for analysis... _readme_requirements:Installation requirements-------------------------Currently, ``abagen`` works with Python 3.6+ and requires a few dependencies:    - nibabel    - numpy (&gt;=1.14.0)    - pandas (&gt;=0.25.0), and    - scipyThere are some additional (optional) dependencies you can install to speed upsome functions:    - fastparquet, and    - python-snappyThese latter packages are primarily used to facilitate loading the (ratherlarge!) microarray expression dataframes provided by the Allen Institute,For detailed information on how to install ``abagen``, including thesedependencies, refer to our `installation instructions`_... _readme_usage:Quickstart----------At it's core, using ``abagen`` is as simple as:.. code-block:: python    &gt;&gt;&gt; import abagen    &gt;&gt;&gt; expression = abagen.get_expression_data('myatlas.nii.gz')where ``'myatlas.nii.gz'`` points to a brain parcellation file.This function can also be called from the command line with:.. code-block:: bash    $ abagen --output-file expression.csv myatlas.nii.gzFor more detailed instructions on how to use ``abagen`` please refer to our`user guide`_!.. _readme_development:Development and getting involved--------------------------------If you've found a bug, are experiencing a problem, or have a question aboutusing the package, please head on over to our `GitHub issues`_ and make a newissue with some information about it! Someone will try and get back to youas quickly as possible, though please note that the primary developer for``abagen`` (@rmarkello) is a graduate student so responses make take some time!If you're interested in getting involved in the project: welcome |sparkles|!We're thrilled to welcome new contributors. You should start by reading our`code of conduct`_; all activity on ``abagen`` should adhere to the CoC. Afterthat, take a look at our `contributing guidelines`_ so you're familiar with theprocesses we (generally) try to follow when making changes to the repository!Once you're ready to jump in head on over to our issues to see if there'sanything you might like to work on... _readme_acknowledgments:Citing ``abagen``-----------------For up-to-date instructions on how to cite abagen please refer to our`documentation &lt;https://abagen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/citing.html&gt;`_... _readme_licensing:License Information-------------------This codebase is licensed under the `3-clause BSD license`_.
