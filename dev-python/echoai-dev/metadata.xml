	<longdescription># EchoAI DEV: The command line tool to interface with Generative AI## Install```bashpip install openai-dev```## UsageThis cli depends on `openai` and it needs to be configured with your OpenAI API token. ```bashexport OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'```Once that's done, you can use the `echoai` command-line tool to interface with Generative AI. Here is an example of how you can use it:```bashechoai &quot;Why does the Python live on land?&quot;```This will generate a response from the Generative AI that hopefully answers the question. Of course, the quality of the response will depend on the specific model and prompt used.&gt; Disclaimer: AI jokes may not be funny to human beings. Use at your own risk.### OpenAI environment variables. The `echoai` cli works with the environment variables set for OpenAI. If you use Azure endpoints, you can set your `OPENAI_API_TYPE`, `_VERSION`, `_ENGINE` and `_BASE` according to your Azure project.## TestingInstall unittest and run `python -m unittest discover`</longdescription>
