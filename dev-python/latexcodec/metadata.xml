Since it is not a LaTeX compiler, it is moreappropriate for short chunks of text, such as a paragraph or thevalues of a BibTeX entry, and it is not appropriate for a full LaTeXdocument. In particular, its behavior on the LaTeX commands that donot simply select characters is intended to allow the unicoderepresentation to be understandable by a human reader, but is notcanonical and may require hand tuning to produce the desired effect.The encoder does a best effort to replace unicode characters outsideof the range used as LaTeX input (ascii by default) with a LaTeXcommand that selects the character. More technically, the unicode codepoint is replaced by a LaTeX command that selects a glyph thatreasonably represents the code point. Unicode characters with specialuses in LaTeX are replaced by their LaTeX equivalents. For example,====================== ===================original text          encoded LaTeX====================== ===================``짜``                  ``\yen````체``                  ``\&quot;u````\N{NO-BREAK SPACE}`` ``~````~``                  ``\textasciitilde````%``                  ``\%````#``                  ``\#````\textbf{x}``         ``\textbf{x}``====================== ===================The decoder does a best effort to replace LaTeX commands that selectcharacters with the unicode for the character they are selecting. Forexample,===================== ======================original LaTeX        decoded unicode===================== ======================``\yen``              ``짜````\&quot;u``               ``체````~``                 ``\N{NO-BREAK SPACE}````\textasciitilde``   ``~````\%``                ``%````\#``                ``#````\textbf{x}``        ``\textbf {x}````#``                 ``#``===================== ======================In addition, comments are dropped (including the final newline thatmarks the end of a comment), paragraphs are canonicalized into doublenewlines, and other newlines are left as is. Spacing after LaTeXcommands is also canonicalized.For example,::  hi % bye  there\par world  \textbf     {awesome}is decoded as::  hi there  world  \textbf {awesome}When decoding, LaTeX commands not directly selecting characters (forexample, macros and formatting commands) are passed throughunchanged. The same happens for LaTeX commands that select charactersbut are not yet recognized by the codec.  Either case can result in ahybrid unicode string in which some characters are understood asliterally the character and others as parts of unexpanded commands.Consequently, at times, backslashes will be left intact for denotingthe start of a potentially unrecognized control sequence.Given the numerous and changing packages providing such LaTeXcommands, the codec will never be complete, and new translations ofunrecognized unicode or unrecognized LaTeX symbols are always welcome.</longdescription>
