The Given steps to skip the address and port tests when running under  GitHub actions are not part of the testinfra-bdd package itself, but are  required as GitHub/Azure does not allow Ping/ICMP traffic.  Scenario: Skip Tests if Host is Windoze    Given the TestInfra host with URL &quot;docker://sut&quot; is ready within 10 seconds    # The system property can be one of:    #   - type (e.g. linux).    #   - distribution (e.g. debian).    #   - release (e.g. 11).    #   - codename (e.g. bullseye).    #   - arch (e.g. x86_64).    #   - hostname (e.g. sut).    #   - connection_type (e.g. docker or ssh).

The name and code is up to the user to develop.  However, the target    fixture must be called 'expected_value'.    &quot;&quot;&quot;    return 'foo'```## &quot;Given&quot; StepsGiven steps require that the URL of the system to be tested (SUT) is provided.This URL should comply to the connection string for the [Testinfra connectionstring](https://testinfra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends.html) (e.g.docker://my-host).  Please note that the URL _must_ be enclosed in doublequotes.Examples:To connect to a Docker container called sut (fail if the target host isnot ready):```gherkinGiven the TestInfra host with URL &quot;docker://java11&quot; is ready```To connect to a Docker container called sut but give it 60 seconds to becomeready, use the following:```gherkinGiven the TestInfra host with URL &quot;docker://sut&quot; is ready within 60 seconds```If the host does not become available after 60 seconds, fail the tests.### Writing a customized &quot;Given&quot; StepIt may be that you may want to create a customized &quot;Given&quot; step.  An examplecould be that the hosts to be tested may be parametrized.  The &quot;Given&quot; stepmust return a target fixture called &quot;testinfra_bdd_host&quot; so that the rest ofthe Testinfra BDD fixtures will function.  This fixture is a instance of the`testinfra_bdd.`The &quot;Given&quot; step should also ascertain that the target host is ready (onecan use the `is_host_ready` function for that).An example is:```pythonfrom pytest_bdd import givenfrom testinfra_bdd import TestinfraBDD@given('my host is ready', target_fixture='testinfra_bdd_host')def my_host_is_ready():    &quot;&quot;&quot;    Specify that the target host is a docker container called    &quot;my-host&quot; and wait up to 60 seconds for the host to be ready.    &quot;&quot;&quot;    host = TestinfraBDD('docker://my-host')    assert host.is_host_ready(60), 'My host is not ready.'    return host...```## &quot;When&quot; StepsWhen steps require that a &quot;Given&quot; step has been executed beforehand.  Theyallow the user to either skip tests if the host does not match an expectedprofile.  They also allow the user to specify which resource or is to betested.### Skip Tests if Host Profile Does Not MatchIt may be useful to skip tests if you find that the system under test doesn'tmatch an expected profile (e.g. the system is not debian as expected).  Thiscan be achieved by comparing against the following configurations:- The OS Type (e.g. linux).- The distribution name (e.g. debian).- The OS release (e.g. 11).- The OS codename if relevant (e.g. bullseye).- The host architecture (e.g. x86_64).- The hostname (e.g. sut)Example:```gherkin  Scenario: Skip Tests if Host is Windoze    Given the TestInfra host with URL &quot;docker://sut&quot; is ready within 10 seconds    When the TestInfra system property type is not Windoze skip tests```## Upgrading from 2.Y.Z to 3.0.0We introduced a number of breaking changes, namely:- A change to the Domain Specific Language (DSL).- Moving to TestInfra 9 and dropping support for 6, 7 and 8.- Dropping support for EOL versions of Python (3.6, 3.7 and 3.8).The changes for the DSL are pretty basic.  We identified a need to namespacethe TestInfra tests to stop clashes with other BDD feature code.  If yourold code looked something like:```gherkin  Scenario: System Package    Given the host with URL &quot;docker://sut&quot; is ready    When the package is ntp    Then the package is installed```Then change the code to:```gherkin  Scenario: System Package    Given the TestInfra host with URL &quot;docker://sut&quot; is ready    When the TestInfra package is ntp    Then the TestInfra package is installed```All example code above has been updated to the new format for guidance.## Upgrading from 1.Y.Z to 2.0.0We split the single package into multiple source files.  This means a minorbut nonetheless breaking change in your step definitions (all feature filescan remain as they are).  The change is how one sets `pytest_plugins`.### Old Code```pythonpytest_plugins = ['testinfra_bdd']```### New Code```pythonpytest_plugins = testinfra_bdd.PYTEST_MODULES```</longdescription>
