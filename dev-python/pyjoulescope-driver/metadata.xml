The first-generation driver introduced in 2019 waswritten in Python.  While Python proved to be a very flexible language enablingmany user scripts, it was difficult to support other languages.  This second-generation driver launched in 2022 addresses several issueswith the first-generation python driver including:1. Improved event-driven API based upon PubSub for easier integration with    user interfaces and other complicated software packages.2. Improved portability for easier language bindings.3. Improved performance.For more information, see:* [source code](https://github.com/jetperch/joulescope_driver)* [documentation](https://joulescope-driver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)* [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pyjoulescope-driver/)* [Joulescope](https://www.joulescope.com/) (Joulescope web store)* [jls](https://github.com/jetperch/jls) (Joulescope file format)* [forum](https://forum.joulescope.com/)## BuildingEnsure that your computer has a development environment including CMake.  ### WindowsInstall cmake and your favorite build toolchain such as Visual Studio, mingw64, wsl, ninja.### macOSFor macOS, install homebrew, then:    brew install pkgconfig python3### Ubuntu 22.04 LTSFor Ubuntu:    sudo apt install cmake build-essential ninja-build### Common    cd {your/repos/joulescope_driver}    mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build    cmake ..    cmake --build . &amp;&amp; ctest .This package includes a command-line tool, jsdrv_util:    jsdrv_util --help    jsdrv_util scan## Python bindingsThe python bindings are made to work with Python 3.9 and later.  To installthe dependencies:    cd {your/repos/joulescope_driver}    pip3 install -U requirements.txtYou should then be able to build the native bindings:    python3 setup.py build_ext --inplaceOn Windows, you may be prompted to install the [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).You may also need to use &quot;python&quot; rather than &quot;python3&quot; on some platforms.And run the Python tools:    python3 -m pyjoulescope_driver --help    python3 -m pyjoulescope_driver scan    python3 -m pyjoulescope_driver info    python3 -m pyjoulescope_driver info * --verboseYou may optionally choose to use a Python virtual environment.</longdescription>
