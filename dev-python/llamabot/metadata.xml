	<longdescription># LLaMaBot: A Pythonic bot interface to LLMsLLaMaBot implements a Pythonic interface to LLMs,making it much easier to experiment with LLMs in a Jupyter notebookand build simple utility apps that utilize LLMs.The model that we default to using is OpenAI's largest GPT-4 model.## Install LLaMaBotTo install LLaMaBot:```pythonpip install llamabot```## How to use### Obtain an OpenAI API keyObtain an OpenAI API key and set it as the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.(Here's a [reference][envvar] on what an environment variable is, if you're not sure.)[envvar]: https://ericmjl.github.io/essays-on-data-science/software-skills/environment-variables/We recommend setting the environment variable in a `.env` filein the root of your project repository.From there, `llamabot` will automagically load the environment variable for you.### Simple BotThe simplest use case of LLaMaBotis to create a simple bot that keeps no record of chat history.This is effectively the same as a _stateless function_that you program with natural language instructions rather than code.This is useful for prompt experimentation,or for creating simple bots that are preconditioned on an instruction to handle textsand are then called upon repeatedly with different texts.For example, to create a Bot that explains a given chunk of textlike Richard Feynman would:```pythonfrom llamabot import SimpleBotfeynman = SimpleBot(&quot;You are Richard Feynman. You will be given a difficult concept, and your task is to explain it back.&quot;)```Now, `feynman` is callable on any arbitrary chunk of text and will return a rephrasing of that text in Richard Feynman's style (or more accurately, according to the style prescribed by the prompt).For example:```pythonfeynman(&quot;Enzyme function annotation is a fundamental challenge, and numerous computational tools have been developed. However, most of these tools cannot accurately predict functional annotations, such as enzyme commission (EC) number, for less-studied proteins or those with previously uncharacterized functions or multiple activities. We present a machine learning algorithm named CLEAN (contrastive learningâ€“enabled enzyme annotation) to assign EC numbers to enzymes with better accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity compared with the state-of-the-art tool BLASTp. The contrastive learning framework empowers CLEAN to confidently (i) annotate understudied enzymes, (ii) correct mislabeled enzymes, and (iii) identify promiscuous enzymes with two or more EC numbersâ€”functions that we demonstrate by systematic in silico and in vitro experiments. We anticipate that this tool will be widely used for predicting the functions of uncharacterized enzymes, thereby advancing many fields, such as genomics, synthetic biology, and biocatalysis.&quot;)```### Chat BotTo experiment with a Chat Bot in the Jupyter notebook,we also provide the ChatBot interface.This interface automagically keeps track of chat historyfor as long as your Jupyter session is alive.Doing so allows you to use your own local Jupyter notebook as a chat interface.For example:```pythonfrom llamabot import ChatBotfeynman = ChatBot(&quot;You are Richard Feynman. You will be given a difficult concept, and your task is to explain it back.&quot;)feynman(&quot;Enzyme function annotation is a fundamental challenge, and numerous computational tools have been developed.

Pass in a list of paths to text files, or2. Pass in a pre-computed `GPTSimpleIndex` from LlamaIndex.As an illustrative example:```pythonfrom llamabot import QueryBotfrom pathlib import Pathblog_index = Path(&quot;/path/to/index.json&quot;)bot = QueryBot(system_message=&quot;You are a Q&amp;A bot.&quot;, saved_index_path=blog_index)result = bot(&quot;Do you have any adviceÂ for me on career development?&quot;, similarity_top_k=5)display(Markdown(result.response))```## CLI DemosLlamabot comes with CLI demos of what can be built with it and a bit of supporting code.Here is one where I expose a chatbot directly at the command line using `llamabot chat`:&lt;script async id=&quot;asciicast-594332&quot; src=&quot;https://asciinema.org/a/594332.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;And here is another one where `llamabot` is used as part of the backend of a CLI appto chat with one's Zotero library using `llamabot zotero chat`:&lt;script async id=&quot;asciicast-594326&quot; src=&quot;https://asciinema.org/a/594326.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;And finally, here is one where I use `llamabot`'s `SimpleBot` to create a botthat automatically writes commit messages for me.&lt;script async id=&quot;asciicast-594334&quot; src=&quot;https://asciinema.org/a/594334.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;## Contributing### New featuresNew features are welcome!These are early and exciting days for users of large language models.Our development goals are to keep the project as simple as possible.Features requests that come with a pull request will be prioritized;the simpler the implementation of a feature (in terms of maintenance burden),the more likely it will be approved.### Bug reportsPlease submit a bug report using the issue tracker.### Questions/DiscussionsPlease use the issue tracker on GitHub.## Contributors&lt;!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:START - Do not remove or modify this section --&gt;&lt;!-- prettier-ignore-start --&gt;&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable --&gt;&lt;table&gt;  &lt;tbody&gt;    &lt;tr&gt;      &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ericmjl.github.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2631566?v=4?s=100&quot; width=&quot;100px;&quot; alt=&quot;Eric Ma&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eric Ma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/modernatx/seqlike/commits?author=ericmjl&quot; title=&quot;Code&quot;&gt;ðŸ’»&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/modernatx/seqlike/commits?author=ericmjl&quot; title=&quot;Documentation&quot;&gt;ðŸ“–&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;/tr&gt;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;!-- markdownlint-restore --&gt;&lt;!-- prettier-ignore-end --&gt;&lt;!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END --&gt;</longdescription>
