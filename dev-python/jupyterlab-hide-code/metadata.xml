You may use`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.```bash# Clone the repo to your local environment# Move to jupyterlab-hide-code directory# Install dependenciesjlpm# Build Typescript sourcejlpm build# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLabjupyter labextension link .# Rebuild Typescript source after making changesjlpm build# Rebuild JupyterLab after making any changesjupyter lab build```You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab in watch mode to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension and application.```bash# Watch the source directory in another terminal tabjlpm watch# Run jupyterlab in watch mode in one terminal tabjupyter lab --watch```## AcknowlegementsWe acknowledge support from the EPFL Open Science Fund via the [OSSCAR](http://www.osscar.org) project.&lt;img src='https://www.osscar.org/_images/logos.png' width='700'&gt;</longdescription>
