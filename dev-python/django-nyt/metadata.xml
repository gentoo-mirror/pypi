Something happened&quot;), EVENT_KEY)All users subscribing to ``&quot;my_key&quot;`` will have a notification createdin their stack when ``notify()`` is called.If you have emails enabled, subscribers receive a summary of notifications atan interval of their choice.Data can be accessed easily from Django models or from the included JSONviews.Channels (django-channels)--------------------------Starting from django-nyt 1.0, support for the upcoming`channels &lt;https://channels.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_ has been added together withDjango 1.9 and 1.10 support.In order to install the prerelease, use an extra flag for pip:.. code:: bash    pip install django-nyt --preDocs----https://django-nyt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Why should you do this?-----------------------Users need a cleverly sifted stream of events that's highly customizableas well. By using django-nyt, your users can subscribe to global eventsor specific events pertaining specific objects.Instead of inventing your own notification system, use this and you won't haveto design your own models, and you will have a nice guide that goes throughthe various steps of implementing notifications for your project.Let's try to summarize the reasons you want to be using django-nyt: - Simple API: call ``notify()`` where-ever you want. - CLI for sending emails (as cron job, daemon or Celery task) - Support for django-channels and Web Sockets (optional, fallback for JSON-based polling) - Basic JavaScript / HTML example code - Multi-lingual - Individual subscription settings for each type of event, for instance:   - Event type A spawns instant email notifications, but Event B only gets emailed weekly. - Customizable intervals for which users can receive notifications - Optional URL for action target for each notification - Avoid clutter: Notifications don't get repeated, instead a counter is incremented.This project exists with ``django.contrib.messages`` in mind, to serve a simple,best-practice, scalable solution for notifications. There are loads of othernotification apps for Django, some focus on integration of specific communicationprotocolsWhat do you need to do?-----------------------django-nyt does everything it can to meet as many needs as possible andhave sane defaults.But you need to do a lot! Firstly, you need to write some JavaScript that willfetch the latest notifications and display them in some area of thescreen. Upon clicking that icon, the latest notifications are displayed, andclicking an individual notification will redirect the user through a pagethat marks the notification as read.Something like this:.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/django-wiki/django-nyt/master/docs/misc/screenshot_dropdown.png   :alt: Javascript drop-downJavaScript drop-down: Some examples are provided in the docs, but thereis no real easy way to place this nifty little thing at the top of yoursite, you're going to have to work it out on your own.Other items for your TODO list:-  Provide your users with options to customize their subscriptions and   notification preferences. Create your own ``Form`` inheriting from   ``django_nyt.forms.SettingsForm``.-  Customize contents of notification emails by overwriting templates in   ``django_nyt/emails/notification_email_message.txt`` and   ``django_nyt/emails/notification_email_subject.txt``.-  Make the mail notification daemon script run either constantly   ``python manage.py notifymail --daemon`` or with some interval by invoking   ``python manage.py notifymail --cron`` as a cronjob. You can also call it   from a Celery task or similar with ``call_command('notifymail', cron=True)``.Development / demo project--------------------------In your Git fork, run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` to install therequirements.Install pre-commit hooks to verify your commits::    pip install pre-commit    pre-commit installThe folder **test-project/** contains a pre-configured django project andan SQlite database. Login for django admin is *admin:admin*::    cd test-project    python manage.py runserverAfter this, navigate to `http://localhost:8000 &lt;http://localhost:8000&gt;`_Community---------Please visit #django-wiki on irc.freenode.net as many django-wiki usersare also familiar with django-nyt which previously lived insidedjango-wiki.</longdescription>
