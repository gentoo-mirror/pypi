It works with Python versions 3.x.`HERE &lt;https://www.here.com/&gt;`_ provides location based services. HERE exposes a `rest APIs &lt;https://developer.here.com/documentation&gt;`_ and this library is intended to make it even easier for Python programmers to use.Installing==========You can install herepy using Python Package Index::    $ pip install herepyInstall with conda from the Anaconda conda-forge channel::    $ conda install -c conda-forge herepyInstall from its source repository on GitHub::    $ pip install -e git+https://github.com/abdullahselek/HerePy#egg=herepyGetting the code================The code is hosted at https://github.com/abdullahselek/HerePyCheck out the latest development version anonymously with::    $ git clone git://github.com/abdullahselek/HerePy.git    $ cd HerePyTo install dependencies, run either::    $ pip install -r requirements.testing.txt    $ pip install -r requirements.txtTo install the minimal dependencies for production use (i.e., what is installedwith ``pip install herepy``) run::    $ pip install -r requirements.txtRunning Tests=============The test suite can be run against a single Python version which requires ``pip install pytest`` and optionally ``pip install pytest-cov`` (these are included if you have installed dependencies from ``requirements.testing.txt``)To run the unit tests with a single Python version::    $ py.test -vto also run code coverage::    $ py.test --cov=herepyTo run the unit tests against a set of Python versions::    $ toxModels======The library utilizes models to represent various data structures returned by **herepy**::    * herepy.GeocoderResponse    * herepy.GeocoderReverseResponse    * herepy.RoutingResponse    * herepy.RoutingResponseV8    * herepy.RoutingMatrixResponse    * herepy.GeocoderAutoCompleteResponse    * herepy.PlacesResponse    * herepy.PublicTransitResponse    * herepy.RmeResponse    * herepy.TrafficIncidentResponse    * herepy.DestinationWeatherResponse    * herepy.EVChargingStationsResponse    * herepy.WaypointSequenceResponse    * herepy.TrafficFlowResponse    * herepy.TrafficFlowAvailabilityResponse    * herepy.IsolineRoutingResponseAPI Clients===========Available API clients in **herepy**::    * herepy.DestinationWeatherApi    * herepy.EVChargingStationsApi    * herepy.FleetTelematicsApi    * herepy.GeocoderApi    * herepy.GeocoderAutoCompleteApi    * herepy.GeocoderReverseApi    * herepy.PlacesApi    * herepy.PublicTransitApi    * herepy.RmeApi    * herepy.RoutingApi    * herepy.TrafficApi    * herepy.IsolineRoutingApi    * herepy.MapTileApi    * herepy.VectorTileApi    * herepy.MapImageApiDocumentation=============View the latest herepy documentation at `https://herepy.abdullahselek.com/ &lt;https://herepy.abdullahselek.com/&gt;`_. You can view HERE's API documentation at: `https://developer.here.com/documentation &lt;https://developer.here.com/documentation&gt;`_.Using=====The library provides a Python wrapper around the HERE APIs with different data models. To get started, check out the examples in the ``examples/`` folder orread the documentation at `https://herepy.abdullahselek.com/ &lt;https://herepy.abdullahselek.com/&gt;`_. All API clients need an API key which you can get from `HERE Developer Portal &lt;https://developer.here.com/&gt;`_.License-------MIT LicenseCopyright (c) 2017 Abdullah SelekPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
