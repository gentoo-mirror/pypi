	<longdescription># Rasa Addons![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/rasa-addons.svg)![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/mrbot-ai/rasa-addons.svg)A set of ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ components to be used with Botfront and/or Rasa.[Botfront](https://github.com/botfront/botfront) is an open source chatbot platform built with Rasa.## rasa_addons.core.policies.BotfrontDisambiguationPolicyThis policy implements fallback and suggestion-based disambiguation.It works with actions ``rasa_addons.core.actions.ActionBotfrontDisambiguation``, ``rasa_addons.core.actions.ActionBotfrontDisambiguationFollowup`` and ``rasa_addons.core.actions.ActionBotfrontFallback``, and NLU pipeline component ``rasa_addons.nlu.components.intent_ranking_canonical_example_injector.IntentRankingCanonicalExampleInjector``.### Example usage```yamlpolicies:  ...  - name: rasa_addons.core.policies.BotfrontDisambiguationPolicy    fallback_trigger: 0.30 # default value    disambiguation_trigger: '$0 &lt; 2 * $1' # default value    disambiguation_template: 'utter_disambiguation' # default value    n_suggestions: 2 # default value    excluded_intents:      - ^chitchat\..* # default value      - ^basics\..*  ...```### Note: Automatic generation of suggestion button titlesBotfront introduces the notion of &quot;canonical&quot; training examples, which provide a canonical human-readable text for intent labels. For example, for an intent ``pay_bills`` with examples &quot;Pay bills&quot;, &quot;I want to pay my bills&quot;, &quot;How does one pay the bills on this website?&quot;, the first example may be selected as canonical. Canonical status serves as a cue to the bot designer, since intent labels can become untractable over time. It may also come to serve more Botfront-internal roles in the future.The Botfront Disambiguation Policy uses canonical status to provide localized text for the suggestion buttons shown to users during disambiguation. In order to enable this feature, the NLU pipeline for each language model needs to be extended in the following way:```yamlpipeline:  ...  - name: rasa_addons.nlu.components.intent_ranking_canonical_example_injector.IntentRankingCanonicalExampleInjector  ...```This NLU component enriches the ``intent_ranking`` key of user messages in the tracker with canonical text, so that the Disambiguation Policy may pick it up. If the NLU component is not used, buttons will have the intent name as their title.### Parameters##### fallback_triggerFloat (default ``0.30``): if confidence of top-ranking intent is below this threshold, fallback is triggered. Fallback is an action that utters the template ``utter_fallback`` and returns to the previous conversation state.##### disambiguation_triggerString (default ``'$0 &lt; 2 * $1'``): if this expression holds, disambiguation is triggered. (If it has already been triggered on the previous turn, fallback is triggered instead.) Here this expression resolves to &quot;the score of the top-ranking intent is below twice the score of the second-ranking intent&quot;. Disambiguation is an action that lets the user to choose from the top-ranking intents using a button prompt.##### disambiguation_templateString (default ``'utter_disambiguation'``): a response name resolving to a template containing a ``text`` field with a message, e.g. &quot;I could not quite understand. Did you mean...&quot;. Any button included under the ``buttons`` field of this template will also appear at the end of autogenerated suggestions, e.g. ``{&quot;title&quot;: &quot;None of the above&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;postback&quot;, &quot;payload&quot;: &quot;/deny_suggestions&quot;}``.##### n_suggestionsInt (default ``2``): the maximum number of suggestions to display (excluding the 'Other' options).##### excluded_intentsList (default ``[&quot;^chitchat\..*&quot;, &quot;^basics\..*&quot;]``): any intent (exactly) matching one of these regular expressions will not be shown as a suggestion.## rasa_addons.core.policies.BotfrontMappingPolicyThis policy implements regular expression-based direct mapping from intent to action.### Example usage```yamlpolicies:  ...  - name: rasa_addons.core.policies.BotfrontMappingPolicy    triggers:      - trigger: '^map\..+'        action: 'action_botfront_mapping'        extra_actions:          - 'action_myaction'  ...```### ActionBotfrontMappingThe default action ActionBotfrontMapping takes the intent that triggered the mapping policy, e.g. ``map.my_intent`` and tries to generate the template ``utter_map.my_intent``.## rasa_addons.core.channels.webchat.WebchatInput### Example usage```yamlcredentials:  ...  rasa_addons.core.channels.webchat.WebchatInput:    session_persistence: true    base_url: {{rasa_url}}    socket_path: '/socket.io/'  ...```## rasa_addons.core.channels.rest.BotfrontRestInputRest Input Channel with multilanguage and metadata support.### Example usage```yamlcredentials:  ...  rasa_addons.core.channels.rest.BotfrontRestInput:    # POST {{rasa_url}}/webhooks/rest/webhook/  ...```## rasa_addons.core.nlg.BotfrontTemplatedNaturalLanguageGeneratorIdential to Rasa's `TemplatedNaturalLanguageGenerator`, except in handles templates with a language key.## rasa_addons.core.nlg.GraphQLNaturalLanguageGeneratorThe new standard way to connect to the Botfront NLG endpoint. Note that support for the legacy REST endpoint is maintained for the moment. This feature is accessed by supplying a URL that doesn't contain the substring &quot;graphql&quot;.### Example usage```yamlendpoints:  ...  nlg:    url: 'http://localhost:3000/graphql'    type: 'rasa_addons.core.nlg.GraphQLNaturalLanguageGenerator'  ...```</longdescription>
