	<longdescription># Qiskit Nature[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Qiskit/qiskit-nature.svg?style=popout-square)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)**Qiskit Nature** is an open-source framework which supports solving quantum mechanical naturalscience problems using quantum computing algorithms. This includes finding ground and excitedstates of electronic and vibrational structure problems, measuring the dipole moments of molecularsystems, solving the Ising and Fermi-Hubbard models on lattices, and much more.![Qiskit Nature Design](./docs/images/overview.png)The code comprises various modules revolving around:- data loading from chemistry drivers or file formats- second-quantized operator construction and manipulation- translating from the second-quantized to the qubit space- a quantum circuit library of natural science targeted ansatze- natural science specific algorithms and utilities to make the use of Qiskit  Terra's algorithms easier- and much more## InstallationWe encourage installing Qiskit Nature via the pip tool (a python package manager).```bashpip install qiskit-nature```**pip** will handle all dependencies automatically and you will always install the latest(and well-tested) version.If you want to work on the very latest work-in-progress versions, either to try features ahead oftheir official release or if you want to contribute to Qiskit Nature, then you can install from source.To do this follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/getting_started.html#installation).### Optional InstallsTo run chemistry experiments using Qiskit Nature, it is recommended that you installa classical computation chemistry software program/library interfaced by Qiskit.Several, as listed below, are supported, and while logic to interface these programs is supplied byQiskit Nature via the above pip installation, the dependent programs/libraries themselves needto be installed separately.- [Gaussian 16&amp;trade;](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/apidocs/qiskit_nature.second_q.drivers.gaussiand.html), a commercial chemistry program- [PSI4](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/apidocs/qiskit_nature.second_q.drivers.psi4d.html), a chemistry program that exposes a Python interface allowing for accessing internal objects- [PySCF](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/apidocs/qiskit_nature.second_q.drivers.pyscfd.html), an open-source Python chemistry programAdditionally, you may find the following optional dependencies useful:- [sparse](https://github.com/pydata/sparse/), a library for sparse multi-dimensional arrays. When installed, Qiskit Nature can leverage this to reduce the memory requirements of your calculations.- [opt_einsum](https://github.com/dgasmith/opt_einsum), a tensor contraction order optimizer for `np.einsum`.## Creating Your First Chemistry Programming Experiment in QiskitCheck our [getting started page](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/getting_started.html)for a first example on how to use Qiskit Nature.### Further examplesLearning path notebooks may be found in the[Nature Tutorials](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/tutorials/index.html) sectionof the documentation and are a great place to start.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------## Contribution GuidelinesIf you'd like to contribute to Qiskit, please take a look at our[contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).This project adheres to Qiskit's [code of conduct](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/issues) for tracking requests and bugs.
