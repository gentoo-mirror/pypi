	<longdescription># Versatile Data Kit Control CLIVDK Control CLI is meant for Data Engineers to use to manage the lifecycle of jobs - create, delete, deploy, configure Data Jobs.To build or contribute, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).## InstallationInstall VDK Control CLI with:```bashpip install vdk-control-cli```This will install console application called `vdkcli`Then run help to see what it can do:```bashvdkcli --help````vdkcli` is the name of the console application only when vdk-control-cli is installed autonomously. Typically,it is a dependency of Versatile Data Kit and the console application is `vdk` (hence, all commands in error and helpmessages in this project refer to `vdk`). Keep in mind that if you are using this project autonomously, you shoulduse `vdkcli` command instead of `vdk`.### Environment variables:* VDK_BASE_CONFIG_FOLDER -  Override local base configuration folder (by default in $HOME folder). Inside it will create folder .vdk.internal.  CLI state may be kept there (login info). Use in case multiple users need to login (e.g in case of automation) on same machine.* VDK_CONTROL_SERVICE_REST_API_URL - Default Control Service URL to use if not specified as command line argument* VDK_API_TOKEN - Default API Token to use if another authentication has not been used with vdk login* VDK_API_TOKEN_AUTHORIZATION_URL - Default API token URL to use if another authentication has not been used with vdk login.### SecurityIf Control Service configured require authentication: vdk login must have finished successfully.Or alternatively correct VDK_API_TOKEN_AUTHORIZATION_URL and VDK_API_TOKEN must be set correctly and will behave same as `vdk login -t api-token`.If vdk login is used - it take priority over environment variables set VDK_API_TOKEN_AUTHORIZATION_URL and VDK_API_TOKENTo clear previous login info (aka logout) use `vdk logout`.In case of credentials type vdk login flow we start a process on port `31113` to receive the credentials.If you already have process running on `31113` you can override the value.To override the port set environmental variable `OAUTH_PORT` with free port which the client can use.## Plugins### Installing and Using pluginsInstalling a third party plugin can be easily done with pip:```bashpip install vdk-control-cli-NAMEpip uninstall vdk-control-cli-NAME```If a plugin is installed, vdk automatically finds and integrates it.### Write your own pluginA plugin is python module that enhances or changes the behaviour of the vdk cli. &lt;br&gt;A plugin contains one or multiple hook functions.See all supported hook function specifications that can be implemented in [specs.py](src/vdk/api/control/plugin/specs.py)In order to create a new plugin there are only 2 steps:&lt;br&gt;* Create your implementation of the plugin's hook(s):```python# define hookimpl as follows (library requirement: pluggy)hookimpl = pluggy.HookimplMarker(&quot;vdk_control_cli.plugin&quot;)# though it's better to use `vdk.internal.control.plugin.markers.hookimpl` from vdk-control-cli python package# name of function must match name of hookspec function@hookimpldef get_default_commands_options():    # your implementation here ; for example to set defaults for `vdk login --type --oauth2-authorization-url` command    default_options = {        &quot;login&quot;: {            &quot;auth_type&quot;: &quot;api-token&quot;, # note values must be valid or the plugin may break the CLI, no checking is done at this point            &quot;api_token_authorization_url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost/authorize&quot; # replace dashes with underscore for the argument name        }    }    return default_options```* Register as plugin by listing the plugin modules in vdk_control_cli.plugin entry_point in your setup.py:```python    entry_points={ 'vdk_control_cli.plugin': ['name_of_plugin = myproject.pluginmodule'] }```&lt;br&gt;The plugin system is based on [pluggy.](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#implementations)&lt;br&gt;SDK Extensibility design can be seen [here](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/tree/main/specs)## AuthenticationIn order to use credentials login type you need to create OAuth2 Application.</longdescription>
