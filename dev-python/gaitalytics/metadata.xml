Prior to utilizing the features of gaitalytics,it is necessary to perform data labeling, modeling, and filtering procedures.The library's versatility allows it to be adaptable to various marker sets and modeling algorithms,offering high configurability.&gt; **Note**&gt; Current pre-release is only tested with data acquired with Motek Caren, HBM2 Lower Body Trunk and PIG. ## Functionalities### Event Detection| Method     | Description      | options                                                                                                                                                                                                  ||:-----------|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| Marker     | Zenis 2006       | min_distance = 100: minimum of frames between same event on same context&lt;br/&gt;foot_strike_offset = 0: Amount of frames to offset foot strike&lt;br/&gt;foot_off_offset = 0: Amount of frames to offset foot off | | ForcePlate | Split ForcePlate | -

To install follow theinstructions [here](https://biomechanical-toolkit.github.io/docs/Wrapping/Python/_build_instructions.html) or useconda-forgeversion [here](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/btk)Fast install with anaconda:````shellpip install gaitalyticsconda install -c conda-forge btk````### ConfigurationGaitalytics can be used with any marker set, which at least includes four hip markers (left front/back, rightfront/back)and four foot markers (left heel/toe, right heel/toe) and four ankle makers (left medial/lateral, right medial lateral).All functionalities in the libraries only take points into account which are configured in as specific yaml file. Working example file can be found [here](https://github.com/cereneo-foundation/gaitalytics/blob/94bbc73072535d7f1e53ea935b6145194b137f09/settings/hbm_pig.yaml)Minimal requirements would look like this:````yamlmarker_set_mapping:  left_back_hip: LASIS  right_back_hip: RASIS  left_front_hip: LPSIS  right_front_hip: RPSIS    left_lat_malleoli: LLM  right_lat_malleoli: RLM  left_med_malleoli: LMM  right_med_malleoli: RMM  right_heel: RHEE  left_heel: LHEE  right_meta_2: RMT2  left_meta_2: LMT2    com: COM  left_cmos: cmos_left  right_cmos: cmos_right  model_mapping:````&gt; **Warning**&gt; Do not rename keys of the minimal setting### PipelinePlease take the resources inthe [example folder](https://github.com/cereneo-foundation/gaitalytics/tree/94bbc73072535d7f1e53ea935b6145194b137f09/examples)for advice.###</longdescription>
