	<longdescription># foxgloveFoxglove is a Firefox wrapper with two purposes:1. Programatically generate Firefox profiles with preferences that I consider   desirable for the majority of use cases. These disable, where possible,   Firefox's built-in advertising, pop-ups, telemetry, experiments, and similar   features. Generated profiles are stored in `~/.foxglove`.2. Optionally ssh to a remote host and configure the Firefox profile to use   that connection as a SOCKS proxy.```usage: foxglove [-h] [--chrome path] [--content path] [-d] [-e] [-a add-on] profile [host]foxglove - a Firefox profile and proxy managerpositional arguments:  profile         the name of the foxglove-managed profile to use or create  host            ssh server hostname. If this option is given, foxglove will attempt to use ssh(1) to connect to the host and configure Firefox to use it                  as a SOCKS proxyoptional arguments:  -h, --help      show this help message and exit  --chrome path   path to a userChrome.css file to add to the profile  --content path  path to a userContent.css file to add to the profile  -d              dry run (don't launch Firefox)  -e              ephemeral (delete profile on exit)  -a add-on       download and install this add-on. Use the name as it appears in the Mozilla add-ons site URL. May be used multiple times```To use the &quot;host&quot; argument, configure a corresponding Host entry in your`~/.ssh/config` such that you can ssh to it with no additional arguments. Theremote host must allow port forwarding.Foxglove launches Firefox via a subprocess call to &quot;firefox&quot;. On MacOS, theFirefox binary is not typically in PATH, so foxglove first appends`/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS` to PATH. Prepending anotherdirectory to PATH may be used to select a particular Firefox installation. Forexample, you might launch Firefox Nightly on MacOS like this:```bashPATH=&quot;/Applications/Firefox Nightly.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH&quot; foxglove example```## PreferencesThese settings have changed substantially during Firefox's development, so somemay be unsupported or meaningless in current versions.Preference changes made to a foxglove-managed profile will reset to foxglove'sdefault values on the next run. To retain changes, you can either use thegenerated profile as a normal Firefox profile without foxglove, or modify yourinstallation of foxglove's prefs.js file with your desired preferences.Some foxglove defaults to consider changing:| Key                               | Default | Foxglove | Comments                                       || --------------------------------- | ------- | -------- | -----------------------------------------------|| dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled | true    | false    | May break some sites                           || privacy.resistFingerprinting      | false   | false    | May break some sites; can be counterproductive || privacy.donottrackheader.enabled  | false   | true     | May be used for fingerprinting                 || network.trr.mode                  | 0       | 0        | TRRs can interfere with test environments      |## Related projects- [Firefox Profilemaker](https://github.com/allo-/firefox-profilemaker)</longdescription>
