Chaunzwa, Simon Bernatz, Ahmed Hosny, Raymond H Mak, Nicolai J Birkbak, Hugo JWL Aerts---**NOTE** For detailed documentation check our [website](https://aim-harvard.github.io/foundation-cancer-image-biomarker/) ---&amp;emsp;## Overview&lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; justify-content: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;docs/assets/images/overview_v5.png&quot; width=800 /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;A foundation model, based on a deep convolutional encoder architecture, was pre-trained by contrasting volumes with and without lesions (see &lt;b&gt;a.&lt;/b&gt; in Figure). The foundation model was then used to extract biomarkers and evaluated for three classification tasks on diverse datasets. (see &lt;b&gt;b.&lt;/b&gt;). We adapted foundation model to specific use cases by extracting features or through fine-tuning (see &lt;b&gt;c.&lt;/b&gt;). Performance of the foundation models was compared against conventional supervised implementations, trained from scratch (left) and fine-tuned from a different task (right) (in &lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;). The comparison was made through several criteria for different use cases, including quantitative performance, stability, and biological analysis. Biological, clinical, and stability analyses are limited to use case 2 due to the availability of associated data.  &amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;## Quick Start (in under 15 mins!)We provide two notebooks that can be run in google colab to promote the use of our model by the community,1. A reproducibility notebook that allows users to recreate our analysis for NSCLC prognostication, from downloading the data to obtaining results matching our manuscript. &lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;[![](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Svk8VaZHWAYdZHE45DNdWXVqhe7v9sFR?usp=sharing) &lt;/center&gt;2. A bring your own use case notebook that shows you how you can use the foundation model for your data. &lt;br&gt; &lt;center&gt;[![](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JMtj_4W0uNPzrVnM9EpN1_xpaB-5KC1H?usp=sharing) &lt;/center&gt;&lt;b&gt;You are not limited to using Colab and you can run our model on your data locally in only 3 steps!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Step 1:&lt;/u&gt; Install all our dependencies:```bashpip install foundation-cancer-image-biomarker --pre```&lt;u&gt;Step 2:&lt;/u&gt;  Generate a CSV file with the path to your images and seed points (in physical coordinates),| **image_path**               | **coordX** | **coordY** | **coordZ** ||------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|| /content/data/dummy_0.nii.gz | 55.0       | 119.0      | 27.0       |&lt;u&gt;Step 3:&lt;/u&gt;  Run this in your code environment,```pythonfrom fmcib.run import get_featuresfeature_df = get_features(&quot;csv_path_here&quot;)```This will preprocess your data, download our pre-trained model and execute inference on whatever device you have (CPU/GPU) and return a dataframe with the features. &amp;emsp;## LicenseThis project is licensed under the terms of the `MIT` license.
