VOLTTRON historian agents can be created by subclassing the [BaseHistorian class](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-lib-base-historian/blob/develop/src/historian/base/base_historian.py) in this library.## Requirements - Python &gt;= 3.10## InstallationThis library can be installed using ```pip install volttron-lib-base-historian```. However, this is not necessary. Any historian agent that uses this library will automatically install it as part of its installation. For example, installing [SQLiteHistorian](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-sqlitehistorian) will automatically install volttron-lib-base-historian into the same python environment## DevelopmentPlease see the following for contributing guidelines [contributing](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-core/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).Please see the following helpful guide about [developing modular VOLTTRON agents](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-core/blob/develop/DEVELOPING_ON_MODULAR.md)# Disclaimer NoticeThis material was prepared as an account of work sponsored by an agency of theUnited States Government.
