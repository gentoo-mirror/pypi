	<longdescription>============== CSS Minifier==============RCSSmin is a CSS minifier.The minifier is based on the semantics of the `YUI compressor`_\, which itselfis based on `the rule list by Isaac Schlueter`_\.This module is a re-implementation aiming for speed instead of maximumcompression, so it can be used at runtime (rather than during a preprocessingstep). RCSSmin does syntactical compression only (removing spaces, commentsand possibly semicolons). It does not provide semantic compression (likeremoving empty blocks, collapsing redundant properties etc). It does, however,support various CSS hacks (by keeping them working as intended).Here's a feature list:- Strings are kept, except that escaped newlines are stripped- Space/Comments before the very end or before various characters are  stripped: ``:{});=&gt;],!`` (The colon (``:``) is a special case, a single  space is kept if it's outside a ruleset.)- Space/Comments at the very beginning or after various characters are  stripped: ``{}(=:&gt;[,!``- Optional space after unicode escapes is kept, resp. replaced by a simple  space- whitespaces inside ``url()`` definitions are stripped, except if it's a  quoted non-base64 data url- Comments starting with an exclamation mark (``!``) can be kept optionally.- All other comments and/or whitespace characters are replaced by a single  space.- Multiple consecutive semicolons are reduced to one- The last semicolon within a ruleset is stripped- CSS Hacks supported:  - IE7 hack (``&gt;/**/``)  - Mac-IE5 hack (``/*\*/.../**/``)  - The boxmodelhack is supported naturally because it relies on valid CSS2    strings  - Between ``:first-line`` and the following comma or curly brace a space is    inserted. (apparently it's needed for IE6)  - Same for ``:first-letter``rcssmin.c is a reimplementation of rcssmin.py in C and improves runtime up tofactor 100 or so (depending on the input). docs/BENCHMARKS in the sourcedistribution contains the details.Supported python versions are 2.7 and 3.6+... _YUI compressor: https://github.com/yui/yuicompressor/.. _the rule list by Isaac Schlueter: https://github.com/isaacs/cssmin/Copyright and License~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Copyright 2011 - 2023André Malo or his licensors, as applicable.The whole package (except for the files in the bench/ directory) isdistributed under the Apache License Version 2.0.
