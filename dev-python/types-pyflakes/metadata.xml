	<longdescription>## Typing stubs for pyflakesThis is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)type stub package for the [`pyflakes`](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes) package.It can be used by type-checking tools like[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses`pyflakes`.This version of `types-pyflakes` aims to provide accurate annotationsfor `pyflakes==3.1.*`.The source for this package can be found athttps://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pyflakes. All fixes fortypes and metadata should be contributed there.This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.This package was generated from typeshed commit `81633e27097228a8a7eb0f963c62916ecea78abc` and was testedwith mypy 1.7.1, pyright 1.1.334, andpytype 2023.11.21.</longdescription>
