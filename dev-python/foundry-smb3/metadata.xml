We seek to streamline the game development processes to ensure that the nostalgic memories of [Power Glove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Glove), [Nintendo Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Power), and goomba stomping can be accessed and modified by all.  We want to put the power into our favorite game and you the super player!Installation------------To install and use Foundry, there are three options:1. [Download Foundry Executable](https://github.com/TheJoeSmo/Foundry/releases)        This is the every-person method.  Every minor and major release will prepackage the editor into an executable to run painlessly on your native machine.  To get started, go to [Releases](https://github.com/TheJoeSmo/Foundry/releases) and download the executable specific to your operating system.2. [Download Foundry from PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/foundry-smb3/)        This is the method recommended if you wish to run the project natively with Python.  This may required if you use a 32 bit machine or an obscure operating system.  It is also required if you wish to use Foundry in some combination with other Python packages.  With [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, write `pip install foundry-smb3` into your console and run `foundry` or run `foundry.main.start` from inside Python.3. [Download Foundry from Github](https://github.com/TheJoeSmo/Foundry.git)    This is the developer method.  This will provide you easy access to the entire repository.  In addition to [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) you will need [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) installed.  Once installed run the following commands into your terminal:    ```    $ git clone git@github.com:TheJoeSmo/Foundry.git    $ cd Foundry    $ poetry install    ```Documentation-------------All documentation of the editor can be found at [Foundry Documentation](https://thejoesmo.github.io/Foundry/).Call for Contributions----------------------Foundry is a community driven initiative that relies on your help and expertise.Small improvements or fixes are critical to this repository's success.
