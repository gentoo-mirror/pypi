	<longdescription># Interpreter CommandAn overcomplicated solution to the question &quot;How could we easily make multiple autonomous routines?&quot;The interpreter command provides a way to create a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that can run any sequence of commands at runtime. Ostensibly, this to write a command sequence for autonomous execution; however, this can be used to create a command sequence for any purpose (whether the hit to efficiency is worth it is up to the user).## Installation#### PythonWindows:```batchpy -3 install interpreter-command```MacOS/Linux:```bashpython3 install interpreter-command```#### C++/Java:TBD when I've written the things## UsageAll you need to do to create an InterpretCommand is to instantiate theclass in your language of choice, register commands to it, and register your fully-realized InterpretCommand object the same way youwould register any other command. At any time, you can load a new program and replace the current one.#### Python```python# WARNING: This example will not work as-isimport wpilibimport interpretercommand as icimport commands2class MyRobot(wpilib.TimedRobot):    # ...     def robotInit(self):        # Creating the interpreter        self.interpreter = ic.InterpretCommand()        # Registering the commands        self.interpreter.register(&quot;say&quot;, commands2.PrintCommand)        self.interpreter.register(&quot;drive&quot;, SomeDriveCommand, drive_subsystem) # parameters: x, y, z            # ...    def autonomousInit(self):        self.interpreter.schedule()    def teleopInit(self):        self.interpreter.cancel()```Now you could write a program like```say &quot;hello&quot;say &quot;world&quot;drive 0, 0.4, 0```which would print &quot;hello\nworld&quot;, then drive the robot in the Y direction at 40% speed until the command is canceled, assuming`SomeDriveCommand` does nothing but drive continuously using itsinputs.## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.

The concept may work well with other robotics frameworks, but this library is not compatible.</longdescription>
