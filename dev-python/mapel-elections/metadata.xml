	<longdescription># Mapel-electionsThis pacakge is a plugin for [mapel](https://pypi.org/project/mapel/) extendingit with capabilities of drawing maps of various elections intances.For the most recent version of mapel, visit its [gitrepo](https://pypi.org/project/mapel/).# InstallationFor a simple installation, type:`pip install mapel-elections`in the console.For more complicated variants of installation, refer to the readme of mapel[here](https://github.com/szufix/mapel).## Extra dependenciesFor the full functionality of the package, it is recommended to also installextra dependencies. Doing this is covered in [thisreadme](https://pypi.org/project/mapel/). The extra dependencies contain:  ```cplex&gt;=20.1.0.1pulp~=2.5.1abcvoting~=2.0.0b0permanent```  which unlock approval based committee rules (which require solving I(L)Pprograms) and sampling a matrix using a permanent-based approach.One can do it by invoking  `pip install mapel-elections[extras]`&gt; :exclamation: Note that this library contains C++ extensions. So installing  this library from sources  might be a bit cumbersome. We will, one day, put  here an instruction how to do it.## Testing InstallationIf the instalation was successfull, you should be able to mimic the following:  ```(&lt;virtual_envirnonment_name&gt;) $ python...&gt;&gt;&gt; import mapel.elections.metrics.cppdistances as d...&gt;&gt;&gt; d.swapd([[0,1,2],[0,1,2]], [[0,1,2],[2,1,0]])3&gt;&gt;&gt; exit()```# AcknowledgmentsThis project is part of the [PRAGMA project](https://home.agh.edu.pl/~pragma/)which has received funding from the [European Research Council(ERC)](https://home.agh.edu.pl/~pragma/) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020research and innovation programme ([grant agreement No101002854](https://erc.easme-web.eu/?p=101002854)).</longdescription>
