	<longdescription>pytest-pythonpath=================**NOTE:**  This plugin is obsolete as of pytest 7.0.0.  Thanks to [this PR](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/9134) from [Brian Okken](https://github.com/okken), you can now modify the PYTHONPATH using the `pythonpath` configuration option.  See documentation here: https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/reference/reference.html#confval-pythonpathThis is a py.test plugin for adding to the PYTHONPATH from the pytests.ini file before tests run.Installation------------Install with pip::    pip install pytest-pythonpathUninstall with pip::    pip uninstall pytest-pythonpathUsage-----Add a line in your pytest.ini file with a key of `python_paths` and provide a space seperated list of pathsyou want inserted to the beginning of the PYTHONPATH before any tests run:    [pytest]    python_paths = your/path/apps your/path/libsIf you'd like to have `.pth` files be processed too, use `site_dirs` instead:    [pytest]    site_dirs = your/path/apps your/path/libsThis will cause the `addsitedir` function to be called on each path instead of a simple `sys.path.insert(0, path)`.Note that using the `site_dirs` will not place your specified paths in front of existing paths.Once this is added to your pytest.ini, you can use the py.test command as you normally would.</longdescription>
