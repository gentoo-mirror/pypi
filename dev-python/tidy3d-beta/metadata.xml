While it's currently a waitlist for new users, we will be rolling out to many more users in the coming weeks!  See [this page](https://flexcompute-tidy3ddocumentation.readthedocs-hosted.com/quickstart.html) in our documentation for more details.### Installing the front end #### Using pip (recommended)The easiest way to install tidy3d is through [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).```pip install tidy3d```This will install the latest stable version, to get the a &quot;pre-release&quot; version.```pip install --pre tidy3d```And to get a specific version `x.y.z````pip install tidy3d==x.y.z```### Installing on WindowsPre-release `1.9.0rc1` introduces the `adjoint` plugin, which uses [jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for automatic differentiation of tidy3d simulations. As windows users may have trouble installing `jax`, the recommended approach is to use [jax-windows-builder](https://github.com/cloudhan/jax-windows-builder) to first install jaxlib before tidy3d.```pip install &quot;jax[cpu]===0.3.14&quot; -f https://whls.blob.core.windows.net/unstable/index.html --use-deprecated legacy-resolverpip install tidy3d```More details can be found [here](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer.html#additional-notes-for-building-jaxlib-from-source-on-windows).### Installing from sourceFor development purposes, and to get the latest development versions, you can download and install the package from source as:```git clone https://github.com/flexcompute/tidy3d.gitcd tidy3dpip install -e .```### Configuring and authenticationAuthentication (linking the front end to your account) will be done via an API key moving forward.You can find your API key in the [web interface](ehttp://tidy3d.simulation.cloud)After signing in and navigating to the account page by clicking the &quot;user&quot; icon on the left-hand side, copy the API key from the button on the right-hand side of the page.To set up the API key to work with Tidy3D, we need to store it either in the `~/.tidy3d/config` file or an environment variable.You can set it up using one of three following options.#### Command line (recommended)``tidy3d configure`` and then enter your API key when prompted.Note that Windows users must run the following instead (ideally in an anaconda prompt):```pip install pipxpipx run tidy3d configure```#### ManuallyFor an API key of `{your_api_key}`, you may run``echo 'apikey = &quot;{your_api_key}&quot;' &gt; ~/.tidy3d/config``or manually insert the line `'apikey = &quot;{your_api_key}&quot;` in the `~/.tidy3d/config` file.#### Environment VariableSet the `SIMCLOUD_APIKEY` environment variable to your API key (in quotes).``export SIMCLOUD_APIKEY=&quot;{your_api_key}&quot;``### Testing the installation and authentication#### Front end packageYou can verify the front end installation worked by running:```python -c &quot;import tidy3d as td; print(td.__version__)&quot;```and it should print out the version number, for example:```1.0.0```#### AuthenticationTo test the web / authentication```python -c &quot;import tidy3d.web&quot;```## Issues / Feedback / Bug ReportingYour feedback helps us immensely!If you find bugs, file an [Issue](https://github.com/flexcompute/tidy3d/issues).For more general discussions, questions, comments, anything else, open a topic in the [Discussions Tab](https://github.com/flexcompute/tidy3d/discussions).## License[GNU LGPL](https://github.com/flexcompute/tidy3d/blob/main/LICENSE)</longdescription>
