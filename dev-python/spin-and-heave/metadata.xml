	<longdescription># spin-and-heave  Spin &amp;amp; Heave uses the lambdaci docker image to package and zip a lambda package.If you do not already have the docker image, docker will attempt to download it.After this is done, S&amp;amp;H will run `terraform apply` (can be skipped with a flag).  With null resources, etags, triggers,and source code hashes, it almost feels like you could use terraform as an end-to-end deploymenttool for lambda.  You could make a change to your function code, and when you ranapply terraform would spot the change in the hash or etag, and everything (includingyour infrastructure) would update accordingly. To it's credit, you can almost get itworking with just pure terraform. But as my friend Gus said, &quot;when you first get ahammer everything looks like a nail.&quot; and Terraform isn't an all powerful hammer fordeployment and everything. For example, it shouldn't be used to create buildartifacts, as *apparentlymart* makes clear in several git issues.  Spin &amp;amp; Heave is one solution (of many). Instead of running `terraform apply` and using null resources to build and zip, I use S&amp;amp;H, which leverages docker to build and zip everything, then apply changes in terraform. My terraform code simply refers to the zip S&amp;amp;H created. If the zip has changed terraform will upload a new zip to either lambda, or s3, and then redeploy the lambda function.   ### flags  ```positional arguments:  source                the directory with your lambda code in it                        $ spin-and-heave lambda                        where `lambda` is the dir including the python lambda code and requirements                        for more information: https://gitlab.com/shindagger/spin-and-heaveoptional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -r RUNTIME, --runtime RUNTIME                        optional. define a runtime.                        defaults:                        python: `python3.6`                        nodejs: `nodejs10.x` with the --node [-js] flag  -bc BUILD, --build BUILD                        optional. define a build command.                        defaults:                        python: `pip install --progress-bar off -r requirements.txt -t .`                        nodejs: `npm install --production` with the --node [-js] flag  -x EXCLUDE, --exclude EXCLUDE                        optional. exclude files and directories from the zip file.                        uses zip command -x flag conventions.                        example: `spin-and-heave lambda -x file.jpg -x docker/\*`  -js, --node           deploy node.  -s, --skip            skip terraform apply.  -i, --init            init terraform before running apply.  -a, --approve         run terraform apply with `auto-approve` flag  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit```### usage  `$ spin-and-heave -h`  *show spin-and-heave help page.*   `$ spin-and-heave lambda_project`  *where &quot;lambda_project&quot; is the directory with your python lambda files.this will run the lambdaci docker image for the runtime python3.6then save the zip file (in this case &quot;lambda_project.zip&quot;) in your currentworking directory*  `$ spin-and-heave lambda_project -s`  *skip terraform apply*  `$ spin-and-heave lambda_project -ai`  *run terraform init before applying \[-i\], also run terraform apply with -auto-approve flag \[-a\]  useful for CI/CD*   `$ spin-and-heave lambda_project -js`  *spin and heave a node lambda package, defaults to nodejs10.xthis will run &quot;npm install --production&quot; instead of &quot;pip install&quot;*  `$ spin-and-heave lambda_project -r python3.7`  *alternatively, use custom runtimes. The runtime you pick will use the lambdaci docker image with that runtime as a tag  NOTE: at this point any runtime besides node and python also require a build command.*  `$ spin-and-heave lambda_project -r ruby2.5 -bc &quot;bundle install --deployment&quot;`  *an example using ruby, which includes a build command.   NOTE: at this point any runtime besides node and python also require a build command.*   `$ spin-and-heave lambda_project -js -x file.jpg -x docker/\*`  *spin and heave a node lambda package, excluding file.jpg and a directory called docker from the zip*  for an example terraform/lambda setup to play with see:  https://gitlab.com/shindagger/spin-and-heave/tree/master/example  ### installation  `$ pip install spin-and-heave`  ### example    ![Usage Screep Cap][screencap][screencap]: https://believe-it-or-not-im-walking-on-air.s3.amazonaws.com/sah_screen_cap.jpg &quot;Usage Screen Cap&quot;</longdescription>
