	<longdescription>CancellationToken for Python---This library provide simple cancellation token. # UsageFirst create token```pythonfrom cancel_token import CancellationTokentoken = CancellationToken()```At any point in time you can check if token has been cancelled:```pythonif token.cancelled:    print('Operation already cancelled')    return None  ```To cancel token call its `cancel` method:```pythontoken.cancel()assert token.cancelled```It is also possible to add callbacks that will be called on when token is cancelled:```pythondef handler():    print('Operation has been cancelled')token.on_cancel(handler)```**Note**:* If token is already cancelled, callback will be invoked immediately.* All registered callbacks will be called sequentially during `cancel` call.* Callback throwing exception will prevent remaining callbacks from calling. However token will be cancelled* During callback invocation token is already cancelled* It is possible to add callback from within callback* Removing callback from within callback **will not** prevent its execution</longdescription>
