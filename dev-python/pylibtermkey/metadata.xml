[Other Python bindings](https://github.com/temoto/ctypes_libtermkey) are out of date and not easily installable. This project has a few differences:* libtermkey is automatically built as part of this project* pybind11 is used for easy binding * unit tests are included * precompiled wheels are built from this repo and available on PyPI### InstallationTo install from PyPI:```pip install pylibtermkey```### ExampleA minimal example of obtaining a keystroke and printing the results:```import pylibtermkey_cpp as termkeytk = termkey.TermKey()res, key = tk.waitkey()print(res)print(tk.strfkey(key, termkey.TermKeyFormat.VIM)```Note that, by default, termkey will read from stdin causing python terminal to not display typed characters. It is best to use termkey in an pre-written script rather in a REPL setup (as you will not be able to see what you are typing once termkey is active).For other features, see the [tests](https://github.com/mvilim/pylibtermkey/blob/master/python/pylibtermkey/test_pylibtermkey.py) or the [libtermkey man pages](http://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libtermkey/doc/).### BuildingTo build this project:Building from source requires cmake (`pip install cmake`).```python setup.py```### Unit testsTo run the unit tests:```python setup.py test```or use nose:```nosetests python/pylibtermkey```### LicensingThis project is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/mvilim/pylibtermkey/blob/master/LICENSE). It uses the [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/) and [libtermkey](http://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libtermkey/) projects whose licenses can be found in those [projects' directories](https://github.com/mvilim/pylibtermkey/blob/master/cpp/thirdparty).</longdescription>
