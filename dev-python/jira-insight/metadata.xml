	<longdescription># API client for Jira InsightThis is a API client to access data in the Jira app [Insight](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1212137/insight-asset-management).## Usage```pythonfrom jira_insight import *# Initialize the main Insight object with the URL and credentials for Basic Authinsight = Insight(&quot;https://jira.example.com&quot;, (&quot;USERNAME&quot;, &quot;PASSWORD&quot;))# Get a specific object schema by IDobject_schema = InsightObjectSchema(insight, 1)# Search for objects by IQLobjects = object_schema.search_iql(&quot;SerialNumber = DEADBEEF&quot;)```## Caveats* First and foremost: This is alpha software. I use it for a specific use case,but for everything else, there be dragons.* This is probably very slow with complex object schemas, as many things areloaded preemptively when the Insight object is first instanciated.* You can not yet edit objects after they have been created.</longdescription>
