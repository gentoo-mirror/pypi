They are automatically injected by name.-  **Command-line interface**: You get a powerful command-line interface for each   experiment that you can use to change parameters and run different variants.-  **Observers**: Sacred provides Observers that log all kinds of information   about your experiment, its dependencies, the configuration you used,   the machine it is run on, and of course the result. These can be saved   to a MongoDB, for easy access later.-  **Automatic seeding** helps controlling the randomness in your experiments,   such that the results remain reproducible.Example-------+------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+| **Script to train an SVM on the iris dataset** | **The same script as a Sacred experiment** |+------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+| .. code:: python                               | .. code:: python                           ||                                                |                                            ||  from numpy.random import permutation          |   from numpy.random import permutation     ||  from sklearn import svm, datasets             |   from sklearn import svm, datasets        ||                                                |   from sacred import Experiment            ||                                                |   ex = Experiment('iris_rbf_svm')          ||                                                |                                            ||                                                |   @ex.config                               ||                                                |   def cfg():                               ||  C = 1.0                                       |     C = 1.0                                ||  gamma = 0.7                                   |     gamma = 0.7                            ||                                                |                                            ||                                                |   @ex.automain                             ||                                                |   def run(C, gamma):                       ||  iris = datasets.load_iris()                   |     iris = datasets.load_iris()            ||  perm = permutation(iris.target.size)          |     per = permutation(iris.target.size)    ||  iris.data = iris.data[perm]                   |     iris.data = iris.data[per]             ||  iris.target = iris.target[perm]               |     iris.target = iris.target[per]         ||  clf = svm.SVC(C=C, kernel='rbf',              |     clf = svm.SVC(C=C, kernel='rbf',       ||          gamma=gamma)                          |             gamma=gamma)                   ||  clf.fit(iris.data[:90],                       |     clf.fit(iris.data[:90],                ||          iris.target[:90])                     |             iris.target[:90])              ||  print(clf.score(iris.data[90:],               |     return clf.score(iris.data[90:],       ||                  iris.target[90:]))            |                      iris.target[90:])     |+------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+Documentation-------------The documentation is hosted at `ReadTheDocs &lt;http://sacred.readthedocs.org/&gt;`_.Installing----------You can directly install it from the Python Package Index with pip:    pip install sacredOr if you want to do it manually you can checkout the current version from gitand install it yourself:   | git clone https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred.git   | cd sacred   | python setup.py installYou might want to also install the ``numpy`` and the ``pymongo`` packages. They areoptional dependencies but they offer some cool features:    pip install numpy pymongoTests-----The tests for sacred use the `pytest &lt;http://pytest.org/latest/&gt;`_ package.You can execute them by running ``pytest`` in the sacred directory like this:    pytestThere is also a config file for `tox &lt;https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_ so youcan automatically run the tests for various python versions like this:    toxUpdate pytest version+++++++++++++++++++++If you update or change the pytest version, the following files need to be changed:- ``dev-requirements.txt``- ``tox.ini``- ``test/test_utils.py``- ``setup.py``Contributing------------If you find a bug, have a feature request or want to discuss something general you are welcome to open an`issue &lt;https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred/issues&gt;`_. If you have a specific question relatedto the usage of sacred, please ask a question on StackOverflow under the`python-sacred tag &lt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-sacred&gt;`_. We value documentationa lot. If you find something that should be included in the documentation pleasedocument it or let us know whats missing. If you are using Sacred in one of your projects and want to shareyour code with others, put your repo in the `Projects using Sacred &lt;docs/projects_using_sacred.rst`&gt;_ list.Pull requests are highly welcome!Frontends---------At this point there are three frontends to the database entries created by sacred (that I'm aware of).They are developed externally as separate projects.`Omniboard &lt;https://github.com/vivekratnavel/omniboard&gt;`_+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.. image:: docs/images/omniboard-table.png.. image:: docs/images/omniboard-metric-graphs.pngOmniboard is a web dashboard that helps in visualizing the experiments and metrics / logs collected by sacred.Omniboard is written with React, Node.js, Express and Bootstrap.`Incense &lt;https://github.com/JarnoRFB/incense&gt;`_+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.. image:: docs/images/incense-artifact.png.. image:: docs/images/incense-metric.pngIncense is a Python library to retrieve runs stored in a MongoDB and interactively display metrics and artifactsin Jupyter notebooks.`Sacredboard &lt;https://github.com/chovanecm/sacredboard&gt;`_+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.. image:: docs/images/sacredboard.pngSacredboard is a web-based dashboard interface to the sacred runs stored in aMongoDB.`Neptune &lt;https://neptune.ai/&gt;`_+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.. image:: docs/images/neptune-compare.png.. image:: docs/images/neptune-collaboration.pngNeptune is a metadata store for MLOps, built for teams that run a lot of experiments.It gives you a single place to log, store, display, organize, compare, and query all your model-building metadata via API available for both Python and R programming languages:.. image:: docs/images/neptune-query-api.pngIn order to log your sacred experiments to Neptune, all you need to do is add an observer:.. code-block:: python    from neptune.new.integrations.sacred import NeptuneObserver    ex.observers.append(NeptuneObserver(api_token='&lt;YOUR_API_TOKEN&gt;',                                        project='&lt;YOUR_WORKSPACE/YOUR_PROJECT&gt;'))For more info, check the `Neptune + Sacred integration guide &lt;https://docs.neptune.ai/integrations-and-supported-tools/experiment-tracking/sacred&gt;`_.`SacredBrowser &lt;https://github.com/michaelwand/SacredBrowser&gt;`_+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.. image:: docs/images/sacred_browser.pngSacredBrowser is a PyQt4 application to browse the MongoDB entries created bysacred experiments.Features include custom queries, sorting of the results,access to the stored source-code, and many more.No installation is required and it can connect to a localdatabase or over the network.`Prophet &lt;https://github.com/Qwlouse/prophet&gt;`_+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Prophet is an early prototype of a webinterface to the MongoDB entries created bysacred experiments, that is discontinued.It requires you to run `RestHeart &lt;http://restheart.org&gt;`_ to access the database.Related Projects----------------`Sumatra &lt;https://pythonhosted.org/Sumatra/&gt;`_++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   | Sumatra is a tool for managing and tracking projects based on numerical   | simulation and/or analysis, with the aim of supporting reproducible research.   | It can be thought of as an automated electronic lab notebook for   | computational projects.Sumatra takes a different approach by providing commandline tools to initializea project and then run arbitrary code (not just python).It tracks information about all runs in a SQL database and even provides a nice browser tool.It integrates less tightly with the code to be run, which makes it easilyapplicable to non-python experiments.But that also means it requires more setup for each experiment andconfiguration needs to be done using files.Use this project if you need to run non-python experiments, or are ok with the additional setup/configuration overhead.`Future Gadget Laboratory &lt;https://github.com/Kaixhin/FGLab&gt;`_++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   | FGLab is a machine learning dashboard, designed to make prototyping   | experiments easier. Experiment details and results are sent to a database,   | which allows analytics to be performed after their completion. The server   | is FGLab, and the clients are FGMachines.Similar to Sumatra, FGLab is an external tool that can keep track of runs fromany program. Projects are configured via a JSON schema and the program needs toaccept these configurations via command-line options.FGLab also takes the role of a basic scheduler by distributing runs over severalmachines.License-------This project is released under the terms of the `MIT license &lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT&gt;`_.Citing Sacred-------------`K.
