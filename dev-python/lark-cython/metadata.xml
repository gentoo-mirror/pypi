	<longdescription># Lark-CythonCython plugin for [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark), reimplementing the LALR parser &amp;amp; lexer for better performance on CPython.Install:```pythonpip install lark-cython```Usage:```pythonimport lark_cythonparser = Lark(grammar, parser=&quot;lalr&quot;, _plugins=lark_cython.plugins)# Use Lark as you usually would, with a huge performance boost```See the [examples](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark_cython/tree/master/examples) for more.## Differences from Lark- `Token` instances do not inherit from `str`. You must use the `value` attribute to get the string.## Other caveats- Postlexer isn't currently implemented## SpeedIn current benchmarks, lark-cython is about 50% to 80% faster than Lark.We're still in the early stages, and in the future, lark-cython might go a lot faster.## OtherLicense: MITAuthor: [Erez Shinan](https://github.com/erezsh/)Special thanks goes to [Datafold](https://github.com/datafold) for commissioning the draft for lark-cython, and allowing me to release it as open-source.</longdescription>
