This allows for fast randomaccess when reading, but this is not supported by Python's builtin `lzma` module (whichwould read all previous blocks for nothing).&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;|                   |      [lzma]       |      [lzmaffi]       |      python-xz       || :---------------: | :---------------: | :------------------: | :------------------: ||    module type    |      builtin      |  cffi (C extension)  |     pure Python      ||    üìÑ **read**    |                   |                      |                      ||   random access   | ‚ùå no&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; |  ‚úîÔ∏è yes&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  |  ‚úîÔ∏è yes&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  ||  several blocks   |      ‚úîÔ∏è yes       | ‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è yes&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; | ‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è yes&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ||  several streams  |      ‚úîÔ∏è yes       |        ‚úîÔ∏è yes        | ‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è yes&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; ||  stream padding   | ‚ùå no&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; |        ‚úîÔ∏è yes        |        ‚úîÔ∏è yes        ||   üìù **write**    |                   |                      |                      ||     `w` mode      |      ‚úîÔ∏è yes       |        ‚úîÔ∏è yes        |        ‚úîÔ∏è yes        ||     `x` mode      |      ‚úîÔ∏è yes       |        ‚ùå no         |        ‚úîÔ∏è yes        ||     `a` mode      |   ‚úîÔ∏è new stream   |    ‚úîÔ∏è new stream     |      ‚è≥ planned      || `r+`/`w+`/‚Ä¶ modes |       ‚ùå no       |        ‚ùå no         |        ‚úîÔ∏è yes        ||  several blocks   |       ‚ùå no       |        ‚ùå no         |        ‚úîÔ∏è yes        ||  several streams  | ‚ùå no&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; |  ‚ùå no&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;   |        ‚úîÔ∏è yes        ||  stream padding   |       ‚ùå no       |        ‚ùå no         |      ‚è≥ planned      |&lt;/div&gt;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Notes&lt;/summary&gt;1. Reading from a position will read the file from the very beginning2. Reading from a position will read the file from the beginning of the block3. Block positions available with the `block_boundaries` attribute4. Stream positions available with the `stream_boundaries` attribute5. Related [issue](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/88300)6. Possible by manually closing and re-opening in append mode&lt;/details&gt;[lzma]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html[lzmaffi]: https://github.com/r3m0t/backports.lzma---## InstallInstall `python-xz` with pip:```sh$ python -m pip install python-xz```_An unofficial package for conda is [also available][conda package], see [issue #5][#5]for more information._[conda package]: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/python-xz[#5]: https://github.com/Rogdham/python-xz/issues/5## UsageThe API is similar to [lzma]: you can use either `xz.open` or `xz.XZFile`.### Read mode```python&gt;&gt;&gt; with xz.open('example.xz') as fin:...     fin.read(18)...     fin.stream_boundaries  # 2 streams...     fin.block_boundaries   # 4 blocks in first stream, 2 blocks in second stream...     fin.seek(1000)...     fin.read(31)...b'Hello, world! \xf0\x9f\x91\x8b'[0, 2000][0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000]1000b'\xe2\x9c\xa8 Random access is fast! \xf0\x9f\x9a\x80'```Opening in text mode works as well, but notice that seek arguments as well as boundariesare still in bytes (just like with `lzma.open`).```python&gt;&gt;&gt; with xz.open('example.xz', 'rt') as fin:...     fin.read(15)...     fin.stream_boundaries...     fin.block_boundaries...     fin.seek(1000)...     fin.read(26)...'Hello, world! üëã'[0, 2000][0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000]1000'‚ú® Random access is fast! üöÄ'```### Write modeWriting is only supported from the end of file. It is however possible to truncate thefile first. Note that truncating is only supported on block boundaries.```python&gt;&gt;&gt; with xz.open('test.xz', 'w') as fout:...     fout.write(b'Hello, world!\n')...     fout.write(b'This sentence is still in the previous block\n')...     fout.change_block()...     fout.write(b'But this one is in its own!\n')...144528```Advanced usage:- Modes like `r+`/`w+`/`x+` allow to open for both read and write at the same time;  however in the current implementation, a block with writing in progress is  automatically closed when reading data from it.- The `check`, `preset` and `filters` arguments to `xz.open` and `xz.XZFile` allow to  configure the default values for new streams and blocks.- Change block with the `change_block` method (the `preset` and `filters` attributes can  be changed beforehand to apply to the new block).- Change stream with the `change_stream` method (the `check` attribute can be changed  beforehand to apply to the new stream).---## FAQ### How does random-access works?XZ files are made of a number of streams, and each stream is composed of a number ofblock. This can be seen with `xz --list`:```sh$ xz --list file.xzStrms  Blocks   Compressed Uncompressed  Ratio  Check   Filename    1      13     16.8 MiB    297.9 MiB  0.056  CRC64   file.xz```To read data from the middle of the 10th block, we will decompress the 10th block fromits start it until we reach the middle (and drop that decompressed data), then returnedthe decompressed data from that point.Choosing the good block size is a tradeoff between seeking time during random access andcompression ratio.### How can I create XZ files optimized for random-access?You can open the file for writing and use the `change_block` method to create severalblocks.Other tools allow to create XZ files with several blocks as well:- [XZ Utils](https://tukaani.org/xz/) needs to be called with flags:```sh$ xz -T0 file                          # threading mode$ xz --block-size 16M file             # same size for all blocks$ xz --block-list 16M,32M,8M,42M file  # specific size for each block```- [PIXZ](https://github.com/vasi/pixz) creates files with several blocks by default:```sh$ pixz file```### Python version supportAs a general rule, all Python versions that are both [released and still officiallysupported][python-versions] are supported by `python-xz` and tested against (bothCPython and PyPy implementations).If you have other use cases or find issues with some Python versions, feel free to[open a ticket](https://github.com/Rogdham/python-xz/issues/new)![python-versions]: https://devguide.python.org/versions/#versions</longdescription>
