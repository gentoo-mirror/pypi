The focus is on imaging sensors like AVHRR, VIIRS, MODIS, ABI,AHI, OLCI and SEVIRI. But more sensors are included and if others are needed they canbe easily added. With Pyspectral it is possible to derive the reflective andemissive parts of the signal observed in any NIR band around 3-4 microns whereboth passive terrestrial emission and solar backscatter mix the informationreceived by the satellite. Furthermore Pyspectral allows correcting true colorimagery for the background (climatological) atmospheric signal due to Rayleighscattering of molecules, absorption by atmospheric gases and aerosols, and Miescattering of aerosols.Adam DybbroeMay 2021, Norrkoping, Sweden</longdescription>
