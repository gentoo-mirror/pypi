The tool is based on a flexible and powerful Gaussian process regression at the core. The flexibility stems from the modular design of gpCAM which allows the user to implement and import their own Python functions to customize and control almost every aspect of the software. That makes it possible to easily tune the algorithm to account for various kinds of physics and other domain knowledge, and to identify and find interesting features. A specialized function optimizer in gpCAM can take advantage of HPC architectures for fast analysis time and reactive autonomous data acquisition.## UsageThe following demonstrates a simple usage of the gpCAM API (see [interactive demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FU4iKW626XiLqluDXQH-gzPYHyCf9N76?usp=sharing)). ```pythonfrom gpcam.autonomous_experimenter import AutonomousExperimenterGPimport numpy as npdef instrument(data):    for entry in data:        entry[&quot;value&quot;] = np.sin(np.linalg.norm(entry[&quot;position&quot;]))    return data##set up your parameter spaceparameters = np.array([[3.0,45.8],                       [4.0,47.0]])##set up some hyperparameters, if you have no idea, set them to 1 and make the training bounds largeinit_hyperparameters = np.array([1,1,1])hyperparameter_bounds =  np.array([[0.01,100],[0.01,100.0],[0.01,100]])##let's initialize the autonomous experimenter ...my_ae = AutonomousExperimenterGP(parameters, init_hyperparameters,                                 hyperparameter_bounds,instrument_func = instrument,                                   init_dataset_size=10)#...train...my_ae.train()#...and run. That's it. You successfully executed an autonomous experiment.my_ae.go(N = 100)```## CreditsMain Developer: Marcus Noack ([MarcusNoack@lbl.gov](mailto:MarcusNoack@lbl.gov))Many people from across the DOE national labs (especially BNL) have given insightsthat led to the code in it's current form.See [AUTHORS](AUTHORS.rst) for more details on that.=======History=======6.0.0 (2020-10-26)------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>
