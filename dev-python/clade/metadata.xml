	<longdescription>[![GitHub Actions status](https://github.com/17451k/clade/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/17451k/clade/actions?query=workflow%3Atest)[![Supported Versions of Python](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/clade.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/clade)[![PyPI package version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/clade.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/clade)# CladeClade is a tool for intercepting build commands (stuff like compilation,linking, mv, rm, and all other commands that are executed during build).Intercepted commands can be parsed (to search for input and output files,and options) and then used for various purposes:- generating [compilation database](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html);- obtaining information about dependencies between source and object files;- obtaining information about the source code (source code querying);- generating function call graph;- running software verification tools;- visualization of all collected information;- *and for much more*.The interception of build commands is independent of the project typeand used programming languages.However, all other functionality available in Clade **IS** dependent.Currently only C projects are supported, but other languages and additionalfunctionality can be supported through the built-in *extension mechanism*.## PrerequisitesAn important part of Clade - a build commands intercepting library -is written in C and it needs to be compiled before use.It will be performed automatically at the installation stage, but you willneed to install some prerequisites beforehand:- Python 3 (&gt;=3.5)- pip (Python package manager)- cmake (&gt;=3.3)*Linux only*:- make- C **and** C++ compiler (gcc or clang)- python3-dev (Ubuntu) or python3-devel (openSUSE) package- gcc-multilib (Ubuntu) or gcc-32bit (openSUSE) package  to intercept build commands of projects leveraging multilib capabilities*Windows only*:- Microsoft Visual C++ Build ToolsOptional dependencies:- For obtaining information about the C code you will need [CIF](https://github.com/17451k/cif)  installed. CIF is an interface to [Aspectator](https://github.com/17451k/aspectator) which in turn is a GCC  based tool that implements aspect-oriented programming for the C programming  language. You may download compiled CIF on [CIF releases](https://github.com/17451k/cif/releases) page.- Graphviz for some visualization capabilities.Clade works on Linux, macOS and partially on Windows.## Hardware requirementsIf you want to run Clade on a large project, like the Linux kernel,you will need at least 16GB of RAM and 100GB of free disk spacefor temporary files. The size of generated data will be approximately10GB, so the space used for temporary files will be freed at the end.Also several CPU cores are recommended, since in some cases Clade takestwice as long time than a typical build process.## InstallationTo install the latest stable version just run the following command:``` shell$ python3 -m pip install clade```## DocumentationFollowing documentation is available:* [Basic usage](docs/usage.md)* [Available configuration options](docs/configuration.md)* [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)* [Development documentation](docs/dev.md)## AcknowledgmentsClade is inspired by the [Bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) project created by [László Nagy](https://github.com/rizsotto).</longdescription>
