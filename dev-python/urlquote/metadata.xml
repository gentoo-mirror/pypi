	<longdescription>Urlquote========Fast percent encoding / decoding for python.**This library is not intended to be a replacement for urllib**. `urllib` is part of the Python standard library and should be your go-to choice to quote and unquote URLs. However, should quoting or unquoting of URLs be known to be a performance bottleneck and you are fine with the encoding described below, then by all means have fun using this library.Usage-----```pythonfrom urlquote import quotequoted = quote('/El Ni√±o/')assert(quoted == '/El%20Ni%C3%B1o/'.encode('utf-8'))```Compatibility-------------Since this library uses a `cffi` interface it should work fine with any version of Python. For Linux the wheel has to be build against a version of libc older or equal to the version of libc on the platform the wheel will be used on.Installation------------```bashpip install urlquote````quote` operates on UTF-8-encoded bytes. If passed a string, it will encode it into UTF-8 first. It will always return UTF-8-encoded bytes. `unquote` behaves the same way.Encoding--------The following encodings are offered. `DEFAULT_QUOTING` is used in case the quoting parameter is not specified.| Name                 | Additional encoded characters                                                                                       ||----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| SIMPLE_QUOTING       |                                                                                                                     || DEFAULT_QUOTING      | space, `&lt;`,`&gt;`,`` ` ``,`?`,`{`,`}`                                                                                  || QUERY_QUOTING        | space, `&quot;`,`#`,`&lt;`,`&gt;`                                                                                              || PATH_SEGMENT_QUOTING | space, `&quot;`,`#`,`&lt;`,`&gt;`,`` ` ``,`?`,`%`,`/`                                                                          || USERINFO_QUOTING     | space, `&quot;`,`#`,`&lt;`,`&gt;`,`` ` ``,`?`,`{`,`}`,`/`,`:`,`;`,`=`,`@`,`\`,`[`,`]`,`^`,`\|`                                 || PYTHON_3_7_QUOTING   | space, `&quot;`,`#`,`&lt;`,`&gt;`,`` ` ``,`?`,`{`,`}`,`$`,`%`,`&amp;`,`\`,`(`,`)`,`,`,`=`,`;`,`:`,`!`,`@`,`[`,`]`,`^`,`\|`,`+`,`*` |Non printable and non standard ASCII characters are always quoted. The `PYTHON_3_7_QUOTING` is going to work the same way in every Python version the name is only refering to the `urllib` default encoding used in Python 3.7.Development-----------This library is a thin wrapper around the Rust crate [`percent-encoding`](https://crates.io/crates/percent-encoding). It exposes part of its functionality to python via a C interface using [`cffi`](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).To build it you need to [install Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html). Than you can proceed to build the wheel with:```bashpython -m pip install build```To setup the development environment run:```bashpython -m pip install -e .[test]```To execute the tests run```bashpytest```There are also some Rust-only unit tests. To execute them change into the `rust` subdirectory and call.```bashcargo test```Links-----* PyPI package: &lt;https://pypi.org/project/urlquote/&gt;* Conda feedstock: &lt;https://github.com/conda-forge/urlquote-feedstock&gt;Support-------This tool is provided as is under an MIT license without any warranty or SLA.
