	<longdescription># mitreattack-pythonThis repository contains a library of Python tools and utilities for working with ATT&amp;CK data. For more information,see the [full documentation](https://mitreattack-python.readthedocs.io/) on ReadTheDocs.## InstallTo use this package, install the mitreattack-python library with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):```shellpip install mitreattack-python```Note: the library requires [python3](https://www.python.org/).## MitreAttackData LibraryThe ``MitreAttackData`` library is used to read in and work with MITRE ATT&amp;CK STIX 2.0 content. This library provides the ability to query the dataset for objects and their related objects. This is the main content of mitreattack-python;you can read more about other modules in this library under &quot;Additional Modules&quot;.## Additional ModulesMore detailed information and examples about the specific usage of the additional modules in this package can be found in the individual README files for each module linked below.| module | description | documentation ||:------------|:------------|:--------------|| [navlayers](https://github.com/mitre-attack/mitreattack-python/tree/master/mitreattack/navlayers) | A collection of utilities for working with [ATT&amp;CK Navigator](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-navigator) layers. Provides the ability to import, export, and manipulate layers. Layers can be read in from the filesystem or python dictionaries, combined and edited, and then exported to excel or SVG images. | Further documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/mitre-attack/mitreattack-python/blob/master/mitreattack/navlayers/README.md).|| [attackToExcel](https://github.com/mitre-attack/mitreattack-python/tree/master/mitreattack/attackToExcel) | A collection of utilities for converting [ATT&amp;CK STIX data](https://github.com/mitre/cti) to Excel spreadsheets. It also provides access to [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrames representing the dataset for use in data analysis. | Further documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/mitre-attack/mitreattack-python/blob/master/mitreattack/attackToExcel/README.md).|| [collections](https://github.com/mitre-attack/mitreattack-python/tree/master/mitreattack/collections) | A set of utilities for working with [ATT&amp;CK Collections and Collection Indexes](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend/blob/master/docs/collections.md). Provides functionalities for converting and summarizing data in collections and collection indexes, as well as generating a collection from a raw stix bundle input. | Further documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/mitre-attack/mitreattack-python/blob/master/mitreattack/collections/README.md).|| [diffStix](https://github.com/mitre-attack/mitreattack-python/tree/master/mitreattack/diffStix) | Create markdown, HTML, JSON and/or ATT&amp;CK Navigator layers reporting on the changes between two versions of the STIX2 bundles representing the ATT&amp;CK content. Run `diff_stix -h` for full usage instructions. | Further documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/mitre-attack/mitreattack-python/blob/master/mitreattack/diffStix/README.md).|## Related MITRE Work### CTI[Cyber Threat Intelligence repository](https://github.com/mitre/cti) of the ATT&amp;CK catalog expressed in STIX 2.0 JSON.This repository also contains [our USAGE document](https://github.com/mitre/cti/blob/master/USAGE.md) which includesadditional examples of accessing and parsing our dataset in Python.### ATT&amp;CKATT&amp;CK® is a curated knowledge base and model for cyber adversary behavior, reflecting the various phases ofan adversary’s lifecycle, and the platforms they are known to target.ATT&amp;CK is useful for understanding security risk against known adversary behavior,for planning security improvements, and verifying defenses work as expected.&lt;https://attack.mitre.org&gt;### STIXStructured Threat Information Expression (STIX&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt;) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI).STIX enables organizations to share CTI with one another in a consistent and machine-readable manner,allowing security communities to better understand what computer-based attacks they are most likely tosee and to anticipate and/or respond to those attacks faster and more effectively.STIX is designed to improve many capabilities, such as collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response, and more.&lt;https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/&gt;### ATT&amp;CK scriptsOne-off scripts and code examples you can use as inspiration for how to work with ATT&amp;CK programmatically. Many of the functionalities found in the mitreattack-python package were originally posted on attack-scripts.&lt;https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-scripts&gt;## ContributingTo contribute to this project, either through a bug report, feature request, or merge request,please see the [Contributors Guide](https://github.com/mitre-attack/mitreattack-python/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).## NoticeCopyright 2022 The MITRE CorporationApproved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.
