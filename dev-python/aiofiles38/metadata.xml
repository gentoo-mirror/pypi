	<longdescription>aiofiles: file support for asyncio==================================.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/aiofiles.svg        :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aiofiles.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/Tinche/aiofiles.svg?branch=master        :target: https://travis-ci.org/Tinche/aiofiles.. image:: https://codecov.io/gh/Tinche/aiofiles/branch/master/graph/badge.svg        :target: https://codecov.io/gh/Tinche/aiofiles.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/aiofiles.svg        :target: https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles        :alt: Supported Python versions**aiofiles** is an Apache2 licensed library, written in Python, for handling localdisk files in asyncio applications.Ordinary local file IO is blocking, and cannot easily and portably madeasynchronous. This means doing file IO may interfere with asyncio applications,which shouldn't block the executing thread. aiofiles helps with this byintroducing asynchronous versions of files that support delegating operations toa separate thread pool... code-block:: python    async with aiofiles.open('filename', mode='r') as f:        contents = await f.read()    print(contents)    'My file contents'Asynchronous iteration is also supported... code-block:: python    async with aiofiles.open('filename') as f:        async for line in f:            ...Features--------- a file API very similar to Python's standard, blocking API- support for buffered and unbuffered binary files, and buffered text files- support for ``async``/``await`` (:PEP:`492`) constructsInstallation------------To install aiofiles, simply:.. code-block:: bash    $ pip install aiofilesUsage-----Files are opened using the ``aiofiles.open()`` coroutine, which in addition tomirroring the builtin ``open`` accepts optional ``loop`` and ``executor``arguments. If ``loop`` is absent, the default loop will be used, as per theset asyncio policy. If ``executor`` is not specified, the default event loopexecutor will be used.In case of success, an asynchronous file object is returned with anAPI identical to an ordinary file, except the following methods are coroutinesand delegate to an executor:* ``close``* ``flush``* ``isatty``* ``read``* ``readall``* ``read1``* ``readinto``* ``readline``* ``readlines``* ``seek``* ``seekable``* ``tell``* ``truncate``* ``writable``* ``write``* ``writelines``In case of failure, one of the usual exceptions will be raised.The ``aiofiles.os`` module contains executor-enabled coroutine versions ofseveral useful ``os`` functions that deal with files:* ``stat``* ``sendfile``* ``rename``* ``remove``* ``mkdir``* ``rmdir``Writing tests for aiofiles~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Real file IO can be mocked by patching ``aiofiles.threadpool.sync_open``as desired. The return type also needs to be registered with the``aiofiles.threadpool.wrap`` dispatcher:.. code-block:: python    aiofiles.threadpool.wrap.register(mock.MagicMock)(        lambda *args, **kwargs: threadpool.AsyncBufferedIOBase(*args, **kwargs))    async def test_stuff():        data = 'data'        mock_file = mock.MagicMock()        with mock.patch('aiofiles.threadpool.sync_open', return_value=mock_file) as mock_open:            async with aiofiles.open('filename', 'w') as f:                await f.write(data)            mock_file.write.assert_called_once_with(data)History~~~~~~~0.4.0 (2018-08-11)``````````````````- Python 3.7 support.- Removed Python 3.3/3.4 support. If you use these versions, stick to aiofiles 0.3.x.0.3.2 (2017-09-23)``````````````````- The LICENSE is now included in the sdist.  `#31 &lt;https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles/pull/31&gt;`_0.3.1 (2017-03-10)``````````````````- Introduced a changelog.- ``aiofiles.os.sendfile`` will now work if the standard ``os`` module contains a ``sendfile`` function.Contributing~~~~~~~~~~~~Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with ``tox``, please ensurethe coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.</longdescription>
