	<longdescription># reindentPackaged Tools/scripts/reindent from cpython```reindent [-d][-r][-v] [ path ... ]-d (--dryrun)   Dry run.   Analyze, but don't make any changes to, files.-r (--recurse)  Recurse.   Search for all .py files in subdirectories too.-n (--nobackup) No backup. Does not make a &quot;.bak&quot; file before reindenting.-v (--verbose)  Verbose.   Print informative msgs; else no output.   (--newline)  Newline.   Specify the newline character to use (CRLF, LF).                           Default is the same as the original file.-h (--help)     Help.      Print this usage information and exit.```Change Python (.py) files to use 4-space indents and no hard tab characters.Also trim excess spaces and tabs from ends of lines, and remove empty linesat the end of files.  Also ensure the last line ends with a newline.If no paths are given on the command line, reindent operates as a filter,reading a single source file from standard input and writing the transformedsource to standard output.  In this case, the `-d`, `-r` and `-v` flags areignored.You can pass one or more file and/or directory paths.  When a directorypath, all .py files within the directory will be examined, and, if the `-r`option is given, likewise recursively for subdirectories.If output is not to standard output, reindent overwrites files in place,renaming the originals with a .bak extension.  If it finds nothing tochange, the file is left alone.  If reindent does change a file, the changedfile is a fixed-point for future runs (i.e., running reindent on theresulting .py file won't change it again).The hard part of reindenting is figuring out what to do with commentlines.  So long as the input files get a clean bill of health fromtabnanny.py, reindent should do a good job.The backup file is a copy of the one that is being reindented. The &quot;.bak&quot;file is generated with shutil.copy(), but some corner cases regardinguser/group and permissions could leave the backup file more readable thanyou'd prefer. You can always use the `--nobackup` option to prevent this.</longdescription>
