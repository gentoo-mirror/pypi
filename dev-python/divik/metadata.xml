This is the most convenient way, if you wantto use `divik` application.To install latest stable version use:```bashdocker pull gmrukwa/divik```### Python packagePrerequisites for installation of base package:- Python 3.7 / 3.8 / 3.9- compiler capable of compiling the native C code and OpenMP support#### Installation of OpenMP for Ubuntu / DebianYou should have it already installed with GCC compiler, but if somehownot, try the following:```bashsudo apt-get install libgomp1```#### Installation of OpenMP for MacOpenMP is available as part of LLVM. You may need to install it with conda:```bashconda install -c conda-forge &quot;compilers&gt;=1.0.4,!=1.1.0&quot; llvm-openmp```#### Installation of dependencied on MacYou may see messages that some dependencies are invalid for the platform.It is a [known bug](https://github.com/actions/setup-python/issues/469),with [a workaround](https://github.com/actions/setup-python/issues/469#issuecomment-1192522949).Use:```bashSYSTEM_VERSION_COMPAT=0 pip install divik```#### DiviK InstallationHaving prerequisites installed, one can install latest base version of thepackage:```bashpip install divik```If you want to have compatibility with[`gin-config`](https://github.com/google/gin-config), you can installnecessary extras with:```bashpip install divik[gin]```**Note:** Remember about `\` before `[` and `]` in `zsh` shell.You can install all extras with:```bashpip install divik[all]```## High-Volume Data ConsiderationsIf you are using DiviK to run the analysis that could fail to fit RAM of yourcomputer, consider disabling the default parallelism and switch to[dask](https://dask.org/). It's easy to achieve through configuration:- set all parameters named `n_jobs` to `1`;- set all parameters named `allow_dask` to `True`.**Note:** Never set `n_jobs&gt;1` and `allow_dask=True` at the same time, thecomputations will freeze due to how `multiprocessing` and `dask` handleparallelism.## Known Issues### Segmentation FaultIt can happen if the he `gamred_native` package (part of `divik` package) wascompiled with different numpy ABI than scikit-learn. This could happen if youused different set of compilers than the developers of the scikit-learnpackage.In such a case, a handler is defined to display the stack trace. If the tracecomes from `_matlab_legacy.py`, the most probably this is the issue.To resolve the issue, consider following the installation instructions onceagain. The exact versions get updated to avoid the issue.## ContributingContribution guide will be developed soon.Format the code with:```bashisort -m 3 --fgw 3 --tc .black -t py36 .```## ReferencesThis software is part of contribution made by [Data Mining Group of SilesianUniversity of Technology](http://www.zaed.polsl.pl/), rest of which ispublished [here](https://github.com/ZAEDPolSl).- [Mrukwa, G. and Polanska, J., 2020.
