	<longdescription># Napari - Arnheim### IdeaNapari Arnheim bundles Napari with the Arnheim Framework Client and its Grunnlag-Provider ### PrerequisitesNapari Arnheim only works with a running Arnheim Instance (in your network or locally for debugging) and a Grunnlag-Provider. (see Grunnlag)### UsageIn order to initialize the Client you need to connect it as a Valid Application with your Arnheim Instance```pythonbergen = Bergen(host=&quot;HOST_NAME&quot;,    port=8000,  client_id=&quot;APPLICATION_ID_FROM_ARNHEIM&quot;,   client_secret=&quot;APPLICATION_SECRET_FROM_ARNHEIM&quot;,  name=&quot;karl&quot;,)with napari.gui_qt():    viewer = napari.Viewer()    viewer.window.add_dock_widget(ArnheimWidget(bergen=bergen), area=&quot;right&quot;)```### Testing and DocumentationSo far Bergen does only provide limitedunit-tests and is in desperate need of documentation,please beware that you are using an Alpha-Version### Build with- [Arnheim](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/arnheim)- [Bergen](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/bergen)- [Grunnlag](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/grunnlag)- [Napari](https://github.com/napari/napari)## RoadmapThis is considered pre-Alpha so pretty much everything is still on the roadmap## DeploymentContact the Developer before you plan to deploy this App, it is NOT ready for public release## VersioningThere is not yet a working versioning profile in place, consider non-stable for every release ## Authors* **Johannes Roos ** - *Initial work* - [jhnnsrs](https://github.com/jhnnsrs)See also the list of [contributors](https://github.com/your/project/contributors) who participated in this project.## LicenseAttribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC 3.0) ## Acknowledgments* EVERY single open-source project this library used (the list is too extensive so far)</longdescription>
