Contributions in the form of raised issues and pull requests are much needed in order to maintain the functionality for all different models of Skoda cars.Up until now I have maintained this code after lendy007 and I have had my own interest in it since I've been using it for controlling my own Skoda. My Skoda Connect subscription is now expired and I won't be renewing it because I'm switching from my current Skoda to another car in the near future. This means that this project needs you, someone familiar with Python and an interest in keeping this code alive, in order to not stop working after the next VAG update.Please contact me on the Discord or through email if this person is you./TheFarfar (Farfar)# Skoda Connect**UNOFFICIAL** library for communicating with Skoda Connect.Fork of https://github.com/robinostlund/volkswagencarnet,modified to support Skoda Connect.Changes has been made to mimic the MySkoda mobile app.This is an API library for Skoda connected cars.The library is reverse engineered by intercepting HTTP requests fromMySkoda app, there is no official API. Use at your own risk.If the Skoda API changes, this library may stop working without warning.Version 1.x is in maintenance only.All feature requests and major changes will be for version 2.0 (under development)## InformationRetrieve statistics about your Skoda from the Skoda Connect online service.* Support for Skoda Connect services* Support for SmartLink* All (native) Skoda cars supported though newer cars (Skoda Enyaq iV) use newer API that's under development* If your Skoda car don't work with the MySkoda app it won't work with this integrationPlease contribute improvements/bugfixes etc.## Breaking changes- **From version 1.1.0** and onwards there has been changes to token handling, login procedure and overall mode streamlined code. Logins should now be significantly faster and reliable.- **From version 1.0.40** and onwards there has been changes to Skoda API and this might break the integration for some cars.- **From version 1.0.30** and onwards there might be breaking changes for the combustion heating/climatisation.- **Parking Heater** is the auxiliary/parking heater for **non-PHEV** vehicles. This uses the &quot;legacy&quot; remotestandheizung API function.Heating is what it sounds like and ventilation is used to ventilate/cool the car.- **Auxiliary Heater** is the auxiliary/parking heater for **PHEV** vehicles. This uses the climater API function, same as electric climatisation.## Thanks to- [RobinostLund](https://github.com/robinostlund/volkswagencarnet) for initial project for Volkswagen Carnet which this is based on initially- [lendy007](https://github.com/lendy007) for creating intial release for Skoda cars- [Farfar](https://github.com/Farfar) for modifications related to electric engines- [tanelvakker](https://github.com/tanelvakker) for modifications related to correct SPIN handling for various actions and using correct URLs also for MY2021- [wieshka](https://github.com/wieshka) for help with Skoda Enyaq iV development- WebSpider and GAEvakYD from Discord for their help with fixing login form handling## Other related repositories- [HomeAssistant Component](https://github.com/lendy007/homeassistant-skodaconnect) a custom component for Home Assistant## Installation```sh[venv-python3] user@localhost:~$ pip install skodaconnect```### ExampleFor an extensive example, please use the code found in example/example.py.When logged in the library will automatically create a vehicle object for every car registered to the account. Initially no data is fetched at all. Use the doLogin method and it will signin with the credentials used for the class constructor.Method get_vehicles will fetch vehicle basic information and create Vehicle class objects for all associated vehicles in account.To update all available data use the update_all method of the Connect class. This will call the update function for all registered vehicles, which in turn will fetch data from all available API endpoints.#### AttributesThe Vehicle class contains all of the attributes with values fetched from the API.To access a single attribute, please see and use the example/example.py.This will print all available methods, variables and properties as well as a list of supported attributes for discovered car.#### MethodsVehicle, in the following example the car object is an object of Vehicle class:```car.set_charger(action = &quot;start&quot;)                          # action = &quot;start&quot; or &quot;stop&quot;car.set_charger_current(value=&lt;int/str&gt;                    # value = integer 1-255 or Maximum/Reduced (For PHEV: 252=Reduced and 254=Maximum)car.set_charge_limit(value=&lt;int&gt;)                          # value = integer 0-100 in 10 increments. Valid values is PHEV: 0-50, EV: 50-100.car.set_battery_climatisation(mode = False)                # mode = False or Truecar.set_climatisation(mode = &quot;auxilliary&quot;, spin=&quot;1234&quot;)    # mode = &quot;auxilliary&quot;, &quot;electric&quot;, &quot;off&quot;.
