	<longdescription># Arc 2.5.3### Python ASGI web framework for creating fast and dynamic web applications.Arc is a python ASGI web framework for creating dynamic web pages. Arc is still under heavy devlopment, and all help is appreciated. Arc is built using `Starlette`, and runs on the lighting fast `uvicorn` web server.## InstallationArc is relatively easy to get set up with. Arc is cross platform, and can be installed on any operating system. You can install it using pip.```# Windowspip install arcframework# Linuxpip3 install arcframework```## QuickstartArc is a very easy to use libary, and is similar to other micro frameworks such as Flask or Bottle, so learning it won't be too hard. The below is an example of an Arc application.```pyfrom arc import App, TextResponseapp = App()@app.route(&quot;/home&quot;)def home(request):    return TextResponse(&quot;Hello, World&quot;)if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    app.run()```Copy and paste the above and run your file, you'll get an output like the following in your console.```INFO: Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000INFO: Press CTRL + C to stop```Now go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/home, and you should see `Hello World` being displayed on the screen.## Issues/BugsArc is still under heavy development abd has loads of bugs and errors that I'm constantly working on resolving.
