	<longdescription># DBnomics PowerPoint (pptx) toolsThis CLI tool allows to update data coming from DBnomics in PowerPoint presentations.## UsageFirst, define a YAML metadata file describing the charts and tables on each slide to update.For example see [simple_presentation_1.yaml](./samples/simple_presentation_1.yaml).See the [metadata file](#metadata-file) section below for more details.The `dbnomics-pptx` CLI command provides 2 commands: `fetch` and `update`.### `fetch` commandThis command reads all the series needed by the charts and tables of all slides in the YAML metadata file, deduplicate and download them in a cache directory, where they are stored as JSON files.```bashdbnomics-pptx fetch samples/simple_presentation_1.yaml```Use the `-v` option to display debug messages.By default, the series that are already present in the cache directory are skipped, in order to avoid putting pressure on DBnomics servers.Use the `--force` option to always download them.### `update` commandThis command takes a PowerPoint presentation file in input, and a YAML metadata file, and updates the charts and tables defined in the metadata file, then saves the result in an output presentation file (it does not modify the input one).```bashdbnomics-pptx update samples/simple_presentation_1.pptx --metadata-file samples/simple_presentation_1.yaml samples/simple_presentation_1.output.pptx```Use the `-v` option to display debug messages.## Metadata fileHere is a dummy file with made-up IDs to show how it is structured:```yamlslides:  AE_GDP: # the ID of the slide (as defined in the slide notes, cf below)    charts:      US_EU_GDP: # the ID of the chart (as defined in the &quot;Selection pane&quot;)        series:          - id: OECD/GDP_GROWTH/W.USA.tracker_yoy # the ID of the series on DBnomics            name: United States          - id: OECD/GDP_GROWTH/W.Eurozone.tracker_yoy            name: Eurozone    tables:      EU_GDP: # the ID of the table (as defined in the &quot;Selection pane&quot;)        series:          - id: OECD/KEI/NAEXKP01.EA19.GP.A            name: Euro Area          - id: OECD/KEI/NAEXKP01.DEU.GP.A            name: Germany          - id: OECD/KEI/NAEXKP01.FRA.GP.A            name: France          - id: OECD/KEI/NAEXKP01.ITA.GP.A            name: Italy```### Slide IDTo be updated, a slide must have been given an ID. As PowerPoint does not provide a way to assign one, we decided to use a special string in the slide notes, by using the syntax `slide_id:xxx` where `xxx` is to be replaced with the real value. For example, in the YAML file above, the slide ID is `AE_GDP`, so we expect the corresponding slide notes to contain the string `slide_id:AE_GDP`.### Chart and table IDThe IDs of the charts and tables can be read or modified from the &quot;Selection pane&quot; in PowerPoint.The &quot;Selection pane&quot; can be opened with Alt+F10 in PowerPoint.Then you just have to select a chart or a table, and it will highlight the corresponding line in the &quot;Selection pane&quot;, showing its ID.You can also modify the ID to improve readability.Once you get the ID of a chart or a table, you can put it in the YAML file.In the previous example, the IDs are &quot;My chart 1&quot; and &quot;My table 1&quot;.See also:- [Manage objects with the Selection pane](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/manage-objects-with-the-selection-pane-a6b2fd3e-d769-46c1-9b9c-b94e04a72550)- [The PowerPoint Selection Pane](https://www.presentationpoint.com/blog/powerpoint-selection-pane/)</longdescription>
