With Aksharify, you can convert your favorite images into an artistic arrangement of ASCII characters, adding a unique and nostalgic touch to your projects.Start transforming your photos into captivating ASCII art with Aksharify and unleash your creativity in the world of visual representation!## Key Features- Convert photos and images into ASCII art with a single function call.- Fine-tune the output by adjusting parameters such as character set, resolution etc.- Support for various character sets, allowing you to customize the style of the generated ASCII art.- Export the ASCII art as plain text or save it as an image file for easy sharing and integration.## What is AsciiArtASCII art is a style of art in which people make graphics and designs by using letters, numbers, and symbols from a unique set of characters known as ASCII. ASCII painters create intriguing images by arranging these characters in patterns and forms rather than using colours and brushes as in traditional art. They meticulously select the appropriate characters and combine them to produce images of animals, people, or even landscapes. It's almost as if you're sketching with letters and symbols! ASCII art is a fun way for artists to express themselves using only the basic characters present on a computer keyboard.&lt;!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT --&gt;## MotivationThe inspiration for this module came from a Numberphile video called &quot;The Trinity Hall Prime,&quot; which I first saw in high school days. It motivated me to explore the possibilities of such a prime number. I created a Python module that uses a predetermined character set to turn photos into ASCII art. It manipulates images using the PIL package, transforming them to grayscale before mapping pixel values to ASCII letters. Users can change the character set to get different effects.&lt;!-- GETTING STARTED --&gt;## Getting StartedBefore we begin, make sure you have one of recent versions of Python installed on your computer.### Installation```shpython -m pip install aksharify```## Usage```pythonfrom aksharify import AksharArtfrom aksharify.image import Imagefrom aksharify.distributions import Linearfrom aksharify.outputs import SVG``````pythonimage = Image(&quot;..\images\julia1.png&quot;)image.set_dim(200)image.show()``````pythonlin = Linear(&quot;01&quot;)lin.show()``````pythonart = AksharArt(image, lin)art.aksharify(show=True)``````pythonconfig = SVG()config.file_name = &quot;..\\art&quot;config.bold = True``````pythonart.svg_output(config)```_For examples from user community, please refer to the [primepatel.github.io/aksharify](https://primepatel.github.io/aksharify)_&lt;!-- ROADMAP --&gt;## Roadmap- [x] NumberiFy- [ ] Predifined order of characters- [ ] Getting images from URL- [ ] EmojiFySee the [open issues](https://github.com/github_username/repo_name/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).&lt;!-- CONTRIBUTING --&gt;## ContributingContributions are what make the open source community such a wonderful place to learn, be inspired, and create.
