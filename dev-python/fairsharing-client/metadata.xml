However, there are two aspects to FAIRsharing's data that make itdifficult to use:1. It's licensed under the restrictive [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license (   see https://fairsharing.org/licence). This makes it difficult to redistribute   the data, even in part. Better options for community reuse are [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) or   ideally [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/). However, keep in mind that FAIR and Open are emphatically   [not the same thing](https://www.go-fair.org/resources/faq/ask-question-difference-fair-data-open-data/).2. Instead of offering a bulk download, there is an API that requires   authentication using [JWT](https://jwt.io).While there's nothing wrong with JWT, it requires several steps that makeprogrammatic access inconvenient for less seasoned programmers.The `fairsharing_client` package provides a way to automatically bulk downloadall contents from the API and store them locally in a reproducible way, so youcan write code that relies on FAIRsharing data without having to worry about howto interact with its API nor redistribute its data yourself. Further,this package does some preprocessing on the content to make it more useful.```pythonimport fairsharing_client as fc# Download the data and return the path of the YAML file# This takes about 4 minutes and gets around 4K records.path = fc.ensure_fairsharing()# Download the data and open it for usedata = fc.load_fairsharing() # Get data for a given recordchebi_record = data[&quot;FAIRsharing.62qk8w&quot;]```There are a few ways to do authentication:1. **Envionment Variables**: set the `FAIRSHARING_LOGIN`   and `FAIRSHARING_PASSWORD` envionrment variables2. **Configuration**: in the `~/.config/fairshairing.ini` file, add the   following configuration:   ```ini   [fairsharing]   login = cthoyt@gmail.com   password = ...   ```3. **Keyword arguments**: pass the `login` and `password` keywords to either of   the example functions.A reminder: this repository does NOT redistribute FAIRsharing's data, it onlyprovides code for you to get it yourself.## üöÄ InstallationThe most recent release can be installed from[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fairsharing_client/) with:```bash$ pip install fairsharing_client```The most recent code and data can be installed directly from GitHub with:```bash$ pip install git+https://github.com/cthoyt/fairsharing-client.git```## üëê ContributingContributions, whether filing an issue, making a pull request, or forking, areappreciated. See[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cthoyt/fairsharing-client/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)for more information on getting involved.## üëã Attribution### ‚öñÔ∏è LicenseThe code in this package is licensed under the MIT License.### üç™ CookiecutterThis package was createdwith [@audreyfeldroy](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy)'s[cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) packageusing [@cthoyt](https://github.com/cthoyt)'s[cookiecutter-snekpack](https://github.com/cthoyt/cookiecutter-snekpack)template.## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers&lt;details&gt;  &lt;summary&gt;See developer instructions&lt;/summary&gt;The final section of the README is for if you want to get involved by making acode contribution.### Development InstallationTo install in development mode, use the following:```bash$ git clone git+https://github.com/cthoyt/fairsharing-client.git$ cd fairsharing-client$ pip install -e .```### ü•º TestingAfter cloning the repository and installing `tox` with `pip install tox`, theunit tests in the `tests/` folder can be run reproducibly with:```shell$ tox```Additionally, these tests are automatically re-run with each commit ina [GitHub Action](https://github.com/cthoyt/fairsharing-client/actions?query=workflow%3ATests).### üìñ Building the DocumentationThe documentation can be built locally using the following:```shell$ git clone git+https://github.com/cthoyt/fairsharing-client.git$ cd fairsharing-client$ tox -e docs$ open docs/build/html/index.html``` The documentation automatically installs the package as well as the `docs`extra specified in the [`setup.cfg`](setup.cfg). `sphinx` plugins like `texext`can be added there. Additionally, they need to be added to the`extensions` list in [`docs/source/conf.py`](docs/source/conf.py).### üì¶ Making a ReleaseAfter installing the package in development mode and installing`tox` with `pip install tox`, the commands for making a new release arecontained within the `finish` environment in `tox.ini`. Run the following fromthe shell:```shell$ tox -e finish```This script does the following:1. Uses [Bump2Version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version) to switch the   version number in the `setup.cfg`,   `src/fairsharing_client/version.py`,   and [`docs/source/conf.py`](docs/source/conf.py) to not have the `-dev`   suffix2. Packages the code in both a tar archive and a wheel   using [`build`](https://github.com/pypa/build)3. Uploads to PyPI using [`twine`](https://github.com/pypa/twine). Be sure to   have a `.pypirc` file configured to avoid the need for manual input at this   step4. Push to GitHub. You'll need to make a release going with the commit where the   version was bumped.5. Bump the version to the next patch. If you made big changes and want to bump   the version by minor, you can use `tox -e bumpversion minor` after.&lt;/details&gt;</longdescription>
