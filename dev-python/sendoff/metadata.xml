Modifying the metadata, or filtering/sorting basedon the metadata also can induce non-idempotent differences in the file based onopinionated approaches in chemical libraries.This library strives to be able to handle SDF files even with malformed chemistry ormetadata. Since much debugging of our files and data deals with such files, having accessto simple tools to interrogate the files while not modifying the file is crucial.This package also tried to document the &quot;canonical&quot; ways metadata is handled by the largerpackages. To wit, there are tests to monitor how, for example, rdkit deals with moleculesthat have multiline record values, or a &quot;$$$$&quot; molecule title.</longdescription>
