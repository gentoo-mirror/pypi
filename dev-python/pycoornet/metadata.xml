The rationale is that, while it may be common that several entities share the same URLs, it is unlikely, unless a consistent coordination exists, that this occurs within the time threshold and repeatedly.## Installation[https://pypi.org/project/pycoornet/](https://pypi.org/project/pycoornet/)```shpip install pycoornet```## Jupyter Notebook Example[pycoonet_example.ipynb](samples/pycoornet_example.ipynb)## Usage example```pythonfrom pycoornet.crowdtangle import CrowdTanglefrom pycoornet.shared import Sharedfrom pycoornet.statistics import Statisticsimport networkx as nximport numpy as npimport pandas as pdimport loggingdef main():    links_df = pd.read_csv('samples/sample_source_links.csv')    # Init CrowdTangle with api key    crowd_tangle = CrowdTangle(&quot;abc123def345&quot;)    ct_df = crowd_tangle.get_shares(urls=links_df, url_column='clean_url',                                    date_column='date',clean_urls=True,                                    platforms='facebook', max_calls = 2)    shared = Shared(ct_df)    crowtangle_shares_df, shares_graph, q, coordination_interval = shared.coord_shares(clean_urls=True)    print(f&quot;Coordination Time = {coordination_interval}&quot;)    #Build Gephi File    for node in shares_graph.nodes(data=True):        node[1]['label']=node[1]['account_name']    nx.write_gexf(shares_graph, &quot;samples/out/shares.gexf&quot;)    componet_summary_df = Statistics.component_summary(crowtangle_shares_df, shares_graph)    top_urls_df = Statistics.get_top_coord_urls(crowtangle_shares_df, shares_graph)if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, filename=&quot;pycoornet.log&quot;)    main()```## running tests```shpy.test --crowdtoken=&lt;your crowdtangle api token&gt;```For Example```shpy.test --crowdtoken=akZbRIg2DNKhFogkN6rFurv```## AcknowledgementsCooRnet has been developed as part of the project [Social Media Behaviour](https://upb-ss1.github.io/) research project activities.The project is supported by a the Social Media and Democracy Research Grants from Social Science Research Council (SSRC).
