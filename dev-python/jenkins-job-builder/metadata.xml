	<longdescription>README======Jenkins Job Builder takes simple descriptions of Jenkins_ jobs in YAML_ or JSON_format and uses them to configure Jenkins. You can keep your job descriptions inhuman readable text format in a version control system to make changes andauditing easier. It also has a flexible template system, so creating manysimilarly configured jobs is easy.To install::    $ pip install --user jenkins-job-builderOnline documentation:* https://jenkins-job-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Developers----------Bug report:* https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/723Repository:* https://opendev.org/jjb/jenkins-job-builderCloning::    git clone https://opendev.org/jjb/jenkins-job-builder.gitInstall pre-commit from https://pre-commit.com/#intro in order to run someminimal testing on your commits.A virtual environment is recommended for development.  For example, JenkinsJob Builder may be installed from the top level directory::    $ virtualenv .venv    $ source .venv/bin/activate    $ pip install -r test-requirements.txt -e .Patches are submitted via Gerrit at:* https://review.opendev.orgPlease do not submit GitHub pull requests, they will be automatically closed.Mailing list:* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkins-job-builderIRC:* ``#openstack-jjb`` on OFTCMore details on how you can contribute is available on our wiki at:* https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.htmlWriting a patch---------------We ask that all code submissions be pep8_ and pyflakes_ clean.  Theeasiest way to do that is to run tox_ before submitting code forreview in Gerrit.  It will run ``pep8`` and ``pyflakes`` in the samemanner as the automated test suite that will run on proposedpatchsets.When creating new YAML components, please observe the following styleconventions:* All YAML identifiers (including component names and arguments)  should be lower-case and multiple word identifiers should use  hyphens.  E.g., &quot;build-trigger&quot;.* The Python functions that implement components should have the same  name as the YAML keyword, but should use underscores instead of  hyphens. E.g., &quot;build_trigger&quot;.This consistency will help users avoid simple mistakes when writingYAML, as well as developers when matching YAML components to Pythonimplementation.Unit Tests----------Unit tests have been included and are in the ``tests`` folder. Many unittests samples are included as examples in our documentation to ensure thatexamples are kept current with existing behaviour. To run the unit tests,execute the command::    tox -e py38Unit tests could be run in parallel, using pytest-parallel pytest plugin::    tox -e py38 -- --workers=auto* Note: View ``tox.ini`` to run tests on other versions of Python,  generating the documentation and additionally for any special notes  on running the test to validate documentation external URLs from behind  proxies.Installing without setup.py---------------------------For YAML support, you will need libyaml_ installed.Mac OS X::    $ brew install libyamlThen install the required python packages using pip_::    $ sudo pip install PyYAML python-jenkins.. _Jenkins: https://jenkins.io/.. _YAML: https://yaml.org.. _JSON: http://json.org/.. _pep8: https://pypi.org/project/pep8.. _pyflakes: https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes.. _tox: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest.. _libyaml: https://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML.. _pip: https://pypi.org/project/pip</longdescription>
