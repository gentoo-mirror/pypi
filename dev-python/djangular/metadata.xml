	<longdescription>A reusable app that provides better app integration with AngularJS.  Djangular        allows you to create AngularJS content per app, instead of creating a single        massive AngularJS application inside of Django.  This allows you to selectively        use apps per site, as well as create a consistent structure across all of your        Django apps.                This is intended to be a Django version of the Angular-Seed project        (https://github.com/angular/angular-seed).  The current mindset is to limit the        amount of changes introduced by Djangular.</longdescription>
