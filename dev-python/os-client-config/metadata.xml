While  `os-client-config` will continue to exist, it is highly recommended that  users transition to using `openstacksdk`_ directly.`os-client-config` is a library for collecting client configuration forusing an OpenStack cloud in a consistent and comprehensive manner. Itwill find cloud config for as few as 1 cloud and as many as you want toput in a config file. It will read environment variables and config files,and it also contains some vendor specific default values so that you don'thave to know extra info to use OpenStack* If you have a config file, you will get the clouds listed in it* If you have environment variables, you will get a cloud named `envvars`* If you have neither, you will get a cloud named `defaults` with base defaultsSource------* Free software: Apache license* Documentation: http://docs.openstack.org/os-client-config/latest* Source: http://opendev.org/openstack/os-client-config* Bugs: https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/openstack/os-client-config* Release Notes https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/os-client-config.. _openstacksdk: http://docs.openstack.org/openstacksdk/latest</longdescription>
