	<longdescription># MPilotMPilot is a plugin-based, environmental modeling framework based on a bottom-up, many-to-many workflow that can be represented by a directed (not iterating) graph. MPilot is descended from the Environmental Evaluation Modeling System (EEMS), which was initially a fuzzy logic modeling package based on EMDS.[MPilot Documentation](https://consbio.github.io/mpilot/)# InstallingMPilot with EEMS can be installed with `pip`:```bash$ pip install mpilot```In order to run MPilot with NetCDF datasets, you'll need to install the NetCDF variant:```bash$ pip install mpilot[netcdf]```# Creating modelsMPilot models are contained in &quot;command files&quot;, using a simple scripting language. Here is an example model, which loads two columns of integer data from a CSV file, sums them, and writes the result to a second CSV file.```textA = EEMSRead(    InFileName = &quot;input.csv&quot;,    InFieldName = &quot;A&quot;,    DataType = &quot;Integer&quot;)B = EEMSRead(    InFileName = &quot;input.csv&quot;,    InFieldName = &quot;B&quot;,    DataType = &quot;Integer&quot;)APlusB = Sum(    InFieldNames = [A, B])Out = EEMSWrite(    OutFileName = &quot;output.csv&quot;,    OutFieldNames = [A, B, APlusB])```# Running modelsModels are run using the included `mpilot` program. The following commands will run a model using the EEMS CSV library and using the EEMS NetCDF library respectively:```bash$ mpilot eems-csv model.mpt$ mpilot eems-netcdf model.mpt```</longdescription>
