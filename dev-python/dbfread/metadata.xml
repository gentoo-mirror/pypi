	<longdescription>dbfread - Read DBF Files with Python====================================DBF is a file format used by databases such dBase, Visual FoxPro, andFoxBase+. This library reads DBF files and returns the data as nativePython data types for further processing. It is primarily intended forbatch jobs and one-off scripts.::    &gt;&gt;&gt; from dbfread import DBF    &gt;&gt;&gt; for record in DBF('people.dbf'):    ...     print(record)    OrderedDict([('NAME', 'Alice'), ('BIRTHDATE', datetime.date(1987, 3, 1))])    OrderedDict([('NAME', 'Bob'), ('BIRTHDATE', datetime.date(1980, 11, 12))])By default records are streamed directly from the file.  If you haveenough memory you can instead load them into a list. This allows forrandom access::    &gt;&gt;&gt; table = DBF('people.dbf', load=True)    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(table.records[1]['NAME'])    Bob    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(table.records[0]['NAME'])    AliceFull documentation at https://dbfread.readthedocs.io/See docs/changes.rst for a full list of changes in each version.Main Features-------------* written for Python 3, but also works in 2.7* simple but flexible API* data is returned as native Python data types* records are ordered dictionaries, but can be reconfigured to be of  any type* aims to handle all variants of DBF files. (Currently only widely  tested with Visual FoxPro, but should work well with other  variants.)* support for 18 field types. Custom types can be added by subclassing  ``FieldParser``* reads ``FPT`` and ``DBT`` memo files, both text and binary data* handles mixed case file names gracefully on case sensitive file systems* can retrieve deleted recordsInstalling----------Requires Python 3.2 or 2.7.::  pip install dbfread``dbfread`` is a pure Python module and doesn't depend on any packagesoutside the standard library.To build documentation locally::    python setup.py docsThis requires Sphinx. The resulting files can be found in``docs/_build/``.Source code------------Latest stable release: http://github.com/olemb/dbfread/Development version: http://github.com/olemb/dbfread/tree/develop/API Changes-----------``dbfread.open()`` and ``dbfread.read()`` are deprecated as of version``2.0``, and will be removed in ``2.2``.The ``DBF`` class is no longer a subclass of ``list``. This makes theAPI a lot cleaner and easier to understand, but old code that reliedon this behaviour will be broken. Iteration and record counting worksthe same as before. Other list operations can be rewritten using the``record`` attribute. For example::    table = dbfread.read('people.dbf')    print(table[1])can be rewritten as::    table = DBF('people.dbf', load=True)    print(table.records[1])``open()`` and ``read()`` both return ``DeprecatedDBF``, which is asubclass of ``DBF`` and ``list`` and thus backward compatible.License-------dbfread is released under the terms of the `MIT license&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License&gt;`_.Contact-------Ole Martin Bjorndalen - ombdalen@gmail.com</longdescription>
