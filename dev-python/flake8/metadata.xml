Multiple codes can be given, separated by comma. The ``noqa`` token is case insensitive, the colon before the list of codes is required otherwise the part after ``noqa`` is ignored- Git and Mercurial hooks- extendable through ``flake8.extension`` and ``flake8.formatting`` entry  pointsQuickstart==========See our `quickstart documentation&lt;https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html#quickstart&gt;`_ for how to installand get started with Flake8.Frequently Asked Questions==========================Flake8 maintains an `FAQ &lt;https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/faq.html&gt;`_ in itsdocumentation.Questions or Feedback=====================If you have questions you'd like to ask the developers, or feedback you'd liketo provide, feel free to use the mailing list: code-quality@python.orgWe would love to hear from you.
