It willattempt to be smart about not downloading data that'salready there, checking to make sure thatthere were no errors in fetching data, automatically unzipping the contentsof downloaded zipfiles (if desired), and displaying a progress bar withstatistics... note::    This draws heavily from the    `MNE-python &lt;https://martinos.org/mne&gt;`_ ``_fetch_file`` function._This package doesn't get a ton of developer attention, but is hopefully well-scopedenough that it should still be useful!
