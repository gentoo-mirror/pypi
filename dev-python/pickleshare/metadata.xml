	<longdescription>PickleShare - a small 'shelve' like datastore with concurrency supportLike shelve, a PickleShareDB object acts like a normal dictionary. Unlike shelve,many processes can access the database simultaneously. Changing a value in database is immediately visible to other processes accessing the same database.Concurrency is possible because the values are stored in separate files. Hencethe &quot;database&quot; is a directory where *all* files are governed by PickleShare.Example usage::    from pickleshare import *    db = PickleShareDB('~/testpickleshare')    db.clear()    print(&quot;Should be empty:&quot;,db.items())    db['hello'] = 15    db['aku ankka'] = [1,2,313]    db['paths/are/ok/key'] = [1,(5,46)]    print(db.keys())This module is certainly not ZODB, but can be used for low-load(non-mission-critical) situations where tiny code size trumps the advanced features of a &quot;real&quot; object database.Installation guide: pip install pickleshare</longdescription>
