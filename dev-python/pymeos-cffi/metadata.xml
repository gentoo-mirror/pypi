	<longdescription># PyMEOS CFFI![MEOS Logo](../doc/images/meos-logo.png)[MEOS (Mobility Engine, Open Source)](https://www.libmeos.org/) is a C library which enables the manipulation oftemporal and spatio-temporal data based on [MobilityDB](https://mobilitydb.com/)'s data types and functions.PyMEOS CFFI is a Python library that wraps the MEOS C library using CFFI, providing a set of python functionsthat allows to use all MEOS functionality while automatically taking care of conversions between basic Python and C types(such as Python's `str` to C's `char *`).  This library is not meant to be used directly by the user, since most of the functions receive or return C objects (CFFI's `cdata` type).  The [PyMEOS](../pymeos) library is built on top of this library and exposes all the functionalityof MEOS through a set of Python classes.# Usage## Installation````shellpip install pymeos-cffi````## Source installationIf the pre-built distribution is not available for your system, `pip` will try to make source distribution. For that, you will need to make sure you have the following requirements:- C compiler- [MEOS Library](https://www.libmeos.org/)If the installation fails, you can submit an issue in the [PyMEOS issue tracker](https://github.com/MobilityDB/PyMEOS/issues)</longdescription>
