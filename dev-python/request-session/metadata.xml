	<longdescription># request-session[![Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/request-session)](https://pypi.org/project/request-session/)[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)**`request-session`** is an HTTP library built on top of [`requests`](https://requests.kennethreitz.org/en/master/)that makes your live easier by retrying whenever a request fails,logs the results or even sends metrics and traces to DataDogHQ.**RequestSession** also measures the time of the request.Use **`RequestSession`** to create a client module for accessing a group of resourcesserved on a common endpoint with default values valid for all ormost of the calls you need to make. For your convenience,some defaults are already provided.## UsageTo install `request-session`, use pip:```bashpip install request-session``````pythonfrom request_session import RequestSessionclient = RequestSession(    host=&quot;https://jobs.kiwi.com&quot;,    max_retries=4,          # how many times to retry in case server error occurs    raise_for_status=True,  # raise an exception if failed on every attempt)response = client.get(    path=&quot;/&quot;,    sleep_before_repeat=1,      # how many seconds to wait untill next try      request_category=&quot;jobs&quot;,    # what to log to stdout/stderr)```## Benefits of using `RequestSession`* **Retry**: It is possible to configure a retry in case of request failure.* **Logs**: Result of the request can also be logged to `stdout`.* **Metrics**: On each call you make to `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and`DELETE` methods, several metrics are sent to your datadog client -duration of the request, how many requests were sent,outcome of the request (a DataDog integration is needed).* **Tracing**: `RequestSession` can send tracing info to DataDog(an APM integration is needed).You can find more details about `RequestSession`'s benefits and examples in[the official documentation](https://kiwicom.github.io/request-session/).## How to run testTo run all tests you just need to run the command `tox`.&gt; Note that tox doesn't know when you change the `requirements.txt`&gt; and won't automatically install new dependencies for test runs.&gt; Run `pip install tox-battery` to install a plugin which fixes this silliness.</longdescription>
