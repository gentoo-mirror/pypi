	<longdescription>Tensor2Tensor, or T2T for short, is a library of deep learning models and datasets designed to make deep learning more accessible and accelerate ML research. T2T was developed by researchers and engineers in the Google Brain team and a community of users. It is now in maintenance mode -- we keep it running and welcome bug-fixes, but encourage users to use the successor library Trax.</longdescription>
