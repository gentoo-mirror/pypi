	<longdescription>This package provides an implementation of the Secure Remote Passwordprotocol (SRP). SRP is a cryptographically strong authenticationprotocol for password-based, mutual authentication over an insecurenetwork connection.Unlike other common challenge-response autentication protocols, suchas Kerberos and SSL, SRP does not rely on an external infrastructureof trusted key servers or certificate management. Instead, SRP serverapplications use verification keys derived from each user's passwordto determine the authenticity of a network connection.SRP provides mutual-authentication in that successful authenticationrequires both sides of the connection to have knowledge of theuser's password. If the client side lacks the user's password or theserver side lacks the proper verification key, the authentication willfail.Unlike SSL, SRP does not directly encrypt all data flowing throughthe authenticated connection. However, successful authentication doesresult in a cryptographically strong shared key that can be usedfor symmetric-key encryption.For a full description of the pysrp package and the SRP protocol,please refer to the `srp module documentation`_... _`srp module documentation`: http://packages.python.org/srp</longdescription>
