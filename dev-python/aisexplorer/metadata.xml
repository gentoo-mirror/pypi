	<longdescription># AISExplorer  ![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/AISExplorer)![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/AISExplorer)![example workflow](https://github.com/reyemb/AISExplorer/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg?style=for-the-badge)AISExplorer is a tool for locating vessels or scraping vessel data in a specific area. However, due to recent updates, the use of free proxies, previously scraped from sources like [sslproxies](https://www.sslproxies.org/), has been discontinued due to errors such as 403 Forbidden responses.## Next Steps- Explore additional sources for proxy lists.- Implement a method to customize the number of retries.- Introduce functionality to reset filters.## Changelog### 2023-11-10  - Due to Captcha implementation, login functionality is broken.  - Sending requests through proxies now leads to a 403 error; proxy support has been removed.### 2023-1-21- Integrated login functions for additional features.### 2021-12-10- Implemented fallback if a proxy fails.- Introduced the ability to retrieve data directly via URL.- Added checks for Cloudflare's filtering mechanisms.### 2021-12-5- Early stages of filter implementation.- Retry options were added for resilience.- New exceptions were introduced for better error handling.### 2021-11-27- Proxy support was added (discontinued as of 2023-11-10).## Installation``` cmdpip install aisexplorer```## Usage### Find vessel by MMISRetrieve the current location of a vessel using its MMSI identifier.```pythonfrom aisexplorer.AIS import AISAIS().get_location(211281610)```### Find vessels in AreaRetrieve data for up to 500 vessels within a designated area.**maximum 500 vessels**```pythonfrom aisexplorer.AIS import AISAIS(return_df= True).get_area_data(&quot;EMED&quot;)```The output is limited to 500 rows. Area codes can be referenced from the MarineTraffic help section.[Areas](https://help.marinetraffic.com/hc/en-us/articles/214556408-Areas-of-the-World-How-does-MarineTraffic-segment-them-) can be found here### Get Table via URLDirectly access table data using a MarineTraffic URL.```pythonfrom aisexplorer.AIS import AISAIS(return_df = True).get_data_by_url(&quot;https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/data/?asset_type=vessels&amp;columns=time_of_latest_position:desc,flag,shipname,photo,recognized_next_port,reported_eta,reported_destination,current_port,imo,ship_type,show_on_live_map,area,lat_of_latest_position,lon_of_latest_position,speed,length,width&amp;area_in|in|West%20Mediterranean,East%20Mediterranean|area_in=WMED,EMED&amp;time_of_latest_position_between|gte|time_of_latest_position_between=60,NaN&quot;)```### Use ProxiesPreviously, AISExplorer allowed fetching data using proxies for anonymization. This feature is no longer supported due to compatibility issues with the data source.### Get Data for user created fleetsNo longer available as it required user login, which is now deprecated due to captcha implementation.</longdescription>
