	<longdescription># sphinx_lfs_content[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/sphinx-lfs-content.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/sphinx-lfs-content)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/sphinx-lfs-content/badge/?version=latest)](https://sphinx-lfs-content.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)Git LFS is a popular method to store large files like e.g. documentation assets in git repositories.Building such documentation on a system without Git LFS will typically result in broken documentation. `sphinx_lfs_content` is a minimalistic Sphinx extension that ensures that `git-lfs` is installed and otherwise installs it and fetches LFS content.It is motivated by the [lack of LFS support on readthedocs.org](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/1846).## InstallationThe extension can be installed from PyPI using `pip`:```pythonpython -m pip install sphinx_lfs_content```If you use a requirements file to describe the dependencies of your documentation build, simply add `sphinx_lfs_content` to it.## How to use itAdd the following lines to your `conf.py`:```python# The list of enabled extensionsextensions = [    &quot;sphinx_lfs_content&quot;,]```That's all. The extension will check whether the system has `git-lfs` and download a versionfrom the [`git-lfs` GitHub page](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs), verify its checksumand checkout any LFS content.Additionally, a configuration value `lfs_content_post_commands` is available. It accepts a listof strings with commands that will be executed after the git-lfs checkout was performed.This can be used to resolve chicken-egg situations with other setup code.## RestrictionsThe extension is very likely to only work on Linux right now, as it does not properly select the `git-lfs` archive to download.</longdescription>
