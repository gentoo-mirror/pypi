	<longdescription>osgeo package===============A dummy placeholder for the `gdal` packageIn order to be able to run `from osgeo import gdal`, You were probably trying to install `gdal` by running `pip install osgeo`.Instead, you should either `pip install gdal` or replace `osgeo` with `gdal` in your requirements.This package was made so an attacker would not be able to take advantage of this confusion.</longdescription>
