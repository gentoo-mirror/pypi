There are places where thesewill conflict, and the goal is to make the library intuitive both to thosefamiliar with the XML schemas (but less familiar with Python) and also toexperienced Python developers who want to add MAEC support to their programs.There are currently two levels of APIs for dealing with MAEC content:- A low-level API is provided by auto-generated XML Schema - Python class  bindings. These bindings were generated using `generateDS  &lt;http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/generateDS.html&gt;`_. With these, any MAEC  content can be parsed from or written to XML, but requires a bit more  knowledge of the actual MAEC schemas. These &quot;binding classes&quot; are all located  in the ``maec.bindings`` package.- A higher-level API consisting of manually designed Python classes.  These  &quot;native classes&quot; are intended to behave more like Python programmers would  expect. As they are designed manually, they currently do not support the  entire MAEC standard, but rather those object types we expect are used most  frequently. These &quot;native classes&quot; also support exporting their content as  Python dictionaries and lists, which can easily be converted to JSON.  Importing from JSON is also supported.Compatibility-------------The python-maec library is tested against Python 2.7 and 3.4+.Versioning----------Releases of the python-maec library will be given version numbers of the form``major.minor.update.revision``, where ``major``, ``minor``, and ``update``correspond to the MAEC version being supported. The ``revision`` number is usedto indicate new versions of the python-maec library itself.Installation------------The python-maec library can be installed via the distutils setup.py scriptincluded at the root directory:    $ python setup.py installThe python-maec library is also hosted on `PyPI&lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/maec/&gt;`_ and can be installed with `pip&lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip&gt;`_:    $ pip install maecDependencies------------The ``maec`` package depends on the following Python libraries:* ``lxml``* ``python-cybox``* ``setuptools`` (only if installing using setup.py)For Windows installers of the above libraries, we recommend looking here:http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs. python-cybox can be found athttps://github.com/CybOXProject/python-cybox/releases.To build ``lxml`` on Ubuntu, you will need the following packages from theUbuntu package repository:* python-dev* libxml2-dev* libxslt1-dev* zlib1g-devFor more information about installing lxml, seehttp://lxml.de/installation.html.Feedback--------Bug reports and feature requests are welcome and encouraged. Pull requests areespecially appreciated. Feel free to use the issue tracker on GitHub, join the `MAEC Community Email Discussion List &lt;https://maec.mitre.org/community/discussionlist.html&gt;`_, or send an email directly to maec@mitre.org.</longdescription>
