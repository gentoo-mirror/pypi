It allows the developers to build their own distributed and cross-languige program easily. The protocol is config-less and extremly easy to use. Currently, [Msgpack](https://msgpack.org) is used for binary serialization. InteractionFree implementation is already available in various languages (including Scala, Javascript, Arduino). More infomation will be available soon.- InteractionFree specification: to be drafted.## Quick Start **Install**```shell$ pip install interactionfreepy```**Start the server**```pythonfrom interactionfreepy import IFBrokerbroker = IFBroker('tcp://*:port')IFLoop.join()```replace `port` to any port number that is available.`IFLoop.join()` is a utility function to prevent the program from finishing.**Start a worker**```pythonfrom interactionfreepy import IFWorkerclass Target():    def tick(self, message):        return &quot;tack %s&quot; % messageworker = IFWorker('tcp://address:port', 'TargetService', Target())IFLoop.join()```replace `address` and `port` to the server's net address and port.**Start a client**```pythonfrom interactionfreepy import IFWorkerclient = IFWorker('tcp://address:port')print(client.TargetService.tick('now'))```</longdescription>
