	<longdescription>Dask CUDA=========Various utilities to improve deployment and management of Dask workers onCUDA-enabled systems.This library is experimental, and its API is subject to change at any timewithout notice.Example-------```pythonfrom dask_cuda import LocalCUDAClusterfrom dask.distributed import Clientcluster = LocalCUDACluster()client = Client(cluster)```Documentation is available [here](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/dask-cuda/nightly/).What this is not----------------This library does not automatically convert your Dask code to run on GPUs.It only helps with deployment and management of Dask workers in multi-GPUsystems.  Parallelizing GPU libraries like [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai) and[CuPy](https://cupy.chainer.org) with Dask is an ongoing effort.  You may wishto read about this effort at [blog.dask.org](https://blog.dask.org) for moreinformation.  Additional information about Dask-CUDA can also be found in the[docs](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/dask-cuda/nightly/).</longdescription>
