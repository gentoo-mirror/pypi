	<longdescription># bavard-nlu## Local Development### Install Dependencies```pip3 install -e .pip3 install -r requirements-test.txt```### Testing LocallyThe tests for this repo consist of functional tests for catching bugs/code regressions, validation tests for catching model performance regressions, and integration tests for testing the NLU docker containers and their interactions. The validation and integration tests take much longer to execute. All are run in CI. To run the tests locally:```./test/scripts/lint-and-test.sh &lt;test_suite&gt;```Where `&lt;test_suite` denotes the type of tests to run, and allows these options:- `functional` - Runs just the functional tests.- `integration` (default) - Runs both the functional and integration tests.- `all` - Runs the functional, integration, and validation tests.To run both the functional and integration tests:### The Package CLIThere is a convenience CLI for training, evaluating, predicting, tuning, and interacting with NLU and dialogue policy models. To see the CLI documentation:```python3 -m bavard --help```You can also view the documentation for a sub-command for example:```python3 -m bavard nlu evaluate  --help```## Releasing The PackageReleasing the package is automatically handled by CI, but three steps must be taken to trigger a successful release:1. Increment the `VERSION` variable in `setup.py` to the new desired version (e.g. `VERSION=&quot;1.1.1&quot;`)2. Commit and tag the repo with the **exact same** value you populated the `VERSION` variable with (e.g. `git tag 1.1.1`)3. Push the commit and tag to remote. These can be done together using: `git push --atomic origin &lt;branch name&gt; &lt;tag&gt;`CI will then release the package to pypi with that version once the commit and tag are pushed.</longdescription>
