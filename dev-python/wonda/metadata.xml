All batteries are included: there are [text formatting], [file uploading], [blueprints], [middleware] and [FSM].## Flavors### RegularTo install regular version of Wonda, enter this command in your terminal:```shell scriptpip install -U wonda```If you decide to go beta, use the same command with `--pre` option or update from dev branch .zip [archive](https://github.com/wondergram-org/wonda/archive/refs/heads/dev.zip).### PerformanceWonda is built with customizations in mind, so you can squeeze out the most speed from it. To do so, install it with some extras:```shell scriptpip install --force wonda[power-ups]```To see the full list of extra packages, refer to our [project file](pyproject.toml).## GuideIt's easy to build a bot with Wonda — it's ready in *six* lines of code. Extending it is no problem too.```pythonfrom wonda import Botbot = Bot(&quot;your-token&quot;)@bot.on.message()async def handler(_) -&gt; str:    return &quot;Hello world!&quot;bot.run_forever()```With Wonda, it's possible to achieve this much with so little code. To get started, check out our [examples].## ContributingWonda is a work in progress and a lot of stuff is expected to change!
