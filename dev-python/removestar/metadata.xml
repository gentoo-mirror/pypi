For external library imports, including imports of standardlibrary modules, it dynamically imports the module to determine the names.This can be disabled with the `--no-dynamic-importing` flag.See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/asmeurer/removestar/issues). Pullrequests are welcome.## Installation```pip install removestar```or if you use conda```conda install -c conda-forge removestar```## Usage```$ removestar file.py # Shows diff but does not edit file.py$ removestar -i file.py # Edits file.py in-place$ removestar -i module/ # Modifies every Python file in module/ recursively```## Why is `import *` so bad?Doing `from module import *` is generally frowned upon in Python. It isconsidered acceptable when working interactively at a `python` prompt, or in`__init__.py` files (removestar skips `__init__.py` files by default).Some reasons why `import *` is bad:- It hides which names are actually imported.- It is difficult both for human readers and static analyzers such as  pyflakes to tell where a given name comes from when `import *` is used. For  example, pyflakes cannot detect unused names (for instance, from typos) in  the presence of `import *`.- If there are multiple `import *` statements, it may not be clear which names  come from which module. In some cases, both modules may have a given name,  but only the second import will end up being used. This can break people's  intuition that the order of imports in a Python file generally does not  matter.- `import *` often imports more names than you would expect. Unless the module  you import defines `__all__` or carefully `del`s unused names at the module  level, `import *` will import every public (doesn't start with an  underscore) name defined in the module file. This can often include things  like standard library imports or loop variables defined at the top-level of  the file. For imports from modules (from `__init__.py`), `from module import  *` will include every submodule defined in that module. Using `__all__` in  modules and `__init__.py` files is also good practice, as these things are  also often confusing even for interactive use where `import *` is  acceptable.- In Python 3, `import *` is syntactically not allowed inside of a function.Here are some official Python references stating not to use `import *` infiles:- [The official Python  FAQ](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html?highlight=faq#what-are-the-best-practices-for-using-import-in-a-module):  &gt; In general, don’t use `from modulename import *`. Doing so clutters the  &gt; importer’s namespace, and makes it much harder for linters to detect  &gt; undefined names.- [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports) (the official  Python style guide):  &gt; Wildcard imports (`from &lt;module&gt; import *`) should be avoided, as they  &gt; make it unclear which names are present in the namespace, confusing both  &gt; readers and many automated tools.Unfortunately, if you come across a file in the wild that uses `import *`, itcan be hard to fix it, because you need to find every name in the file that isimported from the `*`. Removestar makes this easy by finding which names comefrom `*` imports and replacing the import lines in the file automatically.## ExampleSuppose you have a module `mymod` like```mymod/  | __init__.py  | a.py  | b.py```With```py# mymod/a.pyfrom .b import *def func(x):    return x + y``````py# mymod/b.pyx = 1y = 2```Then `removestar` works like:```$ removestar mymod/--- original/mymod/a.py+++ fixed/mymod/a.py@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@ # mymod/a.py-from .b import *+from .b import y def func(x):     return x + y```This does not edit `a.py` by default. The `-i` flag causes it to edit `a.py` in-place:```$ removestar -i mymod/$ cat mymod/a.py# mymod/a.pyfrom .b import ydef func(x):    return x + y```## Command line options&lt;!-- TODO: Autogenerate this somehow --&gt;```$ removestar --helpusage: removestar [-h] [-i] [--version] [--no-skip-init]                  [--no-dynamic-importing] [-v] [-q]                  [--max-line-length MAX_LINE_LENGTH]                  PATH [PATH ...]Tool to automatically replace &quot;import *&quot; imports with explicit importsRequires pyflakes.Usage:$ removestar file.py # Shows diff but does not edit file.py$ removestar -i file.py # Edits file.py in-place$ removestar -i module/ # Modifies every Python file in module/ recursivelypositional arguments:  PATH                  Files or directories to fixoptional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -i, --in-place        Edit the files in-place.

This is required for star imports from                        external modules and modules in the standard library.

Set to 0 to disable line wrapping.                        (default: 100)```## Whitelisting star imports`removestar` does not replace star import lines that are marked with[Flake8 `noqa` comments][noqa-comments] that permit star imports (`F401` or`F403`).[noqa-comments]: https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/3.1.1/user/ignoring-errors.html#in-line-ignoring-errorsFor example, the star imports in this module would be kept:```pyfrom os import *  # noqa: F401from .b import *  # noqadef func(x):    return x + y```## ChangelogSee the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file.## License[MIT](LICENSE)</longdescription>
