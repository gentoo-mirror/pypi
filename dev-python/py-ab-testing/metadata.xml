It doesn't require any complex backend or database. Supporting both Javascript and Python.The AB Testing library segmentating users under different &quot;[cohorts](#terms)&quot;, so you could use an `if-else`-like statement to implement different features base on the segmentation.There're 2 ways of segmentation:1. Percentage based segmentation: Randomly allocate certain percent of user to a &quot;[cohort](#terms)&quot;. The allocation algorithm guarantees to produce stable results within a single [experiment](#terms), and produce a different set of users for another [experiment](#terms) in a random way. You can also further filter the user set using the key `allocation_criteria`. Take a look at this example: `first 25% users`, it will always result into the same group of users in [experiment](#terms) `A`, but results in another completely different group of users for [experiment](#terms) `B`.2. User profile based segmentation: Manually assign a specific group of users to a cohort. This can be used to achieve features like &quot;expose a new feature to the company emplyees for internal testing&quot;. Note the profile based segmentation works independently from the percentage based method. They doesn't interfere each other.The segmentation decisions are made base on a configuration file. The file should be `json` formated and hosted centralized place. More details about the configuration file below.The config file can be optionaly [hashed](#Configuration-File-Hashing-and-Protecting-private-information) so the content is not reversable. In this case you can host the file publicly, for example, on you CDN server, or in a publich S3 bucket.# Terms**Experiment**: A subject that you want to do ab-testing with. You can have multiple experiments on going at the same time, the library can handle them independently.**Cohort**: Inside an experiment, users are classified into groups. The groups are called Cohorts.**`control`**: The name of the default cohort. Which is, the cohort returned when the user doesn't matche any rule on any cohorts, or the experiment just doesn't exists.# Package API References## For React: `@appannie/react-ab-testing`[![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@appannie/react-ab-testing)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@appannie/react-ab-testing)[![npm bundle size (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/min/@appannie/react-ab-testing)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@appannie/react-ab-testing)[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/@appannie/react-ab-testing)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@appannie/react-ab-testing)React binding for the vanilla Javascript package, featuring similar functionality.### Installation```shnpm install @appannie/react-ab-testing# oryarn add @appannie/react-ab-testing```### UsageWrap your app with the `ABTestingController````jsimport { ABTestingController } from '@appannie/react-ab-testing';const MyApp = ({ user }) =&gt; {    const profile = {        persona: user.persona,        employee: user.isEmployee,    };    return (        &lt;ABTestingController config={testConfig} userId={user.id} userProfile={profile}&gt;            &lt;App /&gt;        &lt;/ABTestingController&gt;    );};```The required props are:1. `config`: the configuration object.2. `userId`: a unique identifier for your current user. This ID should be the same across visits to make sure your user always end up in the same cohorts. It can a `string` or a `number`.3. `userProfile`: a key/value map used to force include a user in given cohorts.Then within your app, check the cohort a user is assigned to using the `useCohortOf` hook.```jsimport { useCohortOf } from '@appannie/react-ab-testing';const Component = () =&gt; {    const cohort = useCohortOf('experiment-name');    switch (cohort) {        case 'blue':            return &lt;BlueButton /&gt;;        case 'red':            return &lt;RedButton /&gt;;        // 'control' is the default cohort.

The allocation config                    // represents the slice of users allocated to a cohort. You can have multiple                    // allocation ranges.                    // Every range needs to be unique and not overlap other ranges in any other cohort.                    allocation: [                        [0, 25]                    ],                    // The allocation_criteria key allows us to further filter the set of users by enforcing                     // a criteria that must be valid before the cohort is approved.

We have an automated CI task to encode/encrypt and push the final configuration to a public S3 bucket from where our SDK retrieve the configuration.## Configuration File Hashing and Protecting private informationYou shouldn't list user [private information (PII)](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/PII) within the configuration file as these are most likely public.If you need to segment users using emails or information you wish/need to keep private, we suggest you to securely encrypt them.We're providing an extra module `@appannie/ab-testing-hash-object` aiming to simplify this flow. This module will encode the keys and the values of your user profile. You then need to call it with the same `salt` while preprocessing your configuration and once when defining the user profile:```jsimport { hashObject } from '@appannie/ab-testing-hash-object';const profile = hashObject(    {        persona: user.persona,        employee: user.isEmployee,    },    config.salt);```## Example configuration and common use case### Excluding a user from an experimentYou can do this by force including a user or a group of users in the `control` cohort.```yamlexperiments:    - name: my_experiment      cohorts:          - name: control            force_include:                # Here we'd prevent any google.com users from seeing the experiment                email_domain:                    - google.com          - name: cohort_A            allocation:                - [0, 10]```### Internal whitelistForce include users with `email_domain` equal to `appannie.com` under the desired cohort.```yamlexperiments:    - name: my_experiment      cohorts:          - name: control          - name: cohort_A            force_include:                # Force all Data AI user under the given cohort                email_domain:                    - appannie.com```# CreditsMade with ❤️ by [Zhang Tao](https://github.com/ZigZagT) and [Simon Boudrias](https://github.com/SBoudrias) from the Data AI Beijing office.Available for public use under the MIT license.</longdescription>
