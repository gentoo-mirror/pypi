The vast majority of the work here was from folks at Yelp and other contributors (see Authors.txt). This package was based off an initial clone of the `gearman` package, tag `v2.0.2`. Python3-compatible fixes to core classes and functions were brought in from https://github.com/msjaiswal/python3-gearman. In addition, python3 updates to the unit tests were also included. Moreover, TravisCI functionality was brought in to automatebuilding and testing.
