It was designed to provides a compact datarepresentation without sacrificing variant access performance.This python package is a wrapper around the [bgen library](https://github.com/limix/bgen),a low-memory footprint reader that efficiently reads bgen files.It fully supports the bgen format specifications: 1.2 and 1.3;as well as their optional compressed formats.## InstallIt can be installed via [conda](https://conda.io/docs/)```bashconda install -c conda-forge bgen-reader```Or via pip```bashpip install bgen-reader```## DocumentationPlease, refer to [https://bgen-reader.readthedocs.io](https://bgen-reader.readthedocs.io).## Troubleshooting### fatal error: bgen.h: No such file or directoryThis means that bgen C library is not installed (or could not be found).
