	<longdescription># bfg9000 - build file generator**bfg9000** is a cross-platform *build configuration system* with an emphasis onmaking it easy to define how to build your software. It converts a Python-basedbuild script into the appropriate files for your underlying build system ofchoice (Ninja, Make, or MSBuild).## Why bfg9000?#### Familiar syntax`build.bfg` files are just Python scripts with some new functions added, so youmay already know how to write them; and when your build gets complicated, youcan rely on the existing Python ecosystem to get you out of trouble.#### Fast buildsbfg9000 ensures your builds are fast by relying on existing, mature buildsystems like Make and Ninja to do the heavy lifting of building your software;often, incremental builds don't need to execute bfg9000 at all!#### Stay saneBuilding your code shouldn't be the hard part of developing your project. Aboveall else, bfg9000 strives to help you get your build right the *first* time withmany helpful [features][features].## A brief exampleYou can't get much simpler than the simplest `build.bfg` file:```pythonexecutable('simple', files=['simple.cpp'])```To build this executable, we need to create the actual build files and thenrun them:```sh$ cd /path/to/src/$ 9k build/$ cd build/$ ninja```From there, you can run your newly-created executable: `./simple`. Hooray!For further examples, please see the [`examples/`][examples] subdirectory.## Installationbfg9000 uses [setuptools][setuptools], so installation is much the same as anyother Python package:```sh$ pip install bfg9000```From there, you can start using bfg to build your software! (If you're usingUbuntu, you can also install bfg9000 from the following PPA:[ppa:jimporter/stable][ppa]). For more information about how to install bfg9000,see the [documentation][getting-started].## LicenseThis project is licensed under the [BSD 3-clause license](LICENSE).[pypi-image]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/bfg9000.svg[pypi-link]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bfg9000[documentation-image]: https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-bfg9000-blue.svg[documentation-link]: https://jimporter.github.io/bfg9000/[gh-actions-image]: https://github.com/jimporter/bfg9000/workflows/build/badge.svg[gh-actions-link]: https://github.com/jimporter/bfg9000/actions?query=branch%3Amaster+workflow%3Abuild[appveyor-image]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/hxvbggf6exq8i2k6/branch/master?svg=true[appveyor-link]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jimporter/bfg9000/branch/master[codecov-image]: https://codecov.io/gh/jimporter/bfg9000/branch/master/graph/badge.svg[codecov-link]: https://codecov.io/gh/jimporter/bfg9000[features]: https://jimporter.github.io/bfg9000/latest/user/features[examples]: https://github.com/jimporter/bfg9000/tree/master/examples[setuptools]: https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/[ppa]: https://launchpad.net/~jimporter/+archive/ubuntu/stable[getting-started]: https://jimporter.github.io/bfg9000/latest/getting-started</longdescription>
