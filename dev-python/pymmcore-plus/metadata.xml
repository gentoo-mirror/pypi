See  [CMMCorePlus  documentation](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/pymmcore-plus/api/cmmcoreplus/)  for details.- `CMMCorePlus` includes a `run_mda` method (name may change) &quot;acquisition  engine&quot; that drives micro-manager for conventional multi-dimensional  experiments. It accepts an  [MDASequence](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/useq-schema/schema/sequence/)  from [useq-schema](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/useq-schema/) for  experiment design/declaration.- Adds a [callback  system](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/pymmcore-plus/api/events/) that adapts  the CMMCore callback object to an existing python event loop (such as Qt, or  perhaps asyncio/etc...).  The `CMMCorePlus` class also fixes a number of  &quot;missed&quot; events that are not currently emitted by the CMMCore API.## Documentationhttps://pymmcore-plus.github.io/pymmcore-plus/## Why not just use `pymmcore` directly?[pymmcore](https://github.com/micro-manager/pymmcore) is (and should probablyremain) a thin SWIG wrapper for the C++ code at the core of the[Micro-Manager](https://github.com/micro-manager/mmCoreAndDevices/) project.  Itis sufficient to control micromanager via python, but lacks some &quot;niceties&quot; thatpython users are accustomed to. This library:- extends the `pymmcore.CMMCore` object with [additional  methods](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/pymmcore-plus/api/cmmcoreplus/)- fixes emission of a number of events in `MMCore`.- provide proper python interfaces for various objects like  [`Configuration`](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/pymmcore-plus/api/configuration/)  and [`Metadata`](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/pymmcore-plus/api/metadata/).- provides an [object-oriented  API](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/pymmcore-plus/api/device/) for Devices  and their properties.- uses more interpretable `Enums` rather than `int` for [various  constants](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/pymmcore-plus/api/constants/)- improves docstrings and type annotations.- generally feel more pythonic (note however, `camelCase` method names from the  CMMCore API are *not* substituted with `snake_case`).## What about `Pycro-Manager`?[Pycro-Manager](https://github.com/micro-manager/pycro-manager) is a librarydesigned to make it easier to work with and control the **Java** Micro-managerapplication using python.  As such, it requires Java to be installed and runningin the background (either via the micro-manager GUI application directly, or viaa headless process).  The python half communicates with the Java half usingZeroMQ messaging.**In brief**: while `Pycro-Manager` provides a python API to control the JavaMicro-manager application (which in turn controls the C++ core), `pymmcore-plus`provides a python API to control the C++ core directly, without the need forJava in the loop.## Quickstart### Install```sh# from pippip install pymmcore-plus# from condaconda install -c conda-forge pymmcore-plus# if you also want the experimental inter-process RemoteCMMCore featurepip install pymmcore-plus[remote]# or from source treepip install git+https://github.com/pymmcore-plus/pymmcore-plus.git```Usually, you'll then want to install the device adapters (thoughyou can also download these manually from [micro-manager.org](https://micro-manager.org/Micro-Manager_Nightly_Builds)):```shmmcore install```*See [installation documentation ](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/pymmcore-plus/install/) for more details.*### UsageThen use the core object as you would `pymmcore.CMMCore`...but with [more features](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/pymmcore-plus/api/cmmcoreplus/) :smile:```pythonfrom pymmcore_plus import CMMCorePluscore = CMMCorePlus()...```### ExamplesSee a number of [usage examples in thedocumentation](http://pymmcore-plus.github.io/pymmcore-plus/examples/mda/).You can find some basic python scripts in the [examples](examples) directory ofthis repository## ContributingContributions are welcome!
