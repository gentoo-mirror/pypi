	<longdescription>Visvis is a pure Python library for visualization of 1D to 4D data in anobject oriented way. Essentially, visvis is an object oriented layer ofPython on top of OpenGl, thereby combining the power of OpenGl with theusability of Python. A Matlab-like interface in the form of a set offunctions allows easy creation of objects (e.g. plot(), imshow(), volshow(),surf()).With visvis a range of different data can be visualized by simply addingworld objects to a scene (or axes). These world objects can be anythingfrom plots (lines with markers), to images, 3D rendered volumes,shaded meshes, or you can program your own world object class. If required,these data can also be moved in time.Visvis can be used in Python scripts, interactive Python sessions (aswith IPython or IEP) and can be embedded in applications.Requirements:  * Numpy  * PyOpengl  * A backend GUI toolkit (PySide, PyQt4, PyQt5, wxPython, GTK, fltk)  * (optionally, to enable reading and writing of images) imageiousage:import visvis as vvAll wobjects, wibjects and functions are present in the visvisnamespace. For clean lists, see vv.wibjects, vv.wobjects, or vv.functions,respectively.For more help, see ...  * the docstrings  * the examples in the examples dir  * the examples at the bottom of the function modules (in the functions dir)  * the online docs: https://github.com/almarklein/visvis/wikiVisvis is maintained by Almar Klein.</longdescription>
