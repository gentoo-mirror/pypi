	<longdescription>pyIGES======Python IGES reader with basic functionality to read an IGES file andconvert some entities to a ``pyvista`` or ``vtk`` mesh.This module can read in and perform basic parsing of all entities andcan perform additional parsing and geometry visualization of thefollowing entities:- Vertex List (Type 502 Form 1)- Edge List- Loop (for specifying a bounded face for BREP geometries- Face- Circular arc- Rational B-Spline Surface- Rational B-Spline Curve- Conic Arc (Type 104)- Line- PointInstallation------------``pyiges`` is offered in a &quot;full&quot; variant including the conversion featuresand a &quot;pure&quot; parsing module variant.The pure variant has no conversion features, no dependencies to ``pyvista,geomdl``,and can be installed by removing the ``[full]`` specificator from the following commands.Install with pip using:.. code::   pip install pyiges[full]Otherwise, if you want the bleeding edge version, feel free to clonethis repo and install with:.. code:: bash   git clone https://github.com/pyvista/pyiges   cd pyiges   pip install .[full]Note that the square brackets might need to be escaped or quoted when using ``zsh``.Usage-----The ``pyiges`` module can read in many entities as raw text, but onlyNURBS surfaces and bsplines can be converted to ``pyvista`` meshes... code:: python    import pyiges    from pyiges import examples    # load an example impeller    iges = pyiges.read(examples.impeller)    # print an invidiual entity (boring)    print(iges[0])    # convert all lines to a vtk mesh and plot it    lines = iges.to_vtk(bsplines=True, surfaces=False, merge=True)    lines.plot(color='w', line_width=2)    # convert all surfaces to a vtk mesh and plot it    mesh = iges.to_vtk(bsplines=False, surfaces=True, merge=True, delta=0.05)    mesh.plot(color='w', smooth_shading=True)    # control resolution of the mesh by changing &quot;delta&quot;    # save this surface to file    mesh.save('mesh.ply')  # as ply    mesh.save('mesh.stl')  # as stl    mesh.save('mesh.vtk')  # as vtkLines~~~~~.. image:: https://github.com/pyvista/pyiges/raw/main/docs/images/impeller_lines.pngSurfaces~~~~~~~~.. image:: https://github.com/pyvista/pyiges/raw/main/docs/images/impeller_surf.pngAcknowledgments---------------Substantial code was obtained from or inspired by https://github.com/cfinch/IGES-File-ReaderIGES reference definitions were obtained from `Eclipse IGES Wiki &lt;https://wiki.eclipse.org/IGES_file_Specification#Rational_B-Spline_Curve_.28Type_126.29&gt;`_,</longdescription>
