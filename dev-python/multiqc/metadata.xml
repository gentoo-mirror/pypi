	<longdescription>MultiQC is a tool to aggregate bioinformatics results across many samples into a single report. It is written in Python and contains modules for a large number of common bioinformatics tools.You can install MultiQC from PyPI as follows::    pip install multiqcThen it's just a case of going to your analysis directory and running the script::    multiqc .MultiQC will scan the specified directory (:code:`'.'` is the current dir) and produce a report detailing whatever it finds.The report is created in :code:`multiqc_report.html` by default. Tab-delimited data files are created in :code:`multiqc_data/` to give easy access for downstream processing.For more detailed instructions, run :code:`multiqc -h`See the MultiQC website for documentation and tutorial videos: http://multiqc.infoMultiQC was written by Phil Ewels (http://phil.ewels.co.uk) at Seqera Labs (https://seqera.io/), originally at SciLifeLab Sweden (http://www.scilifelab.se)</longdescription>
