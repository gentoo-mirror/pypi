It depends on- `numpy` (for arrays) and- `scipy` (check if matrix is sparse and sparse solver).&gt; **Note**&gt; The original motivation was to create a generalized standalone package with the built-in numeric continuation methods taken from the nonlinear truss analysis package [trusspy](https://github.com/adtzlr/trusspy).## Theory of `contique`'s numeric continuationA solution curve for `(n)` equilibrium equations `fun` in terms of `(n)` unknowns `x` and a load-proportionality-factor `lpf` should be found by numeric continuation from an initial equilibrium state `fun(x0, lpf0) = 0`. Contique's numeric continuation method is best classified as a - **component-based continuation** with an adaptive - **magnitude-based control-component switching**.&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adtzlr/contique/blob/main/tests/test_archimedean_spiral.py&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/adtzlr/contique/assets/5793153/6b38c783-bdfc-470a-8a66-82a3ca663407&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Fig. 1 [Archimedean spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral) equation solved with [contique](https://github.com/adtzlr/contique/blob/main/tests/test_archimedean_spiral.py)  ### Extended equilibrium equationsThe `lpf` value is appended to the unknows `x` which gives the so-called extended unknowns `y = [x, lpf]`. One additional control equation is added to the equilibrium equations to ensure `(n+1)` equations in terms of `(n+1)` extended unknowns (see next section). This reduces the solution to a point on the initial solution curve.### Control EquationThe control equation is defined as follows: First, a needle-vector with dimension `(n+1)` is created and filled with zeros `needle = 0`. For a given initial signed control component `j` the needle is positioned at `needle[|j|] = 1`. The maximum allowed values per component are calculated as `ymax = y0 + np.sign(j) dymax`. The control equation is finally formulated as `f(y) = needle.T (y - ymax)`.### Solution techniqueThe numeric solution process is divided into three main parts:- **Step**    + Cycle        * *Iteration* (...of a Newton-Rhapson root method)  As the name implies, a **Step** tries to find the extended unknowns for the next step forward of the equilibrium state. For each Cycle, the initial control component has to be evaluated first (see comment below). The additional control equation is evaluated with this initial control component. The generated extended equilibrium equations in terms of the extended unknows are now solved with the help of a root method (Newton-Rhapson *Iterations*). The solution of the root method `dy` is further normalized as `dy/dymax` and the final control component is evaluated as `j = |j| sign((dy/dymax)[|j|])` with `|j| = argmax(|dy/dymax|)`. If the control component changed, another Cycle is performed with the initial control component being now the final control component of the last cycle. This Cycle-loop is repeated until the control component does not change anymore.A note on the pre-evaluation of the initial control component of a **Step**: This is performed by the linear solution of the extended equilibrium equations. It is equal to the result of the first *Iteration* of the Newton-Rhapson root method.## ExampleA given set of equilibrium equations in terms of `x` and `lpf` (a.k.a. load-proportionality-factor) should be solved by numeric continuation of a given initial solution.### Function definition```pythondef fun(x, lpf, a, b):    return np.array(        [-a * np.sin(x[0]) + x[1] ** 2 + lpf, -b * np.cos(x[1]) * x[1] + lpf]    )```with its initial solution```pythonx0 = np.zeros(2)lpf0 = 0.0```and function parameters```pythona = 1b = 1```### Run `contique.solve` and plot equilibrium states```pythonRes = contique.solve(    fun=fun,    x0=x0,    args=(a, b),    lpf0=lpf0,    dxmax=0.1,    dlpfmax=0.1,    maxsteps=75,    maxcycles=4,    maxiter=20,    tol=1e-8,    overshoot=1.05,)```For each `step` a summary is printed out per `cycle`. This contains an information about the control component at the beginning and the end of a cycle as well as the norm of the residuals along with needed Newton-Rhapson `iterations` per `cycle`. As an example the ouput of some interesting `steps` 31-33 and 38-40 are shown below. The last column contains messages about the solution. On the one hand, in `step` 32, `cycle` 1 the control component changed from `+1` to `-2`, but the relative overshoot on the final control component `-2` was inside the tolerated range of `overshoot=1.05`. Therefore the solver proceeds with `step` 33 without re-cycling `step` 32. On the other hand, in `step` 39, `cycle` 1 the control component changed from `-2` to `-1` and this time the overshoot on the final control component `-1` was outside the tolerated range. A new `cycle` 2 is performed for `step` 39 with the new control component `-1`.```markdown|Step,C.| Control Comp. | Norm (Iter.#) | Message     ||-------|---------------|---------------|-------------|(...)|  31,1 |   +1  =&gt;   +1 | 7.6e-10 ( 3#) |             ||  32,1 |   +1  =&gt;   -2 | 1.7e-14 ( 4#) |tol.Overshoot||  33,1 |   -2  =&gt;   -2 | 4.8e-12 ( 3#) |             | (...) |  38,1 |   -2  =&gt;   -2 | 9.2e-12 ( 3#) |             ||  39,1 |   -2  =&gt;   -1 | 1.9e-13 ( 3#) | =&gt; re-Cycle ||     2 |   -1  =&gt;   -1 | 2.3e-13 ( 4#) |             ||  40,1 |   -1  =&gt;   -1 | 7.9e-09 ( 3#) |             |(...)```Next, we have to assemble the results```pythonX = np.array([res.x for res in Res])```and plot the solution curve.```pythonimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltplt.plot(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], &quot;C0.-&quot;)plt.xlabel(&quot;$x_1$&quot;)plt.ylabel(&quot;$x_2$&quot;)plt.plot([0], [0], &quot;C0o&quot;, lw=3)plt.arrow(    X[-2, 0],    X[-2, 1],    X[-1, 0] - X[-2, 0],    X[-1, 1] - X[-2, 1],    head_width=0.075,    head_length=0.15,    fc=&quot;C0&quot;,    ec=&quot;C0&quot;,)plt.gca().set_aspect(&quot;equal&quot;)```&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adtzlr/contique/blob/main/tests/test_sincos.py&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/adtzlr/contique/assets/5793153/20fb6415-d226-4859-b818-4f79194ba1e2&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Fig. 2 Solution states of [equilibrium equations](https://github.com/adtzlr/contique/blob/main/tests/test_sincos.py) solved with contique# ChangelogAll notable changes to this project will be documented in [this file](CHANGELOG.md).
