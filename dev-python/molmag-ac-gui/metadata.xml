	<longdescription># Molmag AC GUIImport `process_ac` to use in scripts with your own data.Install with```python -m pip install molmag_ac_gui```Run with```python -m molmag_ac_gui```To use the GUI for fitting relaxation times, your own file with data of (T, tau) can be loaded and fitted in the &quot;Analysis&quot;-tabwhen the file is formatted as (the header line is mandatory, but the content is of no importance)```Temp;TauT1;tau1(;dtau1)T2;tau2(;dtau2)T3;tau3(;dtau3)...```...#v. 0.4.0Published on 09/03/2022Adds DC functionality: Plotting of H vs. M and T vs. XT is now possible. Adds a function to display and save fitting statistics in Data analysis. # v. 0.3.0Published on 07/02/2022Changed layout of Data Treatment and Data Analysis tab and adds Data Table tab. Makes internal changes to fitting procedures.# v. 0.2.9Published on 26/10/2021Makes Windows-specific code only run on Windows# v. 0.2.8Published on 26/10/2021Updated read_options so SQUID-files can be read# v. 0.2.7Published on 25/10/2021# v. 0.2.6Published on 20/10/2021Removed requirements from setup.py.Will instead rely on third-party packages being imported in __init__.py# v. 0.2.5Published on 12/5/2021Added option to color the measured data points# v. 0.2.4:Published on 11/3/2021Quick fix to show Ueff in kelvin in the fitted parameters dialog# v. 0.2.3:Published on 11/3/2021Added a fit history so the last 10 fits can be retrived to see the parametersor use the parameters as starting guesses for new fits or to use the parametersto plot the simulation# v. 0.2.2:Published on 4/3/2021Adding a data-folder to hold static variables. This will also  make it easier in the future to add a function to change which  header values can be read by the interface.# v. 0.2.1:Published on 3/3/2021Changed fitting procedures so   - function to fit Xp and Xpp together is now in a separate function in process_ac - fitting of Xp and Xpp in the GUI is now done by multiprocessing# v. 0.2.0:Published on 1/3/2021Fixed issues relating to   - loading of PPMS-data (issue #8) - loading of T,tau-data (issue #5, issue #9) - calculation of diamagnetic corrections (issue #6) - now using matplotlib to handle color mapping (issue #11)# v. 0.1.10:Fixed issue with loading ACMS data files (issue #4 on Github)# v. 0.1.9:Fixed import issue in importing process_ac# v. 0.1.8:Removed a dependency on my own library of scientific constants and replaced with scipy.constants</longdescription>
