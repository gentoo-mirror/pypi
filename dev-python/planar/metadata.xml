	<longdescription>Planar Overview===============*Note: planar is no longer under active development.*Planar is a 2D geometry library for Python. It is intended for use by gamesand interactive real-time applications, but is designed to be useful formost any program that needs a convenient, high-performance geometry API.Planar is being developed as part of the larger Grease game framework. However, it is a standalone library and has no external dependencies besidesPython, and optionally a C compiler.Planar is purely a math library, presentation, graphical or otherwise isleft up to the application.Project Goals-------------* Do one thing, 2D geometry, and do it well.* Provide a high-level, clean, Pythonic API.* All APIs have both a Python reference implementation and a high performance  implementation in C with the same interface.* Compatibility with Python 2.6+, and Python 3.1+* 100% test coverage.* Full narrative and API reference documentation.* Platform-independent.* Release early and often.* Be responsive to community input.* Don't take ourselves too seriously.License-------Planar is distributed under the terms of the new BSD license. You are free touse it for commercial or non-commercial projects with little or norestriction, all we ask is that:* Redistributions of the code, in whole or part, retain the original  copyright notice and license text.* You do not claim our endorsement of any derived product.For a complete text of the license see the ``LICENSE.txt`` file in the sourcedistrbution.Acknowledgements ----------------The API for planar, and some of the code is derived from the excellent work done by the Super Effective Team, thanks guys!* http://www.supereffective.org/pages/Vector-2d-Vector-LibraryRequirements------------Planar requires Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, or better.To experience the exhilaration of native-code performance, a C compiler isrequired. If someone volunteers, binary releases for platforms where thisis not common (you know who you are) will be happily made available.Downloading Planar------------------Planar releases can be downloaded from the python package index (pypi):* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/planar/You can get the latest code in development from the planar mercurial repository on bitbucket:* http://bitbucket.org/caseman/planar/Installation------------To build and install Planar from the source distribution or repository use::    python setup.py installTo install only the pure-Python modules without compiling, use::python setup.py build_py install --skip-buildOnly performance is sacrificed without the C extensions, all functionality isstill available when using only the pure-Python modules.Tests-----Planar requires nose for testing. You can install it for Python 2.xusing easy_install::easy_install noseFor Python 3.x, you can download and install distribute from here:* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distributeFor now, you can get a copy of nose3 for Python 3.x, patched to installproperly on Python 3.1 here:* http://bitbucket.org/caseman/nose3-caseman-fix/get/7c9181ad403d.zipOnce nose is installed you can run the tests from the source directoryusing ``nosetests``, first building the C extensions, like so (on Unix)::python setup.py build &amp;&amp; nosetests -d -w build/lib.*/planar/This runs the tests inside the ``build`` directory so that the C extensionscan be tested. You can put a ``3`` suffix on the ``python`` and ``nosetests``commands above for Python 3.x. Documentation-------------You can browse the documentation online here:* http://pygamesf.org/~casey/planar/doc/The same documentation is also available for offline browsing in the``doc/build/html`` subdirectory of the source distribution.Contributing and Getting Support--------------------------------Come visit us at the Grease users google group to get help, moral support,lavish praise, complain bitterly, report a bug, or contribute ideas:* http://groups.google.com/group/grease-users</longdescription>
