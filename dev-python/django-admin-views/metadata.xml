	<longdescription>Overview========While &quot;the admin is not your app&quot;, it is often useful to be able to easily adda bit of functionality to the admin for internal staff or other internal usersthat are tech savvy enough to use the admin.There are several third party project such as`AdminPlus &lt;https://github.com/jsocol/django-adminplus&gt;`_, but they require theuser to redefine the Admin.site object.  This is fine for developers who aresetting up a Django project, but not ideal for developers who are writingthird party tools for other developers to use in their projects.django-admin-views attempts to solve this by simply overriding the admintemplates to provide two features:1. Easily define custom admin views and link them on the admin pages2. Easily add in external URL linksInstallation Steps==================1. ``pip install django-admin-views``2. Add ``admin_views`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your ``settings.py`` before admin site, i.e. ``django.contrib.admin``If you are using a custom Admin Site, you'll need to configure the ``ADMIN_VIEWS_SITE`` setting to point to your admin site instance::    ADMIN_VIEWS_SITE = 'myproject.admin.admin_site'Usage=====All of this magic happens in your model's admin definition.  You simply subclass youradmin from ``AdminViews`` instead of the standard ``admin.ModelAdmin``.In this example we have a custom view that does nothing but redirect the user to CNNand a direct URL link that goes to my company's homepage::    from django.contrib import admin    from django.shortcuts import redirect    from admin_views.admin import AdminViews    from example_app.models import TestModel    class TestAdmin(AdminViews):        admin_views = (                        ('Redirect to CNN', 'redirect_to_cnn'),                        ('Go to google.com', 'https:/google.com'),            )        def redirect_to_cnn(self, *args, **kwargs):            return redirect('https://www.cnn.com')    admin.site.register(TestModel, TestAdmin)These will now show up in the admin below the usual Django admin model CRUD interfacesfor `example_app` with a couple of different icons to distinquish between custom adminviews and a direct URL link.With this third-party developers need only instruct their users to install their appand ``django-admin-views``.Hope you find it useful and as always feedback is certainly welcome.Screenshot==========.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koleror/django-admin-views/master/screenshots/admin.pngAuthor======Frank Wiles frank@revsys.comMaintainer==========Hugo Defrance defrance.hugo@gmail.com</longdescription>
