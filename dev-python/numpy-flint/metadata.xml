	<longdescription># Rounded Floating Point ArithmeticThis package implements a rounded **fl**oating point **int**ervals or `flint` data-typein python and NumPy. The floating point interval type contains a pair of numbers thatdefine the endpoint of an interval, and the exact value of a computation always liessomewhere in that interval. This type addresses one shortcoming of floating pointnumbers: equality comparisons. For this package, the equality operator for flints isimplemented such that any overlap of the interval will be treated as equal, and shouldbe though of as 'could be equal'.To use in python, import the flint package and declare the number as a flint type.```pyfrom flint import flint# Floating point numbers sometimes don't make sensea = 0.2b = 0.6# This evaluate to Falseprint( (a+a+a) == b )# Rounded floating point intervals will fix these issuesx = flint(0.2)y = flint(0.6)# This evalautes to Trueprint( (x+x+x) == y )```To use with NumPy, import NumPy as well and mark the array's dtype as `flint`.```pyimport numpy as npfrom flint import flinta = np.fill((3,), 0.2, dtype=flint)b = flint(0.6)# This evaluates to Trueprint( np.sum(a) == b )```Further useage examples as well as a full API can be found on the [project homepage](https://jefwagner.github.io/flint/)# InstallationBinary packages are avialable from [PyPI](https://pypi.org). Use `pip` to install thebinary package.```sh&gt; python -m pip install numpy-flint```If there not a version for your system, you can visit the [project homepage](https://jefwagner.github.io/flint/) which has instructions on building from source or contributing to the project.### LicenseCopyright (c) 2023, Jef WagnerNumpy-flint is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the termsof the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, eitherversion 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.Numpy-flint is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE.
