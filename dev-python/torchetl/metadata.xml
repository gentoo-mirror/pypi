	<longdescription># TorchETLIf you're working on classification problem, with dataset that is available in their native format (jpg, bmp, etc) and have PyTorch in your arsenal, you'll most likely feel that the **DatasetFolder** or **ImageFolder** is not good enough. So does vanilla **torch.utils.data.Dataset**. This library attempts to bridge that gap to effectively Extract, Transform, and Load your data by extending **torch.utils.data.Dataset**.  ### Main FeaturesExtract class would partition your dataset into train, validation, and test csvTransformAndLoad class would Transform and consume your dataset efficiently### PrerequisitesPython 3.7.2 (other versions might work if type checking is supported)torchtorchvisionnumpypandasopencv-pythonsklearnOr simply download requirements.txt and fire 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt'### Installingpip3 install torchetl### TutorialSee tutorial/Tutorial.ipynb</longdescription>
