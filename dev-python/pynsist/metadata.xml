	<longdescription>Pynsist is a tool to build Windows installers for your Python applications. Theinstallers bundle Python itself, so you can distribute your application topeople who don't have Python installed.For more information, see `the documentation &lt;https://pynsist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_and `the examples &lt;https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist/tree/master/examples&gt;`_.Pynsist 2.7 requires Python 3.6 or above.You can use `Pynsist 2.6 &lt;http://pynsist.readthedocs.io/en/2.6/&gt;`_ on Python 3.5,and `Pynsist 1.x &lt;http://pynsist.readthedocs.io/en/1.12/&gt;`_ on Python 2.7 andPython 3.3 or above, but these versions won't get further updates.Quickstart----------1. Get the tools. Install `NSIS &lt;http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download&gt;`_, and   then install pynsist from PyPI by running ``pip install pynsist``.2. Write a config file ``installer.cfg``, like this:   .. code-block:: ini          [Application]       name=My App       version=1.0       # How to launch the app - this calls the 'main' function from the 'myapp' package:       entry_point=myapp:main       icon=myapp.ico       [Python]       version=3.6.3       [Include]       # Packages from PyPI that your application requires, one per line       # These must have wheels on PyPI:       pypi_wheels = requests==2.18.4            beautifulsoup4==4.6.0            html5lib==0.999999999       # To bundle packages which don't publish wheels, or to include directly wheel files       # from a directory, see the docs on the config file.       # Other files and folders that should be installed       files = LICENSE           data_files/3. Run ``pynsist installer.cfg`` to generate your installer. If ``pynsist`` isn't   found, you can use ``python -m nsist installer.cfg`` instead.This example illustrates how to use Pynsist by itself, for simple projects.There are other options which can make it easier to integrate as a step ina more complex build process. See the docs for more information.</longdescription>
