	<longdescription># estraces - Traces and trace sets Python library for side-channel attacks[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/eshard/estraces/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/eshard/estraces/commits/master)[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/estraces.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/estraces/)[![Conda installer](https://anaconda.org/eshard/estraces/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/eshard/estraces)[![Latest Conda release](https://anaconda.org/eshard/estraces/badges/latest_release_date.svg)](https://anaconda.org/eshard/estraces)estraces is a Python library to manipulate side-channel trace sets. It aims at giving a clear and uniform API to handletraces samples and metadata for various persistency and file formats.It uses [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org) to handle data.estraces was originally developped and maintain by [eshard](https://www.eshard.com), and is heavily used in the open-sourceside-channel analysis framework [scared](https://gitlab.com/eshard/scared).## Getting started### Requirements and installationestraces requires and must work on Python **3.6**, **3.7**, **3.8**, **3.9**, **3.10** versions.Python 3.7 is outdated now [EOL date](https://endoflife.date/python)You can install it by several ways:- from source- with `pip`- with `conda`&gt;At time of writing, we highly recommend to install from `conda` when using `estraces` with **python 3.8**.#### Installing from sourceTo install estraces from source, you will need the following requirements:- `pip` and `setuptools` with version greater than **40.0**- For Python **3.8**, you'll need to build and install `h5py` from source see [H5PY installation instructions](https://h5py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html#source-installation) before installing `estraces`From the source code folder, run:```pythonpip install .```#### Installing with `pip`First, you should update your `pip` and `setuptools` version:```bashpip install -U pip setuptools```If you use **Python 3.8** or above, you must first build and install `h5py`, [see instructions](https://h5py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html#source-installation).```bashpip install estraces```#### Installing with  `conda`To install from `conda`, simply run:```bashconda install -c eshard estraces```### Opens a trace setIf you have a trace set as binary files, you can get a trace header set by using the binary reader:```python# First import the libimport estraces# We suppose the binary files are under traces/ and are named something.binmy_traces = estraces.read_ths_from_bin_filenames_pattern(    'traces/*.bin', # First indicate the filename pattern for the bin file    dtype='uint8', # Indicate the numpy dtype of the data    metadatas_parsers={} # This dict allows to associate metadata)```You can then read your samples:```python# This will return the data for the first 100 tracesmy_traces.samples[:100]# This will return the frame 0 - 1000 of all the traces as a numpy arraymy_traces.samples[:, :1000]# You can iterate on tracesfor trace in my_traces:    # do something```## DocumentationTo go further and learn all about estraces, please go to [the full documentation](https://eshard.gitlab.io/estraces).## ContributingAll contributions, starting with feedbacks, are welcomed.Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you wish to contribute to the project.## LicenseThis library is licensed under LGPL V3 license.
