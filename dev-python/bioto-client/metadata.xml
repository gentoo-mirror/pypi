	<longdescription># PyClientPython Client for retrieving Bioto sensor data## Goals### Session management- [x] create session via device login to get a valid access token### Retrieving sensor data- [x] find a garden- [x] subscribe to that garden- [x] see subscribtion state for that garden (pending/approved/declined)- [x] get an overview of your gardens- [x] retrieve sensor data from garden devices## Getting startedThere are two ways of installing this client. The first one using pip:```bash% pip install --user bioto-client```The second option is useful when developing the client. Git clone the projectand use `make` for installation. This will setup a[virtual python environment][3] managed via [`poetry`][4].```bash% make install% poetry shell```## How to use&gt; **Tip** Use `bioto-client --help` to see other available commands### Start a user sessionA user session is valid for 24h. When expired you're requested to create a newsession. This can be done as follows:```bash# Call the client with the `user` command to assert a valid session% bioto-client userLoading sessionNot logged in, please take the following steps:1. On your computer or mobile device navigate to: https://biotoco.eu.auth0.com/activate?user_code=NEWT-OKEN2. Enter the following code:  NEWT-OKENSuccesfully logged in.Bioto CLI client: 1.2.3Environment: prodSession token ***5OFd09w```### Find a gardenGardens can be found by name, the command to do this is:```bash% bioto-client search-garden {name}```### Subscribe to a gardenTo gain access to the data of this garden you need to subscribe to this gardenusing its `ID`:```bash% bioto-client subscribe-garden {garden_id}```This will create a subscription request which only the mainter(s) can approve.To check the state of your subscription see:```bash% bioto-client subscriptions```### Read device dataReading a device is done by `device ID`, these can be found via the gardencommand. Note that a garden might contain multiple devices.To get the latest hourly readings for the last 24h issue the following command:```bash% bioto-client device {device_id}```To get these readings for a sepecific date apply a date option. The followingformats are allowed: [%Y-%m-%d | %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S | %H:%M:%S]:```bash% bioto-client device {device_id} --date={date}```And to limit or increase the number of hours returned add the hours option:```bash% bioto-client device {device_id} --hours={hours_limit}```## Improve the clientIf you want to improve the client or add something which you think is missing tothe project you can either [open an issue][1] or develop the feature yourselfand open [a pull request with your changes][2].To get started clone this project and create a branch. Now fix the bug or createthe feature you want and write some tests for it to prove it works. This can bedone by executing:```bash% make check```&gt; **Note** This will run both tests and linters, use `make test` when you're in`red - green - refactor` modeWhen the checks are all passing, please open a [PR][2][1]: https://github.com/wearebioto/PyClient/issues[2]: https://github.com/wearebioto/PyClient/pulls[3]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html[4]: https://python-poetry.org/docs/</longdescription>
