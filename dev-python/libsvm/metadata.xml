Itsupports multi-class classification.Original Links---------------  Repository: https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm-  Library website: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmPurpose of this package-----------------------The idea behind this package is to use the same code as inhttps://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm using the very convenient pip commandHow to install--------------::   pip install libsvmExample-------1. Download https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm/blob/master/heart_scale   file.2. Run the following commands::   &gt;&gt;&gt; from libsvm.svmutil import *   &gt;&gt;&gt; y, x = svm_read_problem('path/to/heart_scale')   &gt;&gt;&gt; m = svm_train(y[:200], x[:200], '-c 4')   *.*   optimization finished, #iter = 257   nu = 0.351161   obj = -225.628984, rho = 0.636110   nSV = 91, nBSV = 49   Total nSV = 91   &gt;&gt;&gt; p_label, p_acc, p_val = svm_predict(y[200:], x[200:], m)   Accuracy = 84.2857% (59/70) (classification)Windows-------The package contains a pre-built Windows binary that is only compatible with 64 bits architecture; therefore,32 bits architecture is not compatible.Cygwin______In case that you want to install this package using Cygwin, you have to make sure that thefollowing packages are installed:1. gcc-g++ &gt;= 7.0.02. python383. python38-devel4. python38-pipSome good tutorials to install Cygwin packages are the following:- https://wiki.usask.ca/display/MESH/Running+Python+from+the+Cygwin+Terminal- https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/set-up-python-windows/#installing-cygwinCopyright---------Copyright (c) 2000-2018 Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin All rightsreserved.Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or withoutmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions aremet:1.
