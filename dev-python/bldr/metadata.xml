	<longdescription>BLDR====Build debian packages in a clean docker environmentFeatures:* provide a dockerized dpkg-buildpackage wrapper, as Docker can be used to create a clean build environment for Debian packaging* easy-to-use: navigate inside a directory that has a debian subdirectory and run build* collect the debian dependencies automatically and puts them in Docker build layer* cache the dependency install step and the re-build will be quicker* to test the debian package you can enter to the container which contains the build environment* the built debian package is stored in a local apt repository* build multiple dependent packages, if called multiple times (uses the built packages as build dependencies of the next ones)</longdescription>
