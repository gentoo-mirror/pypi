Using `__Secure-1PSID`, you can ask questions and get answers from Google Bard. This package is designed for application to the Python package [ExceptNotifier](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/ExceptNotifier) and [Co-Coder](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Co-Coder). Please note that the bardapi is not a free service, but rather a tool provided to assist developers with testing certain functionalities due to the delayed development and release of Google Bard's API. It has been designed with a lightweight structure that can easily adapt to the emergence of an official API. Therefore, I strongly discourage using it for any other purposes.&lt;br&gt;# [hf-transllm](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/hf-transllm)If you want to test the open-llama model, which is `released under the Apache License (allowing free commercial use)` in `various languages`, you can try using the [hf-transllm](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/hf-transllm) package. hf-transllm also supports multilingual inference for various LLMs stored in hugging face repository.    &lt;br&gt;##  [Amazing Bard Prompts](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/amazing-bard-prompts) Is All You Need!- Helpful prompts for Google Bard&lt;br&gt;## InstallIf you will not provide the language parameter (use `english`, `korean`, `japanese` only as input text):```pip install bardapi```If you wish to use the Bard API, including various features:```pip install git+https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API.git```&lt;br&gt;## Authentication&gt; **Warning** Do not expose the `__Secure-1PSID` 1. Visit https://bard.google.com/2. F12 for console3. Session: Application → Cookies → Copy the value of  `__Secure-1PSID` cookie.Note that while I referred to `__Secure-1PSID` value as an API key for convenience, it is not an officially provided API key. Cookie value subject to frequent changes. Verify the value again if an error occurs. Most errors occur when an invalid cookie value is entered.&lt;br&gt;If you need to set multiple Cookie values- [Bard Cookies](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/README_DEV.md#bard-which-can-get-cookies) - After confirming that multiple cookie values are required to receive responses reliably in certain countries, I will deploy it for testing purposes. Please debug and create a pull request&lt;br&gt;## Usage [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zzzlTIh0kt2MdjLzvXRby1rWbHzmog8t?usp=sharing) Simple Usage```pythonfrom bardapi import Bardtoken = 'xxxxxxx'bard = Bard(token=token)bard.get_answer(&quot;나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘&quot;)['content']```Or you can use this```pythonfrom bardapi import Bardimport osos.environ['_BARD_API_KEY']=&quot;xxxxxxx&quot;Bard().get_answer(&quot;나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘&quot;)['content']```To get reponse dictionary```pythonimport bardapiimport os# set your __Secure-1PSID value to keytoken = 'xxxxxxx'# set your input textinput_text = &quot;나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘&quot;# Send an API request and get a response.response = bardapi.core.Bard(token).get_answer(input_text)```Addressing errors caused by delayed responses in environments like Google Colab and containers. If an error occurs despite following the proper procedure, utilize the timeout argument.```pythonfrom bardapi import Bardimport osos.environ['_BARD_API_KEY']=&quot;xxxxxxx&quot;bard = Bard(timeout=30) # Set timeout in secondsbard.get_answer(&quot;나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘&quot;)['content']```&lt;br&gt;## Further### Behind a proxyIf you are working behind a proxy, use the following.```pythonfrom bardapi import Bardimport os# Change 'http://proxy.example.com:8080' to your http proxy# timeout in secondsproxies = {    'http': 'http://proxy.example.com:8080',    'https': 'https://proxy.example.com:8080'}bard = Bard(token='xxxxxxx', proxies=proxies, timeout=30)bard.get_answer(&quot;나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘&quot;)['content']```### Reusable session objectYou can continue the conversation using a reusable session.```pythonfrom bardapi import Bardimport osimport requestsos.environ['_BARD_API_KEY'] = 'xxxxxxx'# token='xxxxxxx'session = requests.Session()session.headers = {            &quot;Host&quot;: &quot;bard.google.com&quot;,            &quot;X-Same-Domain&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,            &quot;User-Agent&quot;: &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.114 Safari/537.36&quot;,            &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8&quot;,            &quot;Origin&quot;: &quot;https://bard.google.com&quot;,            &quot;Referer&quot;: &quot;https://bard.google.com/&quot;,        }session.cookies.set(&quot;__Secure-1PSID&quot;, os.getenv(&quot;_BARD_API_KEY&quot;)) # session.cookies.set(&quot;__Secure-1PSID&quot;, token) bard = Bard(token=token, session=session, timeout=30)bard.get_answer(&quot;나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘&quot;)['content']# Continued conversation without set new sessionbard.get_answer(&quot;What is my last prompt??&quot;)['content']```&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;# [More features](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/README_DEV.md)Starting from version `0.1.18`, the GitHub version of BardAPI will be synchronized with the PyPI version and released simultaneously. &lt;br&gt;```pip install git+https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API.git```- [Multi-language Bard API](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/README_DEV.md#multi-language-bard-api)- [Get image links](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/README_DEV.md#get-image-links)- [ChatBard](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/README_DEV.md#chatbard)- [Executing Python code received as a response from Bard](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/README_DEV.md#chatbard)- [Translation to Another Programming Language](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/README_DEV.md#chatbard)- [Using Bard Asynchronously](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/README_DEV.md#using-bard-asynchronously)- [Bard Cookies](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/README_DEV.md#bard-which-can-get-cookies)- [Fix Coversation ID (Fix Context)](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/README_DEV.md#fix-conversation-id-fix-context)&lt;br&gt;# Example code of [hf-transllm](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/hf-transllm)&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;In case the Google package is no longer available due to policy restrictions, here's a simple example code for using open-source language models (LLMs) in both English and multiple languages.&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;## UsageFor the decoder models provided by Hugging Face, you can easily use them by either following a simple approach or overriding the inference method. You can explore various open-source language models at [this link](https://huggingface.co/models). Through the ranking information from [Open LLM Leader Board Report repository](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Open-LLM-Leaderboard-Report), you can find information about good models.### For LLM that use languages `other than English````pythonfrom transllm import LLMtranslatoropen_llama3b_kor = LLMtranslator('openlm-research/open_llama_3b', target_lang='ko', translator='google') # Koreantrnaslated_answer = open_llama3b_kor.generate(&quot;나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘&quot;)print(trnaslated_answer)```### For LLM that use `English`Refer https://github.com/openlm-research/open_llama or using like this:```pythonfrom transllm import LLMtranslatoropen_llama3b = LLMtranslator('openlm-research/open_llama_3b) answer = open_llama3b.generate(&quot;Tell me about the Korean girl group Newjeans.&quot;)print(answer)```&lt;/details&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;## ScriptsIn the scripts [folder](./scripts/), I have released a script to help you compare [OpenAI-ChatGPT](./scripts/openai_api.ipynb), [Microsoft-EdgeGPT](./scripts/microsoft_api.ipynb) and [Google-Bard](./scripts/google_api.ipynb). I hope they will help more developers.## ContributorsI would like to express my sincere gratitude for the contributions made by all the contributors.&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard_API/graphs/contributors&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=dsdanielpark/Bard_API&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;## License[MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) &lt;br&gt;I hold no legal responsibility; for more information, please refer to the bottom of the readme file.
