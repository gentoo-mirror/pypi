	<longdescription>NET-CONTEXTDIFF===============This package contains two main elements used to compare text-basedconfiguration files (or other files in simple text in a similar format) wherethey are structured using indented blocks of directives/commands, typically fornetwork devices:* a parser to read in configuration files and stored them in a dictionary --  the parser utilises the hierarchical nature of the configuration to  understand that the same command name might mean different things in  different contexts* a comparator that takes two configuration dictionaries (typically produced by  the parser, above) - a source and a target configuration - and writes out  a configuration file (or update command set) to transform the source  configuration into the destination - this uses a series of 'converters' to  handle the difference for each configuration element (e.g. changing the  description assigned to an interface)Each of these are written as abstract base classes that can be inherited fromto crete concrete classes for each platform, but the base processing of theparsing and comparing should be consistent, requiring only the specificcommands to be handled.Currently, Cisco IOS is the only concrete platform and only a subset so far(the comparator is still being tweaked to handle this all relativelystraightforwardly, before all the commands are implemented).  There arecurrently some odd commands and edge cases which are awkward to handle withoutsome improvements to the core process.The scripts also support a system whereby 'excludes' can be specified, toexclude those elements of the configuration dictionary which should not becompared, if a known difference exists that cannot be resolved, either as aninterim divergence, or a permanent exception.</longdescription>
