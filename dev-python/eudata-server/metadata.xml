	<longdescription># Arno's super duper APIThis is a super duper API that does super duper things.## InstallationJust use pip if you're a regular user:```bashpip install eudata-server```If you want to develop, clone the repo and install the requirements### Sass[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) is used to compile the CSS.If you're on Windows I recommend using [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/):```powershellscoop install sass```If you're on Linux, you can use the [homebrew package manager](brew.sh):```bashbrew install sass/sass/sass```A failsafe way to install Dart-Sass is to download the latest release as a zip/tar archive from [here](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.57.1) and add it to your PATH.## Customization### Sass CustomizationThe Sass files are located in `eudata_server/static/sass`. For now the only file to compile is the grid theme file, `grid-theme.scss`.  To compile it, run:```bashsass -w ./eudata_server/assets/sass/grid-theme.scss ./eudata_server/assets/css/grid-theme.css```Or if you're on Windows:```powershellsass -w .\eudata_server\assets\sass\grid-theme.scss .\eudata_server\assets\css\grid-theme.css```</longdescription>
