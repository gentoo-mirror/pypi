	<longdescription>#DEPRECATEDGo to https://github.com/innobi/pantab for a maintained package# Tableau Hyper IO: read and write Tableau hyper files using Pandas DataFrames[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/tableauhyperio)](https://pypi.org/project/tableauhyperio)[![PyPI - License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/tableauhyperio)](https://github.com/AlexFrid/tableauhyperio/blob/master/LICENSE)[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)## What is it?A simple way to read Tableau hyper files into Pandas DataFramesand write to Tableau hyper files from Pandas DataFrames.## Why was this made?For a project I was working on I needed to read hyper files.I searched if a package already existed and found only the [pandleau](https://pypi.org/project/pandleau/) package,which only writes to hyper files but does not read them and also uses the older extract 2.0 API.Since I couldn't find any other package that met my needs I decided to make one myself, which has been a good learning experience.## InstallationYou can install tableauhyperio using pip:```bashpip install tableauhyperio```This will also try downloading the Tableau hyper API, tqdm and pandas packagesif you don't have them already.## Example usage```pythonimport tableauhyperio as hio# Reading a regular hyper filedf = hio.read_hyper(&quot;example.hyper&quot;)# Reading a hyper file with a custom schemadf = hio.read_hyper(&quot;example.hyper&quot;, &quot;my_schema&quot;)# Writing a regular hyper filehio.to_hyper(df, &quot;example_output.hyper&quot;)# Writing a hyper file with a custom schema and custom table namehio.to_hyper(df, &quot;example_output.hyper&quot;, &quot;my_schema&quot;, &quot;my_table&quot;)```## Dependencies- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)- [tableauhyperapi](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/hyper_api/en-us/index.html)- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)</longdescription>
