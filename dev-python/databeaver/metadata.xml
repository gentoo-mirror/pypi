First you would write some sqlthen you would run the manually one by one. With Data Beaver a simple `beaver build` command will generate all the modelsin their correct order, respecting dependencies. * (Not Yet) Visualize Model Dependencies - In a large model it can be tricky to keep track on what tables depend on whatother tables. Instead of trying to keep track of that yourself, let DataBeaver extract it directly from the sql and generateand image file for you all with the simple `beaver visualize` command  ### Using DataBeaver as a command line application #### Step 1 - Create a New ProjectBefore we start we need to create the basic directory structure needed and a configuration file that can be edited.  *Command* ```bashbeaver create-project --name=&lt;projectName&gt;```### Execute a model Data Beaver can be used as either a command line application or as a module for a more direct integration. #### Module Usage```pythonfrom databeaver import DataModelmodel = DataModel()model.build()```## Major Releases| Version | Goal |Status||---------|----------------------------------------------------------|------||0.1.0    | Add the command line utility 'beaver' and 'DataBeaver' class |In Progress||0.2.0    | Build a Model against in Postgres                        |||0.3.0    | Build database models in MySQL                           ||## Minor Releases | Version | Purpose                                                                       ||---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------||0.0.37   | DataBeaver.build() now returns info on the models and files that were processed |## Additional Documentation[Classes](./docs/classes.md)&lt;br&gt;[Configuration](./docs/configuration.md)</longdescription>
