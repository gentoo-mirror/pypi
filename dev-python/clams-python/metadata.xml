	<longdescription>## CLAMS project[CLAMS project](https://clams.ai) aims at free and open-source software platform for computational analysis and metadata generation applications for multimedia material. We believe free and open AI-based multimedia processing platform can bring many benefits of technical advancement to libraries, archives, and museums. To achieve interoperability between various computational applications developed be different vendors, which is absolutely necessary for using applications together supported by user-friendly workflow engines, we are also developing JSON-based MultiMedia Interchange Format ([MMIF](https://mmif.clams.ai))## clams-python`clams-python` is a Python implementation of the CLAMS SDK. `clams-python` provides CLAMS app developers with the following assistance ; 1. handling MMIF files for input and output specification for CLAMS apps1. a base Python class to start developing a CLAMS app1. a flask-based wrapper to run a Python CLAMS app as an HTTP web app1. cookie-cutter shell command that sets up everything and starts a new CLAMS app project### Start now from [Getting Started](introduction.html)!## For more ...For user manuals and Python API documentation, take a look at [Python modules](https://clams.ai/clams-python/modules.html).For MMIF-specific Python API documentation, take a look at the [mmif-python website](https://clams.ai/mmif-python).</longdescription>
