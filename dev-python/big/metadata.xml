	<longdescription>![# big](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/larryhastings/big/master/resources/images/big.header.png)##### Copyright 2022-2023 by Larry Hastings**big** is a Python package, a grab-bag of useful technologyI always want to have handy.Finally!  For years, I've copied-and-pasted all my littlehelper functions between projects--we've all done it.But now I've finally taken the time to consolidate all thoseuseful little functions into one big package, so they're alwaysat hand, ready to use.And, since it's a public package, you can use 'em too!Not only that, but I've taken my time and re-thought andretooled a lot of these functions.  All the difficult-to-use,overspecialized, cheap hacks have been upgraded with elegantnew APIs and clever functionality.**big** is a real pleasure to use!**big** requires Python 3.6 or newer.  Its only dependencyis `python-dateutil`, and that's optional.*Think big!*## Using bigTo use **big**, just install the **big** package (and its dependencies)from PyPI using your favorite Python package manager.Once **big** is installed, you can simply import it.  However, thetop-level **big** package doesn't contain anything but a version number.Internally **big** is broken up into submodules, aggregated togetherloosely by problem domain, and you can selectively import just thefunctions you want.  For example, if you only want to use the text functions,just import the **text** submodule:```Pythonimport big.text```If you'd prefer to import everything all at once, simply import the**big.all** module.  This one module imports all the other modules,and imports all their symbols too.  So, one convenient way to workwith **big** is this:```Pythonimport big.all as big```That will make every symbol defined in **big** accessible from the `big`object. For example, if you want to use[`multisplit`,](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)you can call it with just `big.multisplit`.You can also use **big.all** with `import *`:```Pythonfrom big.all import *```but that's up to you.**big** is licensed using the [MIT license.](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)You're free to use it and even ship it in your own programs, as long as you leave my copyrightnotice on the source code.# Index[`ascii_newlines`](#newlines)[`ascii_newlines_without_dos`](#newlines)[`ascii_whitespace`](#whitespace)[`ascii_whitespace_without_dos`](#whitespace)[`big.boundinnerclass`](#`bigboundinnerclass`)[`big.builtin`](#bigbuiltin)[`big.file`](#bigfile)[`big.graph`](#biggraph)[`big.heap`](#bigheap)[`big.itertools`](#bigitertools)[`big.log`](#biglog)[`big.scheduler`](#bigscheduler)[`big.text`](#bigtext)[`big.time`](#bigtime)[`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)[`CycleError`](#cycleerror)[`datetime_ensure_timezone(d, timezone)`](#datetime_ensure_timezoned-timezone)[`datetime_set_timezone(d, timezone)`](#datetime_set_timezoned-timezone)[`default_clock()`](#default_clock)[`Delimiter(open, close, *, backslash=False, nested=True)`](#delimiteropen-close--backslashfalse-nestedtrue)[`Event(scheduler, event, time, priority, sequence)`](#eventscheduler-event-time-priority-sequence)[`Event.cancel()`](#eventcancel)[`fgrep(path, text, *, encoding=None, enumerate=False, case_insensitive=False)`](#fgreppath-text--encodingnone-enumeratefalse-case_insensitivefalse)[`file_mtime(path)`](#file_mtimepath)[`file_mtime_ns(path)`](#file_mtime_nspath)[`file_size(path)`](#file_sizepath)[`gently_title(s, *, apostrophes=None, double_quotes=None)`](#gently_titles-apostrophesnone-double_quotesnone)[`get_float(o, default=_sentinel)`](#get_floato-default_sentinel)[`get_int(o, default=_sentinel)`](#get_into-default_sentinel)[`get_int_or_float(o, default=_sentinel)`](#get_int_or_floato-default_sentinel)[`grep(path, pattern, *, encoding=None, enumerate=False, flags=0)`](#greppath-pattern--encodingnone-enumeratefalse-flags0)[`Heap(i=None)`](#heapinone)[`Heap.append(o)`](#heapappendo)[`Heap.clear()`](#heapclear)[`Heap.copy()`](#heapcopy)[`Heap.extend(i)`](#heapextendi)[`Heap.remove(o)`](#heapremoveo)[`Heap.popleft()`](#heappopleft)[`Heap.append_and_popleft(o)`](#heapappend_and_poplefto)[`Heap.popleft_and_append(o)`](#heappopleft_and_append0)[`Heap.queue`](#heapqueue)[`int_to_words(i, flowery=True)`](#int_to_words-flowerytrue)[`lines(s, separators=None, *, line_number=1, column_number=1, tab_width=8, **kwargs)`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs)[`lines_convert_tabs_to_spaces(li)`](#lines_convert_tabs_to_spacesli)[`lines_filter_comment_lines(li, comment_separators)`](#lines_filter_comment_linesli-comment_separators)[`lines_containing(li, s, *, invert=False)`](#lines_containingli-s--invertfalse)[`lines_grep(li, pattern, *, invert=False, flags=0)`](#lines_grepli-pattern--invertfalse-flags0)[`lines_rstrip(li)`](#lines_rstripli)[`lines_sort(li, *, reverse=False)`](#lines_sortli--reversefalse)[`lines_strip(li)`](#lines_stripli)[`lines_strip_comments(li, comment_separators, *, quotes=('&quot;', &quot;'&quot;), backslash='\\', rstrip=True, triple_quotes=True)`](#lines_strip_commentsli-comment_separators--quotes--backslash-rstriptrue-triple_quotestrue)[`lines_strip_indent(li)`](#lines_strip_indentli)[`Log`](#log)[`Log.enter(subsystem)`](#logentersubsystem)[`Log.exit()`](#logexit)[`Log.print(*, print=None, title=&quot;[event log]&quot;, headings=True, indent=2, seconds_width=2, fractional_width=9)`](#logprint--printnone-titleeventlog-headingstrue-indent2-seconds_width2-fractional_width9)[`Log.reset()`](#logreset)[`merge_columns(*columns, column_separator=&quot;

See the[**Bound inner classes**](#bound-inner-classes)deep-dive for more information.#### `BoundInnerClass(cls)`&gt; Class decorator for an inner class.  When accessing the inner class&gt; through an instance of the outer class, &quot;binds&quot; the inner class to&gt; the instance.  This changes the signature of the inner class's `__init__`&gt; from&gt; ```Python&gt; def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):`&gt; ```&gt; to&gt; ```Python&gt; def __init__(self, outer, *args, **kwargs):&gt; ```&gt; where `outer` is the instance of the outer class.&gt;&gt; Note that this has an implication for all subclasses.&gt; If class ***B*** is decorated with `BoundInnerClass`,&gt; and class ***S*** is a subclass of ***B***, such that&gt; `issubclass(`***S***`, `***B***`)`,&gt; class ***S*** *must* be decorated with either&gt; `BoundInnerClass` or `UnboundInnerClass`.#### `UnboundInnerClass(cls)`&gt; Class decorator for an inner class that prevents binding&gt; the inner class to an instance of the outer class.&gt;&gt; If class ***B*** is decorated with `BoundInnerClass`,&gt; and class ***S*** is a subclass of ***B***, such that&gt; `issubclass(`***S***`, `***B***`)` returns `True`,&gt; class ***S*** *must* be decorated with either&gt; `BoundInnerClass` or `UnboundInnerClass`.## `big.builtin`Functions for working with builtins.  (Named `builtin` to avoid aname collision with the `builtins` module.)In general, the idea with these functions is a principle I firstread about in either[Code Complete](http://aroma.vn/web/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/code-complete-2nd-edition-v413hav.pdf)or[Writing Solid Code:](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs190/2008/documents/restricted/Writing%20Solid%20Code.pdf)&gt; *Don't associate with losers.*The intent here is, try to design APIs where it's impossible to call themthe wrong way.  Restrict the inputs to your functions to values you canalways handle, and you won't ever have to return an error.The functions in this sub-module are designed to always work.  None ofthem should ever raise an exception--no matter *what* nonsense you pass in.(But don't take that as a challenge!)#### `get_float(o, default=_sentinel)`&gt; Returns `float(o)`, unless that conversion fails,&gt; in which case returns the default value.  If&gt; you don't pass in an explicit default value,&gt; the default value is `o`.#### `get_int(o, default=_sentinel)`&gt; Returns `int(o)`, unless that conversion fails,&gt; in which case returns the default value.  If&gt; you don't pass in an explicit default value,&gt; the default value is `o`.#### `get_int_or_float(o, default=_sentinel)`&gt; Converts `o` into a number, preferring an int to a float.&gt;&gt; If `o` is already an int or float, returns `o` unchanged.  Otherwise,&gt; tries `int(o)`.  If that conversion succeeds, returns the result.&gt; Otherwise, tries `float(o)`.  If that conversion succeeds, returns&gt; the result.  Otherwise returns the default value.  If you don't&gt; pass in an explicit default value, the default value is `o`.#### `try_float(o)`&gt; Returns `True` if `o` can be converted into a `float`,&gt; and `False` if it can't.#### `try_int(o)`&gt; Returns `True` if `o` can be converted into an `int`,&gt; and `False` if it can't.## `big.file`Functions for working with files, directories, and I/O.#### `fgrep(path, text, *, encoding=None, enumerate=False, case_insensitive=False)`&gt; Find the lines of a file that match some text, like the UNIX `fgrep` utility&gt; program.&gt;&gt; `path` should be an object representing a path to an existing file, one of:&gt;&gt; * a string,&gt; * a bytes object, or&gt; * a `pathlib.Path` object.&gt;&gt; `text` should be either string or bytes.&gt;&gt; `encoding` is used as the file encoding when opening the file.&gt;&gt; * If `text` is a str, the file is opened in text mode.&gt; * If `text` is a bytes object, the file is opened in binary mode.&gt;   `encoding` must be `None` when the file is opened in binary mode.&gt;&gt; If `case_insensitive` is true, perform the search in a case-insensitive&gt; manner.&gt;&gt; Returns a list of lines in the file containing `text`.  The lines are either&gt; strings or bytes objects, depending on the type of `pattern`.  The lines&gt; have their newlines stripped but preserve all other whitespace.&gt;&gt; If `enumerate` is true, returns a list of tuples of (line_number, line).&gt; The first line of the file is line number 1.&gt;&gt; For simplicity of implementation, the entire file is read in to memory&gt; at one time.  If `case_insensitive` is true, `fgrep` also makes a lowercased&gt; copy.#### `file_mtime(path)`&gt; Returns the modification time of `path`, in seconds since the epoch.&gt; Note that seconds is a float, indicating the sub-second with some&gt; precision.#### `file_mtime_ns(path)`&gt; Returns the modification time of `path`, in nanoseconds since the epoch.#### `file_size(path)`&gt; Returns the size of the file at `path`, as an integer representing the&gt; number of bytes.#### `grep(path, pattern, *, encoding=None, enumerate=False, flags=0)`&gt; Look for matches to a regular expression pattern in the lines of a file,&gt; similarly to the UNIX `grep` utility program.&gt;&gt; `path` should be an object representing a path to an existing file, one of:&gt;&gt; * a string,&gt; * a bytes object, or&gt; * a `pathlib.Path` object.&gt;&gt; `pattern` should be an object containing a regular expression, one of:&gt; * a string,&gt; * a bytes object, or&gt; * an `re.Pattern`, initialized with either `str` or `bytes`.&gt;&gt; `encoding` is used as the file encoding when opening the file.&gt;&gt; if `pattern` uses a `str`, the file is opened in text mode.&gt; if `pattern` uses a bytes object, the file is opened in binary mode.&gt; `encoding` must be `None` when the file is opened in binary mode.&gt;&gt; `flags` is passed in as the `flags` argument to `re.compile` if `pattern`&gt; is a string or bytes.  (It's ignored if `pattern` is an `re.Pattern` object.)&gt;&gt; Returns a list of lines in the file matching the pattern.  The lines&gt; are either strings or bytes objects, depending on the type of `text`.&gt; The lines have their newlines stripped but preserve all other whitespace.&gt;&gt; If `enumerate` is true, returns a list of tuples of `(line_number, line)`.&gt; The first line of the file is line number 1.&gt;&gt; For simplicity of implementation, the entire file is read in to memory&gt; at one time.&gt;&gt; Tip: to perform a case-insensitive pattern match, pass in the&gt; `re.IGNORECASE` flag into flags for this function (if pattern is a string&gt; or bytes) or when creating your regular expression object (if pattern is&gt; an `re.Pattern` object.&gt;&gt; (In older versions of Python, `re.Pattern` was a private type called&gt; `re._pattern_type`.)#### `pushd(directory)`&gt; A context manager that temporarily changes the directory.&gt; Example:&gt;&gt; ```Python&gt; with big.pushd('x'):&gt;     pass&gt; ````&gt;&gt; This would change into the `'x'` subdirectory before&gt; executing the nested block, then change back to&gt; the original directory after the nested block.&gt;&gt; You can change directories in the nested block;&gt; this won't affect pushd restoring the original current&gt; working directory upon exiting the nested block.&gt;&gt; You can safely nest `with pushd` blocks.#### `safe_mkdir(path)`&gt; Ensures that a directory exists at `path`.&gt; If this function returns and doesn't raise,&gt; it guarantees that a directory exists at `path`.&gt;&gt; If a directory already exists at `path`,&gt; `safe_mkdir` does nothing.&gt;&gt; If a file exists at `path`, `safe_mkdir`&gt; unlinks `path` then creates the directory.&gt;&gt; If the parent directory doesn't exist,&gt; `safe_mkdir` creates that directory,&gt; then creates `path`.&gt;&gt; This function can still fail:&gt;&gt; * `path` could be on a read-only filesystem.&gt; * You might lack the permissions to create `path`.&gt; * You could ask to create the directory `x/y`&gt;   and `x` is a file (not a directory).#### `safe_unlink(path)`&gt; Unlinks `path`, if `path` exists and is a file.#### `touch(path)`&gt; Ensures that `path` exists, and its modification time is the current time.&gt;&gt; If `path` does not exist, creates an empty file.&gt;&gt; If `path` exists, updates its modification time to the current time.#### `translate_filename_to_exfat(s)`&gt; Ensures that all characters in s are legal for a FAT filesystem.&gt;&gt; Returns a copy of `s` where every character not allowed in a FAT&gt; filesystem filename has been replaced with a character (or characters)&gt; that are permitted.#### `translate_filename_to_unix(s)`&gt; Ensures that all characters in s are legal for a UNIX filesystem.&gt;&gt; Returns a copy of `s` where every character not allowed in a UNIX&gt; filesystem filename has been replaced with a character (or characters)&gt; that are permitted.## `big.graph`A drop-in replacement for Python's[`graphlib.TopologicalSorter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/graphlib.html#graphlib.TopologicalSorter)with an enhanced API.  This version of `TopologicalSorter` allows modifying thegraph at any time, and supports multiple simultaneous *views,* allowingiteration over the graph more than once.See the [**Enhanced `TopologicalSorter`**](#enhanced-topologicalsorter) deep-dive for more information.#### `CycleError`&gt; Exception thrown by `TopologicalSorter` when it detects a cycle.#### `TopologicalSorter(graph=None)`&gt; An object representing a directed graph of nodes.  See Python's&gt; [`graphlib.TopologicalSorter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/graphlib.html#graphlib.TopologicalSorter)&gt; for concepts and the basic API.New methods on `TopologicalSorter`:#### `TopologicalSorter.copy()`&gt; Returns a shallow copy of the graph.  The copy also duplicates&gt; the state of `get_ready` and `done`.#### `TopologicalSorter.cycle()`&gt; Checks the graph for cycles.  If no cycles exist, returns None.&gt; If at least one cycle exists, returns a tuple containing nodes&gt; that constitute a cycle.#### `TopologicalSorter.print(print=print)`&gt; Prints the internal state of the graph.  Used for debugging.&gt;&gt; `print` is the function used for printing;&gt; it should behave identically to the builtin `print` function.#### `TopologicalSorter.remove(node)`&gt; Remove `node` from the graph.&gt;&gt; If any node `P` depends on a node `N`, and `N` is removed,&gt; this dependency is also removed, but `P` is not&gt; removed from the graph.&gt;&gt; remove() works but it's slow (O(N)).&gt; TopologicalSorter is optimized for fast adds and fast views.#### `TopologicalSorter.reset()`Resets `get_ready` and `done` to their initial state.#### `TopologicalSorter.view()`&gt; Returns a new `View` object on this graph.#### `TopologicalSorter.View`&gt; A view on a `TopologicalSorter` graph object.&gt; Allows iterating over the nodes of the graph&gt; in dependency order.Methods on a `View` object:#### `TopologicalSorter.View.__bool__()`&gt; Returns `True` if more work can be done in the&gt; view--if there are nodes waiting to be yielded by&gt; `get_ready`, or waiting to be returned by `done`.&gt;&gt; Aliased to `TopologicalSorter.is_active` for compatibility&gt; with graphlib.#### `TopologicalSorter.View.close()`&gt; Closes the view.  A closed view can no longer be used.#### `TopologicalSorter.View.copy()`&gt; Returns a shallow copy of the view, duplicating its current state.#### `TopologicalSorter.View.done(*nodes)`&gt; Marks nodes returned by `ready` as &quot;done&quot;,&gt; possibly allowing additional nodes to be available&gt; from `ready`.#### `TopologicalSorter.View.print(print=print)`&gt; Prints the internal state of the view, and its graph.&gt; Used for debugging.&gt;&gt; `print` is the function used for printing;&gt; it should behave identically to the builtin `print` function.#### `TopologicalSorter.View.ready()`&gt; Returns a tuple of &quot;ready&quot; nodes--nodes with no&gt; predecessors, or nodes whose predecessors have all&gt; been marked &quot;done&quot;.&gt;&gt; Aliased to `TopologicalSorter.get_ready` for&gt; compatibility with `graphlib`.#### `TopologicalSorter.View.reset()`&gt; Resets the view to its initial state,&gt; forgetting all &quot;ready&quot; and &quot;done&quot; state.## `big.heap`Functions for working with heap objects.Well, just one heap object really.#### `Heap(i=None)`&gt; An object-oriented wrapper around the `heapq` library, designed to be&gt; easy to use--and easy to remember how to use.  The `heapq` library&gt; implements a [binary heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap),&gt; a data structure used for sorting;&gt; you add objects to the heap, and you can then remove&gt; objects in sorted order.  Heaps are useful because they have are efficient&gt; both in space and in time; they're also inflexible, in that iterating over&gt; the sorted items is destructive.&gt;&gt; Big's `Heap` API mimics the `list` and `collections.deque` objects;&gt; this way, all you need to remember is &quot;it works kinda like a `list` object&quot;.&gt; You `append` new items to the heap, then `popleft` them off in sorted order.&gt;&gt; By default `Heap` creates an empty heap.  If you pass in an iterable `i`&gt; to the constructor, this is equivalent to calling the `extend(i)` on the&gt; freshly-constructed `Heap`.&gt;&gt; In addition to the below methods, `Heap` objects support iteration,&gt; `len`, the `in` operator, and use as a boolean expression.  You can&gt; also index or slice into a `Heap` object, which behaves as if the&gt; heap is a list of objects in sorted order.  Getting the first item&gt; (`Heap[0]`, aka *peek*) is cheap, the other operations can get very&gt; expensive.&gt;&gt; Methods on a `Heap` object:#### `Heap.append(o)`&gt; Adds object `o` to the heap.#### `Heap.clear()`&gt; Removes all objects from the heap,&gt; resetting it to empty.#### `Heap.copy()`&gt; Returns a shallow copy of the heap.&gt; Only duplicates the heap data structures itself;&gt; does not duplicate the objects *in* the heap.#### `Heap.extend(i)`&gt; Adds all the objects from the iterable `i` to the heap.#### `Heap.remove(o)`&gt; If object `o` is in the heap, removes it.  If `o` is not&gt; in the heap, raises `ValueError`.#### `Heap.popleft()`&gt; If the heap is not empty, returns the first item in the&gt; heap in sorted order.  If the heap is empty, raises `IndexError`.#### `Heap.append_and_popleft(o)`&gt; Equivalent to calling `Heap.append(o)` immediately followed&gt; by `Heap.popleft()`.  If `o` is smaller than any other object&gt; in the heap at the time it's added, this will return `o`.#### `Heap.popleft_and_append(o)`&gt; Equivalent to calling `Heap.popleft()` immediately followed&gt; by `Heap.append(o)`.  This method will *never* return `o`,&gt; unless `o` was already in the heap before the method was called.#### `Heap.queue`&gt; Not a method, a property.  Returns a copy of the contents&gt; of the heap, in sorted order.## `big.itertools`Functions and classes for working with iteration.Only one entry so far.#### `PushbackIterator(iterable=None)`&gt; Wraps any iterator, allowing you to push items back on the iterator.&gt; This allows you to &quot;peek&quot; at the next item (or items); you can get the&gt; next item, examine it, and then push it back.  If any objects have&gt; been pushed onto the iterator, they are yielded first, before attempting&gt; to yield from the wrapped iterator.&gt;&gt; Pass in any `iterable` to the constructor.  Passing in an `iterable`&gt; of `None` means the `PushbackIterator` is created in an exhausted state.&gt;&gt; When the wrapped `iterable` is exhausted (or if you passed in `None`&gt; to the constructor) you can still call push to add new items, at which&gt; point the `PushBackIterator` can be iterated over again.&gt;&gt; In addition to the following methods, `PushbackIterator` supports&gt; the iterator protocol and testing for truth.  A `PushbackIterator`&gt; is true if iterating over it will yield at least one value.#### `PushbackIterator.next(default=None)`&gt; Equivalent to `next(PushbackIterator)`,&gt; but won't raise `StopIteration`.&gt; If the iterator is exhausted, returns&gt; the `default` argument.#### `PushbackIterator.push(o)`&gt; Pushes a value into the iterator's internal stack.&gt; When a `PushbackIterator` is iterated over, and there are&gt; any pushed values, the top value on the stack will be popped&gt; and yielded.  `PushbackIterator` only yields from the&gt; iterator it wraps when this internal stack is empty.## `big.log`A simple and lightweight logging class, useful for performance analysis.Not intended as a full-fledged logging facility like Python's[`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) module.#### `default_clock()`&gt; The default clock function used by the `Log` class.&gt; This function returns elapsed time in nanoseconds,&gt; expressed as an integer.&gt;&gt; In Python 3.7+,&gt; this is `time.monotonic_ns`; in Python 3.6 this is&gt; a custom function that calls `time.perf_counter`,&gt; then converts that time to requisite format.#### `Log(*, clock=None)`&gt; A simple and lightweight logging class, useful for performance analysis.&gt; Not intended as a full-fledged logging facility like Python's&gt; [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) module.&gt;&gt; Allows nesting, which is literally just a presentation thing.&gt;&gt; The `clock` named parameter specifies the function the `Log` object&gt; should call to get the time.  This function should return an `int`,&gt; representing elapsed time in nanoseconds.&gt;&gt; To use: first, create your `Log` object.&gt;&gt;     log = Log()&gt;&gt; Then log events by calling your `Log` object, passing in&gt; a string describing the event.&gt;&gt;     log('text')&gt;&gt; Enter a nested subsystem containing events with log.enter:&gt;&gt;     log.enter('subsystem')&gt;&gt; Then later exit that subsystem with log.exit:&gt;&gt;     log.exit()&gt;&gt; And finally print the log:&gt;&gt;     log.print()&gt;&gt; You can also iterate over the log events using `iter(log)`.&gt; This yields 4-tuples:&gt;&gt;     (start_time, elapsed_time, event, depth)#### `Log.enter(subsystem)`&gt; Notifies the log that you've entered a subsystem.&gt; The `subsystem` parameter should be a string describing the subsystem.&gt;&gt; This is really just a presentation&gt; thing; all subsequent logged entries will be indented&gt; until you make the corresponding `log.exit()` call.&gt;&gt; You may nest subsystems as deeply as you like.#### `Log.exit()`&gt; Exits a logged subsystem.  See [`Log.enter.`](#logentersubsystem)#### `Log.print(*, print=None, title=&quot;[event log]&quot;, headings=True, indent=2, seconds_width=2, fractional_width=9)`&gt; Prints the log.&gt;&gt; Keyword-only parameters:&gt;&gt; `print` specifies the print function to use, default is `builtins.print`.&gt;&gt; `title` specifies the title to print at the beginning.&gt; Default is `&quot;[event log]&quot;`.  To suppress, pass in `None`.&gt;&gt; `headings` is a boolean; if `True` (the default),&gt; prints column headings for the log.&gt;&gt; `indent` is the number of spaces to indent in front of log entries,&gt; and also how many spaces to indent each time we enter a subsystem.&gt;&gt; `seconds_width` is how wide to make the seconds column, default 2.&gt;&gt; `fractional_width` is how wide to make the fractional column, default 9.#### `Log.reset()`&gt; Resets the log to its initial state.## `big.scheduler`&gt; A replacement for Python's `sched.scheduler` object,&gt; adding full threading support and a modern Python interface.&gt;&gt; Python's `sched.scheduler` object was a clever idea for the&gt; time.  It abstracted away the concept of time from its interface,&gt; allowing it to be adapted to new schemes of measuring time--including&gt; mock time used for testing.  Very nice!&gt;&gt; But unfortunately, `sched.scheduler` was designed in 1991--long&gt; before multithreading was common, years before threading support&gt; was added to Python.  Sadly its API isn't flexible enough to&gt; correctly handle some scenarios:&gt;&gt; * If one thread has called `sched.scheduler.run`,&gt;   and the next scheduled event will occur at time **T**,&gt;   and a second thread schedules a new event which&gt;   occurs at a time &lt; **T**, `sched.scheduler.run` won't&gt;   return any events to the first thread until time **T**.&gt; * If one thread has called `sched.scheduler.run`,&gt;   and the next scheduled event will occur at time **T**,&gt;   and a second thread cancels all events,&gt;   `sched.scheduler.run` won't exit until time **T**.&gt;&gt; Also, `sched.scheduler` is thirty years behind the times in&gt; Python API design--its design predates many common modern&gt; Python conventions.  Its events are callbacks, which it&gt; calls directly.  `Scheduler` fixes this: its events are&gt; objects, and you iterate over the `Scheduler` object to receive&gt; events as they become due.&gt;&gt; `Scheduler` also benefits from thirty years of improvements&gt; to `sched.scheduler`.  In particular, big reimplements the&gt; bulk of the `sched.scheduler` test suite, to ensure that&gt; `Scheduler` never repeats the historical problems discovered&gt; over the lifetime of `sched.scheduler`.#### `Event(scheduler, event, time, priority, sequence)`&gt; An object representing a scheduled event in a `Scheduler`.&gt; You shouldn't need to create them manually; `Event` objects&gt; are created automatically when you add events to a `Scheduler`.&gt;&gt; Supports one method:#### `Event.cancel()`&gt; Cancels this event.  If this event has already been canceled,&gt; raises `ValueError`.#### `Regulator()`&gt; An abstract base class for `Scheduler` regulators.&gt;&gt; A &quot;regulator&quot; handles all the details about time&gt; for a `Scheduler`.  `Scheduler` objects don't actually&gt; understand time; it's all abstracted away by the&gt; `Regulator`.&gt;&gt; You can implement your own `Regulator` and use it&gt; with `Scheduler`.  Your `Regulator` subclass needs to&gt; implement a minimum of three methods: `now`,&gt; `sleep`, and `wake`.  It must also provide an&gt; attribute called 'lock'.  The lock must implement&gt; the context manager protocol, and should ensure thread&gt; safety for the `Regulator`.  (`Scheduler` will only&gt; request the `Regulator`'s lock if it's not already&gt; holding it.  Put another way, the `Regulator` doesn't&gt; need to be a &quot;reentrant&quot; lock, aka a &quot;recursive&quot; lock.)&gt;&gt; Normally a `Regulator` represents time using&gt; a floating-point number, representing a fractional&gt; number of seconds since some epoch.  But this&gt; isn't strictly necessary.  Any Python object that&gt; fulfills these requirements will work:&gt;&gt; * The time class must implement `__le__`, `__eq__`, `__add__`,&gt; and `__sub__`, and these operations must be consistent in the&gt; same way they are for number objects.&gt; * If `a` and `b` are instances of the time class,&gt; and `a.__le__(b)` is true, then `a` must either be&gt; an earlier time, or a smaller interval of time.&gt; * The time class must also implement rich comparison&gt; with numbers (integers and floats), and `0` must&gt; represent both the earliest time and a zero-length&gt; interval of time.#### `Regulator.now()`&gt; Returns the current time in local units.&gt; Must be monotonically increasing; for any&gt; two calls to now during the course of the&gt; program, the later call must *never*&gt; have a lower value than the earlier call.&gt;&gt; A `Scheduler` will only call this method while&gt; holding this regulator's lock.#### `Regulator.sleep(t)`&gt; Sleeps for some amount of time, in local units.&gt; Must support an interval of `0`, which should&gt; represent not sleeping.  (Though it's preferable&gt; that an interval of `0` yields the rest of the&gt; current thread's remaining time slice back to&gt; the operating system.)&gt;&gt; If `wake` is called on this `Regulator` object while a&gt; different thread has called this function to sleep,&gt; `sleep` must abandon the rest of the sleep interval&gt; and return immediately.&gt;&gt; A `Scheduler` will only call this method while&gt; *not* holding this regulator's lock.#### `Regulator.wake()`&gt; Aborts all current calls to `sleep` on this&gt; `Regulator`, across all threads.&gt;&gt; A `Scheduler` will only call this method while&gt; holding this regulator's lock.#### `Scheduler(regulator=default_regulator)`&gt; Implements a scheduler.  The only argument is the&gt; &quot;regulator&quot; object to use; the regulator abstracts away all&gt; time-related details for the scheduler.  By default `Scheduler`&gt; uses an instance of `SingleThreadedRegulator`,&gt; which is not thread-safe.&gt;&gt; (If you need the scheduler to be thread-safe, pass in an&gt; instance of a thread-safe `Regulator` class like&gt; `ThreadSafeRegulator`.)&gt;&gt; In addition to the below methods, `Scheduler` objects support&gt; being evaluated in a boolean context (they are true if they&gt; contain any events), and they support being iterated over.&gt; Iterating over a `Scheduler` object blocks until the next&gt; event comes due, at which point the `Scheduler` yields that&gt; event.  An empty `Scheduler` that is iterated over raises&gt; `StopIteration`.  You can reuse `Scheduler` objects, iterating&gt; over them until empty, then adding more objects and iterating&gt; over them again.#### `Scheduler.schedule(o, time, *, absolute=False, priority=DEFAULT_PRIORITY)`&gt; Schedules an object `o` to be yielded as an event by this `schedule` object&gt; at some time in the future.&gt;&gt; By default the `time` value is a relative time value,&gt; and is added to the current time; using a `time` value of 0&gt; should schedule this event to be yielded immediately.&gt;&gt; If `absolute` is true, `time` is regarded as an absolute time value.&gt;&gt; If multiple events are scheduled for the same time, they will&gt; be yielded by order of `priority`.  Lowever values of&gt; `priority` represent higher priorities.  The default value&gt; is `Scheduler.DEFAULT_PRIORITY`, which is 100.  If two events&gt; are scheduled for the same time, and have the same priority,&gt; `Scheduler` will yield the events in the order they were added.&gt;&gt; Returns an `Event` object, which can be used to cancel the event.#### `Scheduler.cancel(event)`&gt; Cancels a scheduled event.  `event` must be an object&gt; returned by this `Scheduler` object.  If `event` is not&gt; currently scheduled in this `Scheduler` object,&gt; raises `ValueError`.#### `Scheduler.queue`&gt; A list of the currently scheduled `Event` objects,&gt; in the order they will be yielded.#### `Scheduler.non_blocking()`&gt; Returns an iterator for the events in the&gt; `Scheduler` that only yields the events that&gt; are currently due.  Never blocks; if the next&gt; event is not due yet, raises `StopIteration`.### `SingleThreadedRegulator()`&gt; An implementation of `Regulator` designed for&gt; use in single-threaded programs.  It doesn't support&gt; multiple threads, and in particular is not thread-safe.&gt; But it's much higher performance&gt; than thread-safe `Regulator` implementations.&gt;&gt; This `Regulator` isn't guaranteed to be safe&gt; for use while in a signal-handler callback.### `ThreadSafeRegulator()`&gt; A thread-safe implementation of `Regulator`&gt; designed for use in multithreaded programs.&gt;&gt; This `Regulator` isn't guaranteed to be safe&gt; for use while in a signal-handler callback.## `big.text`Functions for working with text strings.  There areseveral families of functions inside the `text` module;for a higher-level view of those families, read thefollowing deep-dives:* [**The `multi-` family of functions**](#The-multi--family-of-functions)* [**`lines` and lines modifier functions**](#lines-and-lines-modifier-functions)* [**Word wrapping and formatting**](#word-wrapping-and-formatting)All the functions in `big.text` will work with either`str` or `bytes` objects, except the three[**Word wrapping and formatting**](#word-wrapping-and-formatting)functions.  When working with `bytes`,by default the functions will only work with ASCIIcharacters.#### Support for bytes and strThe **big** text functions all support both `str` and `bytes`.The functions all automatically detect whether you passed in`str` or `bytes`  using anintentionally simple and predictable process, as follows:At the start of each function, it'll test its first &quot;string&quot;argument to see if it's a `bytes` object.```Pythonis_bytes = isinstance(&lt;argument&gt;, bytes)```If `isinstance` returns `True`, the function assumes all arguments are`bytes` objects.  Otherwise the function assumes all argumentsare `str` objects.As a rule, no further further testing, casting, or catching exceptionsis done.Functions that take multiple string-like parameters require allsuch arguments to be the same type.These functions will check that all such argumentsare of the same type.Subclasses of `str` and `bytes` will also work; anywhere youshould pass in a `str`, you can also pass in a subclass of`str`, and likewise for `bytes`.#### `Delimiter(open, close, *, backslash=False, nested=True)`&gt; Class representing a delimiter for&gt; [`parse_delimiters`.](#parse_delimiterss-delimitersNone)&gt;&gt; `open` is the opening delimiter character, can be `str` or `bytes`, must be length 1.&gt;&gt; `close` is the closing delimiter character, must be the same type as `open`, and length 1.&gt;&gt; `backslash` is a boolean: when inside this delimiter, can you escape delimiters&gt; with a backslash?  (You usually can inside single or double quotes.)&gt;&gt; `nested` is a boolean: must other delimiters nest in this delimiter?&gt; (Delimiters don't usually need to be nested inside single and double quotes.)#### `gently_title(s, *, apostrophes=None, double_quotes=None)`&gt; Uppercase the first character of every word in `s`.&gt; Leave the other letters alone.  s should be `str` or `bytes`.&gt;&gt; (For the purposes of this algorithm, words are&gt; any blob of non-whitespace characters.)&gt;&gt; Capitalize the letter after an apostrophe if&gt;&gt; * the apostrophe is after whitespace or a&gt; left parenthesis character (`'('`)&gt; (or is the first letter of the string), or&gt;&gt; * if the apostrophe is after a letter O or D,&gt; and that O or D is after whitespace (or is&gt; the first letter of the string).  The O or D&gt; here will also be capitalized.&gt;&gt; The first rule handles internally quoted strings:&gt;&gt;     He Said 'No I Did Not'&gt;&gt; and contractions that start with an apostrophe&gt;&gt;     'Twas The Night Before Christmas&gt;&gt; And the second rule handles certain Irish, French,&gt; and Italian names.&gt;&gt;     Peter O'Toole&gt;     Lord D'Arcy&gt;&gt; Capitalize the letter after a quote mark if&gt; the quote mark is after whitespace (or is the&gt; first letter of a string).&gt;&gt; A run of consecutive apostrophes and/or&gt; quote marks is considered one quote mark for&gt; the purposes of capitalization.&gt;&gt; If specified, `apostrophes` should be a `str`&gt; or `bytes` object containing characters that&gt; should be considered apostrophes.  If `apostrophes`&gt; is false, and `s` is `bytes`, `apostrophes` is set to `&quot;'&quot;`.&gt; If `apostrophes` is false and s is `str`, `apostrophes`&gt; is set to a string containing these Unicode apostrophe code points:&gt;     '‘’‚‛&gt;&gt; If specified, `double_quotes` should be a `str`&gt; or `bytes` object containing characters that&gt; should be considered double-quote characters.&gt; If `double_quotes` is false, and `s` is `bytes`,&gt; `double_quotes` is set to &quot;'&quot;.&gt; If `double_quotes` is false and `s` is `str`, double_quotes&gt; is set to a string containing these Unicode double quote code points:&gt;     &quot;“”„‟«»‹›#### `int_to_words(i, flowery=True)`&gt; Converts an integer into the equivalent English string.&gt;&gt;     int_to_words(2) -&gt; &quot;two&quot;&gt;     int_to_words(35) -&gt; &quot;thirty-five&quot;&gt;&gt; If the keyword-only parameter `flowery` is true (the default),&gt; you also get commas and the word `and` where you'd expect them.&gt; (When `flowery` is true, `int_to_words(i)` produces identical&gt; output to `inflect.engine().number_to_words(i)`, except for&gt; negative numbers: `inflect` starts negative numbers with&gt; &quot;minus&quot;, **big** starts them with &quot;negative&quot;.)&gt; Numbers &gt;= `10**66` (one thousand vigintillion)&gt; are only converted using `str(i)`.  Sorry!#### `lines(s, separators=None, *, line_number=1, column_number=1, tab_width=8, **kwargs)`&gt; A &quot;lines iterator&quot; object.  Splits s into lines, and iterates yielding those lines.&gt;&gt; `s` can be `str`, `bytes`, or any iterable of `str` or `bytes`.&gt;&gt; If `s` is neither `str` nor `bytes`, `s` must be an iterable;&gt; `lines` yields successive elements of `s` as lines.  All objects&gt; yielded by this iterable should be homogeneous, either `str` or `bytes`.&gt;&gt; If `s` is `str` or `bytes`, and `separators` is `None`, `lines`&gt; will split `s` at line boundaries and yield those lines, including&gt; empty lines.  If `separators` is not `None`, it must be an iterable&gt; of strings of the same type as `s`; `lines` will split `s` using&gt; [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse).&gt;&gt; When iterated over, yields 2-tuples:&gt;     (info, line)&gt;&gt; `info` is a `LineInfo` object, which contains three fields by&gt; default:&gt;&gt; * `line` - the original line, never modified&gt; * `line_number` - the line number of this line, starting at the&gt; `line_number` passed in and adding 1 for each successive line&gt; * `column_number` - the column this line starts on,&gt; starting at the `column_number` passed in, and adjusted when&gt; characters are removed from the beginning of `line`&gt;&gt; `tab_width` is not used by `lines` itself, but is stored&gt; internally and may be used by other lines modifier functions&gt; (e.g. `lines_convert_tabs_to_spaces`, `lines_strip_indent`).&gt; Similarly, all keyword arguments passed in via `kwargs` are&gt; stored internally and can be accessed by user-defined lines&gt; modifier functions.&gt;&gt; For more information, see the deep-dive on&gt; [**`lines` and lines modifier functions.**](#lines-and-lines-modifier-functions)#### `LineInfo(line, line_number, column_number, **kwargs)`&gt; The second object yielded by a&gt; [`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs)&gt; iterator, containing metadata about the line.&gt; You can add your own fields by passing them in&gt; via `**kwargs`; you can also add new attributes&gt; or modify existing attributes as needed from&gt; inside a &quot;lines modifier&quot; function.&gt;&gt; For more information, see the deep-dive on&gt; [**`lines` and lines modifier functions.**](#lines-and-lines-modifier-functions)#### `lines_convert_tabs_to_spaces(li)`&gt; A lines modifier function.

Example:&gt;&gt;     multipartition('aXbYz', ('X', 'Y')) =&gt; ('a', 'X', 'bYz')&gt;&gt; If none of the separators are found in the string, returns&gt; a tuple containing `s` unchanged followed by two empty strings.&gt;&gt; `multipartition` is *greedy:* if two or more separators appear at&gt; the leftmost location in `s`, `multipartition` partitions using&gt; the longest matching separator.  For example:&gt;&gt;     big.multipartition('wxabcyz', ('a', 'abc')) =&gt; `('wx', 'abc', 'yz')`&gt;&gt; Passing in an explicit `count` lets you control how many times&gt; `multipartition` partitions the string.  `multipartition` will always&gt; return a tuple containing `(2*count)+1` elements.&gt; Passing in a `count` of 0 will always return a tuple containing `s`.&gt;&gt; If `separate` is true, multiple adjacent separator strings behave&gt; like one separator.  Example:&gt;&gt;     big.text.multipartition('aXYbYXc', ('X', 'Y',), count=2, separate=False) =&gt; ('a', 'XY', 'b', 'YX', 'c')&gt;     big.text.multipartition('aXYbYXc', ('X', 'Y',), count=2, separate=True ) =&gt; ('a', 'X', '', 'Y', 'bYXc')&gt;&gt; If `reverse` is true, multipartition behaves like `str.rpartition`.&gt; It partitions starting on the right, scanning backwards through s&gt; looking for separators.&gt;&gt; For more information, see the deep-dive on&gt; [**The `multi-` family of functions.**](#The-multi--family-of-functions)#### `multisplit(s, separators, *, keep=False, maxsplit=-1, reverse=False, separate=False, strip=False)`&gt; Splits strings like `str.split`, but with multiple separators and options.&gt;&gt; `s` can be `str` or `bytes`.&gt;&gt; `separators` should be an iterable of `str` or `bytes`, matching `s`.&gt;&gt; Returns an iterator yielding the strings split from `s`.  If `keep`&gt; is true (or `ALTERNATING`), and `strip` is false, joining these strings&gt; together will recreate `s`.&gt;&gt; `multisplit` is *greedy:* if two or more separators start at the same&gt; location in `s`, `multisplit` splits using the longest matching separator.&gt; For example:&gt;&gt;     big.multisplit('wxabcyz', ('a', 'abc'))&gt;&gt; yields `'wx'` then `'yz'`.&gt;&gt; `keep` indicates whether or not multisplit should preserve the separator&gt; strings in the strings it yields.  It supports four values:&gt;&gt;       false (the default)&gt;            Discard the separators.&gt;       true (apart from ALTERNATING and AS_PAIRS)&gt;            Append the separators to the end of the split strings.&gt;            You can recreate the original string by passing the&gt;            list returned in to &quot;&quot;.join .&gt;       ALTERNATING&gt;            Yield alternating strings in the output: strings consisting&gt;            of separators, alternating with strings consisting of&gt;            non-separators.  If &quot;separate&quot; is true, separator strings&gt;            will contain exactly one separator, and non-separator strings&gt;            may be empty; if &quot;separate&quot; is false, separator strings will&gt;            contain one or more separators, and non-separator strings&gt;            will never be empty, unless &quot;s&quot; was empty.&gt;            You can recreate the original string by passing the&gt;            list returned in to &quot;&quot;.join .&gt;       AS_PAIRS&gt;            Yield 2-tuples containing a non-separator string and its&gt;            subsequent separator string.  Either string may be empty;&gt;            the separator string in the last 2-tuple will always be&gt;            empty, and if &quot;s&quot; ends with a separator string, *both*&gt;            strings in the final 2-tuple will be empty.&gt;&gt; `separate` indicates whether multisplit should consider adjacent&gt; separator strings in `s` as one separator or as multiple separators&gt; each separated by a zero-length string.  It supports two values:&gt;&gt;        false (the default)&gt;            Multiple adjacent separators should behave as if they&gt;            are one big separator.&gt;        true&gt;            Don't group separators together.  Each separator should&gt;            split the string individually, even if there are no&gt;            characters between two separators.&gt;&gt; `strip` indicates whether multisplit should strip separators from&gt; the beginning and/or end of `s`.  It supports six values:&gt;&gt;        false (the default)&gt;            Don't strip separators from the beginning or end of &quot;s&quot;.&gt;        true (apart from LEFT, RIGHT, and PROGRESSIVE)&gt;            Strip separators from the beginning and end of &quot;s&quot;&gt;            (similarly to `str.strip`).&gt;        LEFT&gt;            Strip separators only from the beginning of &quot;s&quot;&gt;            (similarly to `str.lstrip`).&gt;        RIGHT&gt;            Strip separators only from the end of &quot;s&quot;&gt;            (similarly to `str.rstrip`).&gt;        PROGRESSIVE&gt;            Strip from the beginning and end of &quot;s&quot;, unless &quot;maxsplit&quot;&gt;            is nonzero and the entire string is not split.  If&gt;            splitting stops due to &quot;maxsplit&quot; before the entire string&gt;            is split, and &quot;reverse&quot; is false, don't strip the end of&gt;            the string. If splitting stops due to &quot;maxsplit&quot; before&gt;            the entire string is split, and &quot;reverse&quot; is true, don't&gt;            strip the beginning of the string.  (This is how str.strip&gt;            and str.rstrip behave when you pass in sep=None .)&gt;&gt; `maxsplit` should be either an integer or `None`.  If `maxsplit` is an&gt; integer greater than -1, multisplit will split `text` no more than&gt; `maxsplit` times.&gt;&gt; `reverse` changes where `multisplit` starts splitting the string, and&gt; what direction it moves through the string when parsing.&gt;&gt;        false (the default)&gt;            Start splitting from the beginning of the string&gt;            and parse moving right (towards the end).&gt;        true&gt;            Start splitting from the end of the string and&gt;            parse moving left (towards the beginning).&gt;&gt;    Splitting starting from the end of the string and parsing to&gt;    the left has two effects.  First, if `maxsplit` is a number&gt;    greater than 0, the splits will start at the end of the string&gt;    rather than the beginning.  Second, if there are overlapping&gt;    instances of separators in the string, `multisplit` will prefer&gt;    the rightmost separator rather than the left.  Consider this&gt;    example, where `reverse` is false:&gt;&gt;        multisplit(&quot;A x x Z&quot;, (&quot; x &quot;,), keep=big.ALTERNATING) =&gt; &quot;A&quot;, &quot; x &quot;, &quot;x Z&quot;&gt;&gt;    If you pass in a true value for `reverse`, `multisplit` will prefer&gt;    the rightmost overlapping separator:&gt;&gt;        multisplit(&quot;A x x Z&quot;, (&quot; x &quot;,), keep=big.ALTERNATING, reverse=True) =&gt; &quot;A x&quot;, &quot; x &quot;, &quot;Z&quot;&gt;&gt; For more information, see the deep-dive on&gt; [**The `multi-` family of functions.**](#The-multi--family-of-functions)#### `multistrip(s, separators, left=True, right=True)`&gt; Like `str.strip`, but supports stripping multiple substrings from `s`.&gt;&gt; Strips from the string `s` all leading and trailing instances of strings&gt; found in `separators`.&gt;&gt; `s` should be `str` or `bytes`.&gt;&gt; `separators` should be an iterable of either `str` or `bytes`&gt; objects matching the type of `s`.&gt;&gt; If `left` is a true value, strips all leading separators&gt; from `s`.&gt;&gt; If `right` is a true value, strips all trailing separators&gt; from `s`.&gt;&gt; Processing always stops at the first character that&gt; doesn't match one of the separators.&gt;&gt; Returns a copy of `s` with the leading and/or trailing&gt; separators stripped.  (If `left` and `right` are both&gt; false, returns `s` unchanged.)&gt;&gt; For more information, see the deep-dive on&gt; [**The `multi-` family of functions.**](#The-multi--family-of-functions)#### `newlines`&gt; A list of all newline characters recognized by Python.&gt; Includes many Unicode newline characters, like `'\u2029'`&gt; (a paragraph separator).  Useful as a list of separator&gt; strings for&gt; [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)&gt; et al; `newlines` is specifically used by the&gt; [`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs)&gt; iterator constructor.&gt;&gt; **big** also defines `utf8_newlines`, which is `newlines`&gt; with all strings encoded to UTF-8 (as bytes),&gt; and `ascii_newlines`, with all strings converted into&gt; bytes and all characters with code points greater than&gt; 128 discarded.&gt;&gt; Note that `newlines` contains `'\r\n'`, the DOS sequence&gt; of characters representing a newline.  This lets **big**&gt; text-processing functions recognize this sequence as a&gt; *single* newline marker, rather than as two *separate*&gt; newline characters.  If you don't want this behavior,&gt; you can use `newlines_without_dos` instead.&gt; (**big** also provides `utf8_newlines_without_dos` and&gt; `ascii_newlines_without_dos`.)#### `normalize_whitespace(s, separators=None, replacement=None)`&gt; Returns `s`, but with every run of consecutive&gt; separator characters turned into a replacement string.&gt; By default turns all runs of consecutive whitespace&gt; characters into a single space character.&gt;&gt; `s` may be `str` or `bytes`.&gt; `separators` should be an iterable of either `str` or `bytes`&gt; objects, matching `s`.&gt; `replacement` should be either a `str` or `bytes` object,&gt; also matching `s`, or `None` (the default).&gt; If `replacement` is `None`, `normalize_whitespace` will use&gt; a replacement string consisting of a single space character.&gt;&gt; Leading or trailing runs of separator characters will&gt; be replaced with the replacement string, e.g.:&gt;&gt;     normalize_whitespace(&quot;   a    b   c&quot;) == &quot; a b c&quot;#### `parse_delimiters(s, delimiters=None)`&gt; Parses a string containing nesting delimiters.&gt; Raises an exception if mismatched delimiters are detected.&gt;&gt; `s` may be `str` or `bytes`.&gt;&gt; `delimiters` may be either `None` or an iterable containing&gt; either&gt; [`Delimiter`](#delimiteropen-close--backslashfalse-nestedtrue)&gt; objects or objects matching `s` (`str` or `bytes`).&gt; Entries in the `delimiters` iterable which are `str` or `bytes`&gt; should be exactly two characters long; these will be used&gt; as the `open` and `close` arguments for a new `Delimiter` object.&gt;&gt; If `delimiters` is `None`, `parse_delimiters` uses a default&gt; value matching these pairs of delimiters:&gt;&gt;     () [] {} &quot;&quot; ''&gt;&gt; The quote mark delimiters enable backslash quoting and disable nesting.&gt;&gt; Yields 3-tuples containing strings:&gt;&gt;     (text, open, close)&gt;&gt; where `text` is the text before the next opening or closing delimiter,&gt; `open` is the trailing opening delimiter,&gt; and `close` is the trailing closing delimiter.&gt; At least one of these three strings will always be non-empty.&gt; If `open` is non-empty, `close` will be empty, and vice-versa.&gt; If `s` does not end with a closing delimiter, in the final tuple&gt; yielded, both `open` and `close` will be empty strings.&gt;&gt; You can only specify a particular character as an opening delimiter&gt; once, though you may reuse a particular character as a closing&gt; delimiter multiple times.#### `re_partition(text, pattern, count=1, *, flags=0, reverse=False)`&gt; Like `str.partition`, but `pattern` is matched as a regular expression.&gt;&gt; `text` can be a string or a bytes object.&gt;&gt; `pattern` can be a string, bytes, or `re.Pattern` object.&gt;&gt; `text` and `pattern` (or `pattern.pattern`) must be the same type.&gt;&gt; If `pattern` is found in text, returns a tuple&gt; ```Python&gt;     (before, match, after)&gt; ```&gt; where `before` is the text before the matched text,&gt; `match` is the `re.Match` object resulting from the match, and&gt; `after` is the text after the matched text.&gt;&gt; If `pattern` appears in `text` multiple times,&gt; `re_partition` will match against the first (leftmost)&gt; appearance.&gt;&gt; If `pattern` is not found in `text`, returns a tuple&gt; ```Python&gt;     (text, None, '')&gt; ```&gt; where the empty string is `str` or `bytes` as appropriate.&gt;&gt; Passing in an explicit `count` lets you control how many times&gt; `re_partition` partitions the string.  `re_partition` will always&gt; return a tuple containing `(2*count)+1` elements, and&gt; odd-numbered elements will be either `re.Match` objects or `None`.&gt; Passing in a `count` of 0 will always return a tuple containing `s`.&gt;&gt; If `pattern` is a string or bytes object, `flags` is passed in&gt; as the `flags` argument to `re.compile`.&gt;&gt; If `reverse` is true, partitions starting at the right,&gt; like [`re_rpartition`](#re_rpartitiontext-pattern-count1--flags0).&gt;&gt; (In older versions of Python, `re.Pattern` was a private type called&gt; `re._pattern_type`.)#### `re_rpartition(text, pattern, count=1, *, flags=0)`&gt; Like `str.rpartition`, but `pattern` is matched as a regular expression.&gt;&gt; `text` can be a `str` or `bytes` object.&gt;&gt; `pattern` can be a `str`, `bytes`, or `re.Pattern` object.&gt;&gt; `text` and `pattern` (or `pattern.pattern`) must be the same type.&gt;&gt; If `pattern` is found in `text`, returns a tuple&gt; ```Python&gt;     (before, match, after)&gt; ```&gt; where `before` is the text before the matched text,&gt; `match` is the re.Match object resulting from the match, and&gt; `after` is the text after the matched text.&gt;&gt; If `pattern` appears in `text` multiple times,&gt; `re_partition` will match against the last (rightmost)&gt; appearance.&gt;&gt; If `pattern` is not found in `text`, returns a tuple&gt; ```Python&gt;     ('', None, text)&gt; ```&gt; where the empty string is `str` or `bytes` as appropriate.&gt;&gt; Passing in an explicit `count` lets you control how many times&gt; `re_rpartition` partitions the string.  `re_rpartition` will always&gt; return a tuple containing `(2*count)+1` elements, and&gt; odd-numbered elements will be either `re.Match` objects or `None`.&gt; Passing in a `count` of 0 will always return a tuple containing `s`.&gt;&gt; If `pattern` is a string, `flags` is passed in&gt; as the `flags` argument to `re.compile`.&gt;&gt; (In older versions of Python, `re.Pattern` was a private type called&gt; `re._pattern_type`.)#### `reversed_re_finditer(pattern, string, flags=0)`&gt; An iterator.  Behaves almost identically to the Python&gt; standard library function `re.finditer`, yielding&gt; non-overlapping matches of `pattern` in `string`.  The difference&gt; is, `reversed_re_finditer` searches `string` from right to left.&gt;&gt; `pattern` can be str, bytes, or a precompiled `re.Pattern` object.&gt; If it's str or bytes, it'll be compiled&gt; with `re.compile` using the `flags` you passed in.&gt;&gt; `string` should be the same type as `pattern` (or `pattern.pattern`).#### `split_quoted_strings(s, quotes=('&quot;', &quot;'&quot;), *, triple_quotes=True, backslash='\\')`&gt; Splits `s` into quoted and unquoted segments.&gt;&gt; `s` can be either `str` or `bytes`.&gt;&gt; `quotes` is an iterable of quote separators, either `str` or `bytes`&gt; matching `s`.  Note that `split_quoted_strings`&gt; only supports quote *characters,* as in, each quote separator must be exactly&gt; one character long.&gt;&gt; Returns an iterator yielding 2-tuples:&gt;     (is_quoted, segment)&gt; where `segment` is a substring of `s`, and `is_quoted` is true if the segment is&gt; quoted.  Joining all the segments together recreates `s`.&gt;&gt; If `triple_quotes` is true, supports &quot;triple-quoted&quot; strings like Python.&gt;&gt; If `backslash` is a character, this character will quoting characters inside&gt; a quoted string, like the backslash character inside strings in Python.#### `split_text_with_code(s, *, tab_width=8, allow_code=True, code_indent=4, convert_tabs_to_spaces=True)`&gt; Splits `s` into individual words,&gt; suitable for feeding into&gt; [`wrap_words`](#wrap_wordswords-margin79--two_spacestrue).&gt;&gt; `s` may be either `str` or `bytes`.&gt;&gt; Paragraphs indented by less than `code_indent` will be&gt; broken up into individual words.&gt;&gt; If `allow_code` is true, paragraphs indented by at least&gt; `code_indent` spaces will preserve their whitespace:&gt; internal whitespace is preserved, and the newline is&gt; preserved.  (This will preserve the formatting of code&gt; examples when these words are rejoined into lines by&gt; [`wrap_words`](#wrap_wordswords-margin79--two_spacestrue).)&gt;&gt; For more information, see the deep-dive on&gt; [**Word wrapping and formatting.**](#word-wrapping-and-formatting)#### `whitespace`&gt; A list of all whitespace characters recognized by Python.&gt; Includes many Unicode whitespace strings, like `'\xa0'`&gt; (a non-breaking space).  Useful as a list of separator&gt; strings for&gt; [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)&gt;5 et al.&gt;&gt; **big** also defines `utf8_whitespace`, which is `whitespace`&gt; with all strings encoded to UTF-8 (as bytes),&gt; and `ascii_whitespace`, with all strings converted into&gt; bytes and all characters with code points greater than&gt; 128 discarded.&gt;&gt; Note that `whitespace` contains `'\r\n'`, the DOS sequence&gt; of characters representing a newline.  This lets **big**&gt; text-processing functions recognize this sequence as a&gt; *single* whitespace marker, rather than as two *separate*&gt; whitespace characters.  If you don't want this behavior,&gt; you can use `whitespace_without_dos` instead;&gt; **big** also provides `utf8_whitespace_without_dos` and&gt; `ascii_whitespace_without_dos`.#### `wrap_words(words, margin=79, *, two_spaces=True)`&gt; Combines `words` into lines and returns the result as a string.&gt; Similar to `textwrap.wrap`.&gt;&gt; `words` should be an iterator yielding str or bytes strings,&gt; and these strings should already be split at word boundaries.&gt; Here's an example of a valid argument for `words`:&gt; ```Python&gt;      &quot;this is an example of text split at word boundaries&quot;.split()&gt; ```&gt;&gt; A single `'\n'` indicates a line break.&gt; If you want a paragraph break, embed two `'\n'` characters in a row.&gt;&gt; `margin` specifies the maximum length of each line. The length of&gt; every line will be less than or equal to `margin`, unless the length&gt; of an individual element inside `words` is greater than `margin`.&gt;&gt; If `two_spaces` is true, elements from `words` that end in&gt; sentence-ending punctuation (`'.'`, `'?'`, and `'!'`)&gt; will be followed by two spaces, not one.&gt;&gt; Elements in `words` are not modified; any leading or trailing&gt; whitespace will be preserved.  You can use this to preserve&gt; whitespace where necessary, like in code examples.&gt;&gt; For more information, see the deep-dive on&gt; [**Word wrapping and formatting.**](#word-wrapping-and-formatting)## `big.time`Functions for working with time.  Currently deals specificallywith timestamps.  The time functions in **big** are designedto make it easy to use best practices.#### `date_ensure_timezone(d, timezone)`&gt; Ensures that a `datetime.date` object has&gt; a timezone set.&gt;&gt; If `d` has a timezone set, returns `d`.&gt; Otherwise, returns a new `datetime.date`&gt; object equivalent to `d` with its `tzinfo` set&gt; to `timezone`.#### `date_set_timezone(d, timezone)`&gt; Returns a new `datetime.date` object identical&gt; to `d` but with its `tzinfo` set to `timezone`.#### `datetime_ensure_timezone(d, timezone)`&gt; Ensures that a `datetime.datetime` object has&gt; a timezone set.&gt;&gt; If `d` has a timezone set, returns `d`.&gt; Otherwise, creates a new `datetime.datetime`&gt; object equivalent to `d` with its `tzinfo` set&gt; to `timezone`.#### `datetime_set_timezone(d, timezone)`&gt; Returns a new `datetime.datetime` object identical&gt; to `d` but with its `tzinfo` set to `timezone`.#### `parse_timestamp_3339Z(s, *, timezone=None)`&gt; Parses a timestamp string returned by `timestamp_3339Z`.&gt; Returns a `datetime.datetime` object.&gt;&gt; `timezone` is an optional default timezone, and should&gt; be a `datetime.tzinfo` object (or `None`).  If provided,&gt; and the time represented in the string doesn't specify&gt; a timezone, the `tzinfo` attribute of the returned object&gt; will be explicitly set to `timezone`.&gt;&gt; `parse_timestamp_3339Z` depends on the&gt; [`python-dateutil`](https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil)&gt; package.  If `python-dateutil` is unavailable,&gt; `parse_timestamp_3339Z` will also be unavailable.#### `timestamp_3339Z(t=None, want_microseconds=None)`&gt; Return a timestamp string in RFC 3339 format, in the UTC&gt; time zone.  This format is intended for computer-parsable&gt; timestamps; for human-readable timestamps, use `timestamp_human()`.&gt;&gt; Example timestamp: `'2021-05-25T06:46:35.425327Z'`&gt;&gt; `t` may be one of several types:&gt;&gt; - If `t` is None, `timestamp_3339Z` uses the current time in UTC.&gt; - If `t` is an int or a float, it's interpreted as seconds&gt; since the epoch in the UTC time zone.&gt; - If `t` is a `time.struct_time` object or `datetime.datetime`&gt; object, and it's not in UTC, it's converted to UTC.&gt; (Technically, `time.struct_time` objects are converted to GMT,&gt; using `time.gmtime`.  Sorry, pedants!)&gt;&gt; If `want_microseconds` is true, the timestamp ends with&gt; microseconds, represented as a period and six digits between&gt; the seconds and the `'Z'`.

These functionsare well-designed, and often do what you want.  But they'resurprisingly opinionated.  And... what if your use case doesn'tfit exactly into their narrow functionality?  `str.strip`supports two specific modes of operation; if you wantto split your string in a slightly different way, youprobably can't use `str.strip`.So what *can* you use?  There's `re.strip`, but it can behard to use.  Now there's a new answer:[`multisplit`.](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)[`multisplit`'s](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)goal is to be the be-all end-all string splitting function.It's designed to replace every mode of operation for`str.split`, `str.rstrip`, and `str.splitlines`, and itcan even replace `str.partition` and `str.rpartition`.(**big** uses[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)to implement[`multipartition`.)](#multipartitions-separators-count1--reverseFalse-separateTrue)To use[`multisplit`,](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)pass in the string you want to split, the separators youwant to split on, and tweak its behavior with its fivekeyword arguments.  It returns an iterator that yieldsstring segments from the original string in your preferredformat.The cornerstone of [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)is the `separators` argument.This is an iterable of strings, of the same type (`str` or `bytes`)as the string you want to split (`s`).  `multisplit` will splitthe string at *each* non-overlapping instance of any stringspecified in `separators`.  Internally, `multisplit` isimplemented using `re.split` for speed.[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)also let you fine-tune how it splits, through five keyword-onlyparameters:* `keep` lets you include the separator strings in the output,  in a number of different formats.* `separate` lets you specify whether adjacent separator strings  should be grouped together (like `str.strip` operating on  whitespace) or regarded as separate (like `str.strip` when  you pass in an explicit `sep` separator).* `strip` lets you strip separator strings from the beginning,  end, or both ends of the string you're splitting.  It also  supports a special *progressive* mode that duplicates the  behavior of `str.strip` when you use `None` as the separator.* `maxsplit` lets you specify the maximum number of times to  split the string, exactly like the `maxsplit` argument to `str.strip`.* `reverse` lets you apply `maxsplit` to the end of the string  and splitting backwards, exactly like `str.rstrip`.To make it slightly easier to remember, all these keyword-onlyparameters default to a false value.  (Well, technically,`maxsplit` defaults to the special value `-1`, for compatibilitywith `str.split`.  But this is its special &quot;don't do anything&quot;magic value.  All the *other* keyword-only parameters defaultto `False`.)[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)also inspired [`multistrip`](#multistrips-separators-leftTrue-rightTrue) and [`multipartition`,](#multipartitions-separators-count1--reverseFalse-separateTrue)which also take this same `separators` arguments.  There are alsoother **big** functions that take a `separators` argument; forconsistency's sakes, the parameter name always has the word`separators` in it.(For example, `comment_separators` for `lines_filter_comment_lines`.)The downside of [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)is that, since it *is* sosophisticated and tunable, it can be hard to use.  It takes*five keyword-only parameters* after all.  However, they'redesigned to be reasonably memorable, and their default valuesare designed to be easy to remember.  But the bestway to combat the complexity of calling[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)is to use it as a building block for your owntext splitting functions.  For example, inside **big**,[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)is used to implement[`multipartition`,](#multipartitions-separators-count1--reverseFalse-separateTrue)[`normalize_whitespace`,](#normalize_whitespaces-separatorsNone-replacementnone)[`lines`,](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs)and several others.### Demonstrations of each `multisplit` keyword-only parameterTo give you a sense of how the five keyword-only parameters changes the behavior of[`multisplit`,](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)here's a breakdown of each of these parameters with examples.#### `maxsplit``maxsplit` specifies the maximum number of times the string should be split.It behaves the same as the `maxsplit` parameter to `str.split`.The default value of `-1` means &quot;split as many times as you can&quot;.  In ourexample here, the string can be split a maximum of three times.  Therefore,specifying a `maxsplit` of `-1` is equivalent to specifying a `maxsplit` of`2` or greater:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookie', ('X', 'Y'))) # &quot;maxsplit&quot; defaults to -1    ['apple', 'banana', 'cookie']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), maxsplit=0))    ['appleXbananaYcookie']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), maxsplit=1))    ['apple', 'bananaYcookie']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), maxsplit=2))    ['apple', 'banana', 'cookie']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), maxsplit=3))    ['apple', 'banana', 'cookie']````maxsplit` has interactions with `reverse` and `strip`.  For moreinformation, see the documentation regarding those parameters, below.#### `keep``keep` indicates whether or not `multisplit` should preserve the separatorstrings in the strings it yields.  It supports four values: false, true,and the special values `ALTERNATING` and `AS_PAIRS`.```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookie', ('X', 'Y'))) # &quot;keep&quot; defaults to False    ['apple', 'banana', 'cookie']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), keep=False))    ['apple', 'banana', 'cookie']```When `keep` is true, `multisplit` keeps the separators, appending them tothe end of the separated string:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), keep=True))    ['appleX', 'bananaY', 'cookie']```When `keep` is `ALTERNATING`, `multisplit` keeps the separators as separatestrings.  The first string yielded is always a non-separator string, andfrom then on it always alternates between a separator string and a non-separatorstring.  Put another way, if you store the output of `multisplit` in a list,entries with an even-numbered index (0, 2, 4, ...) are always non-separator strings,and entries with an odd-numbered index (1, 3, 5, ...) are always separator strings.```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), keep=big.ALTERNATING))    ['apple', 'X', 'banana', 'Y', 'cookie']```Note that `ALTERNATING` always emits an odd number of strings; the first and laststrings are always non-separator strings.  Like `str.split`, if the string you'resplitting starts or ends with a separator string, `multisplit` will emit an emptystring there:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('1a1z1', ('1',), keep=big.ALTERNATING))    ['', '1', 'a', '1', 'z', '1', '']```Finally, when `keep` is `AS_PAIRS`,  `multisplit` keeps the separators as separatestrings.  But instead of yielding strings, it yields 2-tuples of strings.  Every2-tuple contains a non-separator string followed by a separator string.If the original string starts with a separator, the first 2-tuple will containan empty non-separator string and the separator:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('YappleXbananaYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), keep=big.AS_PAIRS))    [('', 'Y'), ('apple', 'X'), ('banana', 'Y'), ('cookie', '')]```The last 2-tuple will *always* contain an empty separator string:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), keep=big.AS_PAIRS))    [('apple', 'X'), ('banana', 'Y'), ('cookie', '')]    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookieXXX', ('X', 'Y'), keep=big.AS_PAIRS, strip=True))    [('apple', 'X'), ('banana', 'Y'), ('cookie', '')]```(This rule means that `AS_PAIRS` always emits an *even* number of strings.Contrast that with `ALTERNATING`, which always emits an *odd* number of strings,and the last string it emits is always a non-separator string.  Put anotherway: if you ignore the tuples, the list of strings emitted by `AS_PAIRS` is thesame as those emitted by `ALTERNATING`, except `AS_PAIRS` appends an emptystring.)Because of this rule, if the original string ends with a separator,and `multisplit` doesn't `strip` the right side, the final tupleemitted by `AS_PAIRS` will be a 2-tuple containing two empty strings:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookieX', ('X', 'Y'), keep=big.AS_PAIRS))    [('apple', 'X'), ('banana', 'Y'), ('cookie', 'X'), ('', '')]```This looks strange and unnecessary.  But it *is* what you want.This odd-looking behavior is discussed at length in the section below, titled[Why do you sometimes get empty strings when you split?](#why-do-you-sometimes-get-empty-strings-when-you-split)The behavior of `keep` can be affected by the value of `separate`.For more information, see the next section, on `separate`.#### `separate``separate` indicates whether multisplit should consider adjacentseparator strings in `s` as one separator or as multiple separatorseach separated by a zero-length string.  It can be either false ortrue.```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXYbananaYXYcookie', ('X', 'Y'))) # separate defaults to False    ['apple', 'banana', 'cookie']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXYbananaYXYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), separate=False))    ['apple', 'banana', 'cookie']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXYbananaYXYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), separate=True))    ['apple', '', 'banana', '', '', 'cookie']```If `separate` and `keep` are both true values, and your stringhas multiple adjacent separators, `multisplit` will view `s`as having zero-length non-separator strings between theadjacent separators:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXYbananaYXYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), separate=True, keep=True))    ['appleX', 'Y', 'bananaY', 'X', 'Y', 'cookie']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXYbananaYXYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), separate=True, keep=big.AS_PAIRS))    [('apple', 'X'), ('', 'Y'), ('banana', 'Y'), ('', 'X'), ('', 'Y'), ('cookie', '')]```#### `strip``strip` indicates whether multisplit should strip separators fromthe beginning and/or end of `s`.  It supports six values:false, true, `big.LEFT`, `big.RIGHT`, and `big.PROGRESSIVE`.By default, `strip` is false, which means it doesn't strip anyleading or trailing separators:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('XYappleXbananaYcookieYXY', ('X', 'Y'))) # strip defaults to False    ['', 'apple', 'banana', 'cookie', '']```Setting `strip` to true strips both leading and trailing separators:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('XYappleXbananaYcookieYXY', ('X', 'Y'), strip=True))    ['apple', 'banana', 'cookie']````big.LEFT` and `big.RIGHT` tell `multistrip` to only strip on thatside of the string:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('XYappleXbananaYcookieYXY', ('X', 'Y'), strip=big.LEFT))    ['apple', 'banana', 'cookie', '']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('XYappleXbananaYcookieYXY', ('X', 'Y'), strip=big.RIGHT))    ['', 'apple', 'banana', 'cookie']````big.PROGRESSIVE` duplicates a specific behavior of `str.split` when using`maxsplit`.  It always strips on the left, but it only strips on the rightif the string is completely split.  If `maxsplit` is reached before the entirestring is split, and `strip` is `big.PROGRESSIVE`, `multisplit` *won't* stripthe right side of the string.  Note in this example how the trailing separator`Y` isn't stripped from the input string when `maxsplit` is less than `3`.```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('XappleXbananaYcookieY', ('X', 'Y'), strip=big.PROGRESSIVE))    ['apple', 'banana', 'cookie']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('XappleXbananaYcookieY', ('X', 'Y'), maxsplit=0, strip=big.PROGRESSIVE))    ['appleXbananaYcookieY']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('XappleXbananaYcookieY', ('X', 'Y'), maxsplit=1, strip=big.PROGRESSIVE))    ['apple', 'bananaYcookieY']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('XappleXbananaYcookieY', ('X', 'Y'), maxsplit=2, strip=big.PROGRESSIVE))    ['apple', 'banana', 'cookieY']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('XappleXbananaYcookieY', ('X', 'Y'), maxsplit=3, strip=big.PROGRESSIVE))    ['apple', 'banana', 'cookie']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('XappleXbananaYcookieY', ('X', 'Y'), maxsplit=4, strip=big.PROGRESSIVE))    ['apple', 'banana', 'cookie']```#### `reverse``reverse` specifies where `multisplit` starts parsing the string--fromthe beginning, or the end--and in what direction it moves when parsingthe string--towards the end, or towards the beginning.  It only supportstwo values: when it's false, `multisplit` starts at the beginning of thestring, and parses moving to the right (towards the end of the string).But when `reverse` is true, `multisplit` starts at the *end* of thestring, and parses moving to the *left* (towards the *beginning*of the string).This has two noticable effects on `multisplit`'s output.  First, thischanges which splits are kept when `maxsplit` is less than the total numberof splits in the string.  When `reverse` is true, the splits are countedstarting on the right and moving towards the left:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), reverse=True)) # maxsplit defaults to -1    ['apple', 'banana', 'cookie']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), maxsplit=0, reverse=True))    ['appleXbananaYcookie']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), maxsplit=1, reverse=True))    ['appleXbanana', 'cookie']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), maxsplit=2, reverse=True))    ['apple', 'banana', 'cookie']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXbananaYcookie', ('X', 'Y'), maxsplit=3, reverse=True))    ['apple', 'banana', 'cookie']```The second effect is far more subtle.  It's only relevant when splitting stringscontaining multiple *overlapping* separators.  When `reverse` is false, and thereare two (or more) overlapping separators, the string is split by the *leftmost*overlapping separator.  When `reverse` is true, and there are two (or more)overlapping separators, the string is split by the *rightmost* overlappingseparator.Consider these two calls to `multisplit`.  The only difference between them isthe value of `reverse`.  They produce different results, even though neitherone uses `maxsplit`.```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXAYbananaXAYcookie', ('XA', 'AY'))) # reverse defaults to False    ['apple', 'Ybanana', 'Ycookie']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('appleXAYbananaXAYcookie', ('XA', 'AY'), reverse=True))    ['appleX', 'bananaX', 'cookie']```### Reimplementing library functions using `multisplit`Here are some examples of how you could use[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)to replace some common Python string splitting methods.  These exactly duplicate thebehavior of the originals.```Pythondef _multisplit_to_split(s, sep, maxsplit, reverse):    separate = sep != None    if separate:        strip = False    else:        sep = big.ascii_whitespace if isinstance(s, bytes) else big.whitespace        strip = big.PROGRESSIVE    result = list(big.multisplit(s, sep,        maxsplit=maxsplit, reverse=reverse,        separate=separate, strip=strip))    if not separate:        # ''.split() == '   '.split() == []        if result and (not result[-1]):            result.pop()    return resultdef str_split(s, sep=None, maxsplit=-1):    return _multisplit_to_split(s, sep, maxsplit, False)def str_rsplit(s, sep=None, maxsplit=-1):    return _multisplit_to_split(s, sep, maxsplit, True)def str_splitlines(s, keepends=False):    newlines = big.ascii_newlines if isinstance(s, bytes) else big.newlines    l = list(big.multisplit(s, newlines,        keep=keepends, separate=True, strip=False))    if l and not l[-1]:    # yes, ''.splitlines() returns an empty list        l.pop()    return ldef _partition_to_multisplit(s, sep, reverse):    if not sep:        raise ValueError(&quot;empty separator&quot;)    l = tuple(big.multisplit(s, (sep,),        keep=big.ALTERNATING, maxsplit=1, reverse=reverse, separate=True))    if len(l) == 1:        empty = b'' if isinstance(s, bytes) else ''        if reverse:            l = (empty, empty) + l        else:            l = l + (empty, empty)    return ldef str_partition(s, sep):    return _partition_to_multisplit(s, sep, False)def str_rpartition(s, sep):    return _partition_to_multisplit(s, sep, True)```You wouldn't want to use these, of course--Python's built-infunctions are so much faster!### Why do you sometimes get empty strings when you split?Sometimes when you split using[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse),you'll get empty strings in the return value.  This might be unexpected,violating the [Principle Of Least Astonishment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)But there are excellent reasons for this behavior.Let's start by observing what `str.split` does. `str.split` really has twomajor modes of operation: when you don't pass in a separator (or pass in `None` for theseparator), and when you pass in an explicit separator string.  In this latter mode,the documentation says it regards every instance of a separator string as an individualseparator splitting the string.  What does that mean?  Watch what happens when you havetwo adjacent separators in the string you're splitting:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; '1,2,,3'.split(',')    ['1', '2', '', '3']```What's that empty string doing between `'2'` and `'3'`?  Here's how you should think about it:when you pass in an explicit separator, `str.split` splits at *every* occurance of thatseparator in the string.  It *always* splits the string into two places, whenever there'sa separator.  And when there are two adjacent separators, conceptually, they have azero-length string in between them:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; '1,2,,3'[4:4]    ''```The empty string in the output of `str.split` represents the fact that therewere two adjacent separators.  If `str.split` didn't add that empty string,the output would look like this:```Python    ['1', '2', '3']```But then it'd be indistinguishable from splitting the same string *without*two separators in a row:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; '1,2,3'.split(',')    ['1', '2', '3']```This difference is crucial when you want to reconstruct the original string fromthe split list.  `str.split` with a separator should always be reversable using`str.join`, and with that empty string there it works correctly:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; ','.join(['1', '2', '3'])    '1,2,3'    &gt;&gt;&gt; ','.join(['1', '2', '', '3'])    '1,2,,3'```Now take a look at what happens when the stringyou're splitting starts or ends with a separator:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; ',1,2,3,'.split(',')    ['', '1', '2', '3', '']```This might seem weird.  But, just like with two adjacent separators,this behavior is important for consistency.  Conceptually there'sa zero-length string between the beginning of the string and the firstcomma.  And `str.join` needs those empty strings in order to correctlyrecreate the original string.```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; ','.join(['', '1', '2', '3', ''])    ',1,2,3,'```Naturally,[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)lets you duplicate this behavior.  When you want[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)to behave just like `str.split` does with an explicit separatorstring, just pass in `keep=False`, `separate=True`, and `strip=False`.That is, if `a` and `b` are strings,```Python     big.multisplit(a, (b,), keep=False, separate=True, strip=False)```always produces the same output as```Python     a.split(b)```For example, here's[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)splitting the strings we've been playing with, using these parameters:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('1,2,,3', (',',), keep=False, separate=True, strip=False))    ['1', '2', '', '3']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit(',1,2,3,', (',',), keep=False, separate=True, strip=False))    ['', '1', '2', '3', '']```This &quot;emit an empty string&quot; behavior also has ramifications when `keep` isn't false.The behavior of `keep=True` is easy to predict; `multisplit` just appends the separatorsto the previous string segment:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('1,2,,3', (',',), keep=True, separate=True, strip=False))    ['1,', '2,', ',', '3']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit(',1,2,3,', (',',), keep=True, separate=True, strip=False))    [',', '1,', '2,', '3,', '']```The principle here is that, when you use `keep=True`, you should be able to reconstitutethe original string with `''.join`:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; ''.join(['1,', '2,', ',', '3'])    '1,2,,3'    &gt;&gt;&gt; ''.join([',', '1,', '2,', '3,', ''])    ',1,2,3,'````keep=big.ALTERNATING` is much the same, except we insert the separators as theirown segments, rather than appending each one to the previous segment:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('1,2,,3', (',',), keep=big.ALTERNATING, separate=True, strip=False))    ['1', ',', '2', ',', '', ',', '3']    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit(',1,2,3,', (',',), keep=big.ALTERNATING, separate=True, strip=False))    ['', ',', '1', ',', '2', ',', '3', ',', '']```Remember, `ALTERNATING` output always begins and ends with a non-separator string.If the string you're splitting begins or ends with a separator, the outputfrom `multisplit` specifying `keep=ALTERNATING` will correspondingly begin or endwith an empty string.And, as with `keep=True`, you can also recreate the original string by passingthese arrays in to `''.join`:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; ''.join(['1', ',', '2', ',', '', ',', '3'])    '1,2,,3'    &gt;&gt;&gt; ''.join(['', ',', '1', ',', '2', ',', '3', ',', ''])    ',1,2,3,'```Finally there's `keep=big.AS_PAIRS`.  The behavior here seemed so strange,initially I thought it was wrong.  But I've given it a *lot* of thought, andI've convinced myself that this is correct:```Python    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('1,2,,3', (',',), keep=big.AS_PAIRS, separate=True, strip=False))    [('1', ','), ('2', ','), ('', ','), ('3', '')]    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit(',1,2,3,', (',',), keep=big.AS_PAIRS, separate=True, strip=False))    [('', ','), ('1', ','), ('2', ','), ('3', ','), ('', '')]```That tuple at the end, just containing two empty strings:```Python    ('', '')```It's *so strange.*  How can that be right?It's the same as `str.split`.[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)*must* split the string into two pieces *every* time it finds the separatorin the original string.  So it *must* emit the empty non-separator string.And since that zero-length string isn't (cannot!) be followed by a separator,when using `keep=AS_PAIRS` the final separator string is *also* empty.Think of it this way: with the tuple of empty strings there, you can easilyconvert one `keep` format into any another.  (Provided that you knowwhat the separators were--either the source `keep` format was not false,or you only used one separator string when calling `multisplit`).Without that tuple of empty strings at the end, you'd also have to have an`if` statement to add or remove empty stuff from the end.I'll demonstrate this with a simple example.  Here's the output of`multisplit` splitting the string `'1a1z1'` by the separator `'1'`,in each of the four `keep` formats:```Python&gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('1a1z1', '1', keep=False))['', 'a', 'z', '']&gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('1a1z1', '1', keep=True))['1', 'a1', 'z1', '']&gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('1a1z1', '1', keep=big.ALTERNATING))['', '1', 'a', '1', 'z', '1', '']&gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('1a1z1', '1', keep=big.AS_PAIRS))[('', '1'), ('a', '1'), ('z', '1'), ('', '')]```Because the `AS_PAIRS` output ends with that tuple of emptystrings, we can mechanically convert it into any of the otherformats, like so:```Python&gt;&gt;&gt; result = list(big.multisplit('1a1z1', '1', keep=big.AS_PAIRS))&gt;&gt;&gt; result[('', '1'), ('a', '1'), ('z', '1'), ('', '')]&gt;&gt;&gt; [s[0] for s in result] # convert to keep=False['', 'a', 'z', '']&gt;&gt;&gt; [s[0]+s[1] for s in result] # convert to keep=True['1', 'a1', 'z1', '']&gt;&gt;&gt; [s for t in result for s in t][:-1] # convert to keep=big.ALTERNATING['', '1', 'a', '1', 'z', '1', '']```If the `AS_PAIRS` output *didn't* end with that tuple of empty strings,you'd need to add an `if` statement to restore the trailing emptystrings as needed.### Other differences between multisplit and str.split`str.split` returns an *empty list* when you split anempty string by whitespace:```Python&gt;&gt;&gt; ''.split()[]```But not when you split by an explicit separator:```Python&gt;&gt;&gt; ''.split('x')['']```[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)is consistent here.  If you split an empty string, it always returns an empty string,as long as the separators are valid:```Python&gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit(''))['']&gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('', ('a', 'b', 'c')))['']```Similarly, when splitting a string that only contains whitespace, `str.split` alsoreturns an empty list:```Python&gt;&gt;&gt; '     '.split()[]```This is really the same as &quot;splitting an empty string&quot;, because when `str.split`splits on whitespace, the first thing it does is strip leading whitespace.If you [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)a string that only contains whitespace, and you split on whitespace characters,it returns two empty strings:```Python&gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('     '))['', '']```This is because the string conceptually starts with a zero-length string,then has a run of whitespace characters, then ends with another zero-lengthstring.  So those two empty strings are the leading and trailing zero-lengthstrings, separated by whitespace.  If you tell[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)to also strip the string, you'll get back a single empty string:```Python&gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('     ', strip=True))['']```And[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)behaves consistently even when you use different separators:```Python&gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('ababa', 'ab'))['', '']&gt;&gt;&gt; list(big.multisplit('ababa', 'ab', strip=True))['']```## `lines` and lines modifier functions[`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs) creates an iterator that yields individual linessplit from a string.  It's designed to make it easy to writewell-behaved simple text parsers.For example, every yielded line is accompanied by a `LinesInfo`object which provides the line number and starting column numberfor each line.  This makes it easy for your parser to provideline and column information for error messages.The output of [`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs) can be modified by &quot;lines modifier&quot;functions.  These are functions that iterate over a linesiterator and re-yield the values, possibly modifying ordiscarding them along the way.  For example, passinga [`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs) iterator into `lines_filter_empty_lines` resultsin an iterator that skips over the empty lines.All the lines modifier functions that ship with bigstart with the string `lines_`.Actually there are additional constraints on lines modifierfunction names.  The second word in the function name,immediately after `lines_`, may denote the lines modifier'scategory.  Some examples:* `lines_filter_` functions may remove  lines from the output.  For example, `lines_filter_empty_lines`  will only yield a line if it isn't empty.* `lines_strip_` functions may remove one or  more substrings from the line.  For example,  [`lines_strip_indent(li)`](#lines_strip_indentli)  strips the leading whitespace from a line before yielding  it.  (Whenever a lines modifier removes leading text from a line,  it will add a `leading` field to the accompanying `LineInfo` object  containing the removed substring, and will also update the  `column_number` of the line to reflect the new starting column.)* `lines_convert_` functions means this lines modifier may change one  or more substrings in the line.  For example,  `lines_convert_tabs_to_spaces` changes tab characters  to space characters in any lines it processes.(**big** isn't strict about these category names though.For example,[`lines_containing(li, s, *, invert=False)`](#lines_containingli-s--invertfalse)and[`lines_grep(li, pattern, *, invert=False, flags=0)`](#lines_grepli-pattern--invertfalse-flags0)are obviously &quot;filter&quot; modifiers, but their namesdon't start with `lines_filter_`.)All lines modifier functions are composable with eachother; you can &quot;stack&quot; them together simply by passingthe output of one into the input of another.  For example,```Python     with open(&quot;textfile.txt&quot;, &quot;rt&quot;) as f:         for info, line in big.lines_filter_empty_lines(          big.lines_rstrip(lines(f.read()))):          ...```will iterate over the lines of `textfile.txt`, skippingover all empty lines and lines that consist only ofwhitespace.When you stack line modifiers in this way, note that the*outer* modifiers happen *later*.  In the above example,each line is first &quot;r-stripped&quot;, and then discardedif it's empty.  If you stacked the line modifiers inthe opposite order:```Python     with open(&quot;textfile.txt&quot;, &quot;rt&quot;) as f:         for info, line in big.lines_rstrip(          big.lines_filter_empty_lines(lines(f.read()))):          ...```then it'd filter out empty lines first, and *then*&quot;r-strip&quot; the lines.  So lines in the input that containedonly whitespace would still get yielded as empty lines,which is probably not what you want.Of course, you can write your own lines modifier functions!Simply accept a lines iterator as an argument, iterate overit, and yield each line info and line, modifying them(or not yielding them!) as you see fit.  You can potentiallyeven write your own lines iterator, a replacement for[`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs),if you need functionality[`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs) doesn't provide.Note that if you write your own lines modifier function,and it removes text from the beginning the line, you'll have toupdate the `LineInfo` object manually--it doesn't happenautomatically.## Word wrapping and formatting**big** contains three functions used to reflow and format textin a pleasing manner.  In the order you should use them, they are[`split_text_with_code`](#split_text_with_codes--tab_width8-allow_codetrue-code_indent4-convert_tabs_to_spacestrue),[`wrap_words(),`](#wrap_wordswords-margin79--two_spacestrue),and optionally[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0).This trio of functions gives you the following word-wrap superpowers:* Paragraphs of text representing embedded &quot;code&quot; don't get word-wrapped.  Instead, their formatting is preserved.* Multiple texts can be merged together into multiple columns.### &quot;text&quot; vs &quot;code&quot;The **big** word wrapping functions also distinguish between&quot;text&quot; and &quot;code&quot;.  The main distinction is, &quot;text&quot; lines canget word-wrapped, but &quot;code&quot; lines shouldn't.  **big** considersany line starting with enough whitespace to be a &quot;code&quot; line;by default, this is four spaces.  Any non-blank line thatstarting with four spaces is a &quot;code&quot; line, and any non-blankline that starts with less than four spaces is a &quot;text&quot; line.In &quot;text&quot; mode:* words are separated by whitespace,* initial whitespace on the line is discarded,* the amount of whitespace between words is irrelevant,* individual newline characters are ignored, and* more than two newline characters are converted into exactly  two newlines (aka a &quot;paragraph break&quot;).In &quot;code&quot; mode:* all whitespace is preserved, except for trailing whitespace on a line, and* all newline characters are preserved.Also, whenever[`split_text_with_code`](#split_text_with_codes--tab_width8-allow_codetrue-code_indent4-convert_tabs_to_spacestrue)switches between&quot;text&quot; and &quot;code&quot; mode, it emits a paragraph break.#### Split text arrayA *split text array* is an intermediary data structureused by **big.text** functions to represent text.It's literally just an array of strings, where the stringsrepresent individual word-wrappable substrings.[`split_text_with_code`](#split_text_with_codes--tab_width8-allow_codetrue-code_indent4-convert_tabs_to_spacestrue)returns a *split text array,* and[`wrap_words()`](#wrap_wordswords-margin79--two_spacestrue)consumes a *split text array.*You'll see four kinds of strings in a *split text array:** Individual words, ready to be word-wrapped.* Entire lines of &quot;code&quot;, preserving their formatting.* Line breaks, represented by a single newline: `'\n'`.* Paragraph breaks, represented by two newlines: `'\n\n'`.#### ExamplesThis might be clearer with an example or two.  The following text:```hello there!this is text.this is a second paragraph!```would be represented in a Python string as:```Python&quot;hello there!\nthis is text.\n\n\nthis is a second paragraph!&quot;```Note the three newlines between the second and third lines.If you then passed this string in to[`split_text_with_code`,](#split_text_with_codes--tab_width8-allow_codetrue-code_indent4-convert_tabs_to_spacestrue)it'd return this *split text array:*```Python[ 'hello', 'there!', 'this', 'is', 'text.', '\n\n',  'this', 'is', 'a', 'second', 'paragraph!']```[`split_text_with_code`](#split_text_with_codes--tab_width8-allow_codetrue-code_indent4-convert_tabs_to_spacestrue)merged the first two lines together intoa single paragraph, and collapsed the three newlines separatingthe two paragraphs into a &quot;paragraph break&quot; marker(two newlines in one string).Now let's add an example of text with some &quot;code&quot;.  This text:```What are the first four squared numbers?    for i in range(1, 5):        print(i**2)Python is just that easy!```would be represented in a Python string as (broken up into multiple strings for clarity):```Python&quot;What are the first four squared numbers?\n\n&quot;+&quot;    for i in range(1, 5):\n\n\n&quot;+&quot;        print(i**2)\n\nPython is just that easy!&quot;```[`split_text_with_code`](#split_text_with_codes--tab_width8-allow_codetrue-code_indent4-convert_tabs_to_spacestrue)considers the two lines with initial whitespace as &quot;code&quot; lines,and so the text is split into the following *split text array:*```Python['What', 'are', 'the', 'first', 'four', 'squared', 'numbers?', '\n\n',  '    for i in range(1, 5):', '\n', '\n', '\n', '        print(i**2)', '\n\n',  'Python', 'is', 'just', 'that', 'easy!']```Here we have a &quot;text&quot; paragraph, followed by a &quot;code&quot; paragraph, followedby a second &quot;text&quot; paragraph.  The &quot;code&quot; paragraph preserves the internalnewlines, though they are represented as individual &quot;line break&quot; markers(strings containing a single newline).  Every paragraph is separated bya &quot;paragraph marker&quot;.Here's a simple algorithm for joining a *split text array* back into asingle string:```Pythonprev = Nonea = []for word in split_text_array:    if not (prev and prev.isspace() and word.isspace()):        a.append(' ')    a.append(word)text = &quot;&quot;.join(a)```Of course, this algorithm is too simple to do word wrapping.Nor does it handle adding two spaces after sentence-endingpunctuation.  In practice, you shouldn't do this by hand;you should use[`wrap_words`](#wrap_wordswords-margin79--two_spacestrue).#### Merging columns[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0)merges multiple strings into columns on the same line.For example, it could merge these three Python strings:```Python[&quot;Here's the first\ncolumn of text.&quot;,&quot;More text over here!\nIt's the second\ncolumn!  How\nexciting!&quot;,&quot;And here's a\nthird column.&quot;,]```into the following text:```Here's the first    More text over here!   And here's acolumn of text.     It's the second        third column.                    column!  How                    exciting!```(Note that[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0)doesn't do its own word-wrapping;instead, it's designed to consume the output of[`wrap_words`](#wrap_wordswords-margin79--two_spacestrue).)Each column is passed in to[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0)as a &quot;column tuple&quot;:```Python(s, min_width, max_width)````s` is the string,`min_width` is the minimum width of the column, and`max_width` is the minimum width of the column.As you saw above, `s` can contain newline characters,and[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0)obeys those when formatting each column.For each column,[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0)measures the longestline of each column.  The width of the column is determinedas follows:- If the longest line is less than `min_width` characters long,  the column will be `min_width` characters wide.- If the longest line is less than or equal to `min_width`  characters long, and less than or equal to `max_width`  characters long, the column will be as wide as the longest line.- If the longest line is greater than `max_width` characters long,  the column will be `max_width` characters wide, and lines that  are longer than `max_width` characters will &quot;overflow&quot;.#### OverflowWhat is &quot;overflow&quot;?  It's a condition[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0)may encounter when the text in a column is wider than thatcolumn's `max_width`.[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0)needs to consider both &quot;overflow lines&quot;,lines that are longer than `max_width`, and &quot;overflow columns&quot;,columns that contain one or more overflow lines.What does[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0)do when it encounters overflow?[`merge_columns`](#merge_columnscolumns-column_separator--overflow_responseoverflowresponseraise-overflow_before0-overflow_after0)supports three &quot;strategies&quot; to deal with this condition, and you can specifywhich one you want using its `overflow_strategy` parameter.  The threestrategies are:- `OverflowStrategy.RAISE`: Raise an `OverflowError` exception.  The default.- `OverflowStrategy.INTRUDE_ALL`: Intrude into all subsequent columns onall lines where the overflowed column is wider than its `max_width`.The subsequent columns &quot;make space&quot; for the overflow text by not addingtext on those overflowed lines; this is called &quot;pausing&quot; their output.- `OverflowStrategy.DELAY_ALL`:  Delay all columns after the overflowedcolumn, not beginning any until after the last overflowed linein the overflowed column.  This is like the `INTRUDE_ALL` strategy,except that the columns &quot;make space&quot; by pausing their output untilthe last overflowed line.When `overflow_strategy` is `INTRUDE_ALL` or `DELAY_ALL`, andeither `overflow_before` or `overflow_after` is nonzero, thesespecify the number of extra lines before or afterthe overflowed lines in a column where the subsequent columns&quot;pause&quot;.## Enhanced `TopologicalSorter`#### Overview**big**'s [`TopologicalSorter`](#topologicalsortergraphnone)is a drop-in replacement for[`graphlib.TopologicalSorter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/graphlib.html#graphlib.TopologicalSorter)in the Python standard library (new in 3.9).However, the version in **big** has been greatly upgraded:- `prepare` is now optional, though it still performs a cycle check.- You can add nodes and edges to a graph at any time, even while  iterating over the graph.  Adding nodes and edges always succeeds.- You can remove nodes from graph `g` with the new method `g.remove(node)`.  Again, you can do this at any time, even while iterating over the graph.  Removing a node from the graph always succeeds, assuming the node is in the graph.- The functionality for iterating over a graph now lives in its own object called  a *view*.  View objects implement the `get_ready`, `done`, and `__bool__`  methods.  There's a default view built in to the graph object;  the `get_ready`, `done`, and `__bool__` methods on a graph just call  into the graph's default view.  You can create a new view at any time  by calling the new `view` method.Note that if you're using a view to iterate over the graph, and you modify the graph,and the view now represents a state that isn't *coherent* with the graph,attempting to use that view raises a `RuntimeError`.  More on what I meanby &quot;coherence&quot; in a minute.This implementation also fixes some minor warts with the existing API:- In Python's implementation, `static_order` and `get_ready`/`done` are mutually exclusive.  If you ever call  `get_ready` on a graph,  you can never call `static_order`, and vice-versa.  The implementaiton in **big**  doesn't have this restriction, because its implementation of `static_order` creates and uses a new view object  every time it's called..- In Python's implementation, you can only iterate over the graph once, or call `static_order` once.  The implementation in **big** solves this in several ways: it allows you to create as many views as you  want, and you can call the new `reset` method on a view to reset it to its initial state.#### Graph / view coherenceSo what does it mean for a view to no longer be coherent with the graph?Consider the following code:```Pythong = big.TopologicalSorter()g.add('B', 'A')g.add('C', 'A')g.add('D', 'B', 'C')g.add('B', 'A')v = g.view()g.ready() # returns ('A',)g.add('A', 'Q')```First this code creates a graph `g` with a classic &quot;diamond&quot;dependency pattern.  Then it creates a new view `v`, and getsthe currently &quot;ready&quot; nodes, which consists just of the node`'A'`.  Finally it adds a new dependency: `'A'` depends on `'Q'`.At this moment, view `v` is no longer _coherent._  `'A'` has beenmarked as &quot;ready&quot;, but `'Q'` has not.  And yet `'A'` depends on `'Q'`.All those statements can't be true at the same time!So view `v` is no longer _coherent,_  and any attempt to interactwith `v` raises an exception.To state it more precisely: if view `v` is a view on graph `g`,and you call `g.add('Z', 'Y')`,and neither of these statements is true in view `v`:- `'Y'` has been marked as `done`.- `'Z'` has not yet been yielded by `get_ready`.then `v` is no longer &quot;coherent&quot;.(If `'Y'` has been marked as `done`, then it's okay to make `'Z'` dependent on`'Y'` regardless of what state `'Z'` is in.  Likewise, if `'Z'` hasn't been yieldedby `get_ready` yet, then it's okay to make `'Z'` dependent on `'Y'` regardlessof what state `'Y'` is in.)Note that you can restore a view to coherence.  In this case,removing either `Y` or `Z` from `g` would resolve the incoherencebetween `v` and `g`, and `v` would start working again.Also note that you can have multiple views, in various states of iteration,and by modifying the graph you may cause some to become incoherent but notothers.  Views are completely independent from each other.## Bound inner classes#### OverviewOne minor complaint I have about Python regards inner classes.An &quot;inner class&quot; is a class defined inside another class.  And,well, inner classes seem kind of half-baked.  Unlike functions,inner classes don't get bound to the object.Consider this Python code:```Pythonclass Outer(object):    def method(self):        pass    class Inner(object):        def __init__(self):            passo = Outer()o.method()i = o.Inner()```When `o.method` is called, Python automatically passes in the `o` object as the first parameter(generally called `self`).  In object-oriented lingo, `o` is *bound* to `method`, and indeedPython calls this object a *bound method*:```    &gt;&gt;&gt; o.method    &lt;bound method Outer.method of &lt;__main__.Outer object at 0x########&gt;&gt;```But that doesn't happen when `o.Inner` is called.  (It *does* pass ina `self`, but in this case it's the newly-created `Inner` object.)There's just no built-in way for the `o.Inner` object being constructedto *automatically* get a reference to `o`.  If you need one, you mustexplicitly pass one in, like so:```Pythonclass Outer(object):    def method(self):        pass    class Inner(object):        def __init__(self, outer):            self.outer = outero = Outer()o.method()i = o.Inner(o)```This seems redundant.  You don't have to pass in `o` explicitly to method calls,why should you have to pass it in explicitly to inner classes?Well--now you don't have to!You just decorate the inner class with `@big.BoundInnerClass`,and `BoundInnerClass` takes care of the rest!#### Using bound inner classesLet's modify the above example to use our [`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)decorator:```Pythonfrom big import BoundInnerClassclass Outer(object):    def method(self):        pass    @BoundInnerClass    class Inner(object):        def __init__(self, outer):            self.outer = outero = Outer()o.method()i = o.Inner()```Notice that `Inner.__init__` now requires an `outer` parameter,even though you didn't pass in any arguments to `o.Inner`.When it's called, `o` is magically passed in to `outer`!Thanks, [`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)!  You've saved the day!Decorating an inner class like this always adds a second positionalparameter, after `self`.  And, like `self`, you don't haveto use the name `outer`, you can use any name you like.(Although it's probably a good idea, for consistency's sakes.)#### InheritanceBound inner classes get slightly complicated when mixed with inheritance.It's not all that difficult, you merely need to obey the following rules:1. *A bound inner class can inherit normally from any unbound class.*2. *To subclass from a bound inner class while still inside the outerclass scope, or when referencing the inner class from the outer class(as opposed to an instance of the outer class), you must actuallysubclass or reference `classname.cls`.*  This is because inside theouter class, the &quot;class&quot; you see is actually an instance of a[`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls) object.3. *All classes that inherit from a bound inner class must always call thesuperclass's `__init__`. You don't need to pass in the `outer` parameter;it'll be automatically passed in to the superclass's `__init__` as before.*4. *An inner class that inherits from a bound inner class, and which alsowants to be bound to the outer object, should be decorated with[`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls).*5. *An inner class that inherits from a bound inner class, but doesn'twant to be bound to the outer object, should be decorated with[`UnboundInnerClass`](#unboundinnerclasscls).*Restating the last two rules: every class that descends from any[`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)should be decorated with either[`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)or[`UnboundInnerClass`](#unboundinnerclasscls).Which one you use depends on what behavior you want--whether ornot you want your inner subclass to automatically get the `outer`instance passed in to its `__init__`.Here's a simple example using inheritance with bound inner classes:```Pythonfrom big import BoundInnerClass, UnboundInnerClassclass Outer(object):    @BoundInnerClass    class Inner(object):        def __init__(self, outer):            self.outer = outer    @UnboundInnerClass    class ChildOfInner(Inner.cls):        def __init__(self):            super().__init__()o = Outer()i = o.ChildOfInner()```We followed the rules:* `Inner` inherits from object; since object isn't a bound inner class,  there are no special rules about inheritance `Inner` needs to obey.* `ChildOfInner` inherits from `Inner.cls`, not `Inner`.* Since `ChildOfInner` inherits from a  [`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls),  it must be  decorated with either [`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)  or [`UnboundInnerClass`](#unboundinnerclasscls).  It doesn't want the outer object passed in, so it's decorated  with [`UnboundInnerClass`](#unboundinnerclasscls).* `ChildOfInner.__init__` calls `super().__init__`.Note that, because `ChildOfInner` is decorated with[`UnboundInnerClass`](#unboundinnerclasscls),it doesn't take an `outer` parameter.  Nor does it pass in an `outer`argument when it calls `super().__init__`.  But when the constructor for`Inner` is called, the correct `outer` parameter is passed in--like magic!Thanks again, [`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)!If you wanted `ChildOfInner` to also get the outer argument passed in toits `__init__`, just decorate it with [`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)instead of[`UnboundInnerClass`](#unboundinnerclasscls),like so:```Pythonfrom big import BoundInnerClassclass Outer(object):    @BoundInnerClass    class Inner(object):        def __init__(self, outer):            self.outer = outer    @BoundInnerClass    class ChildOfInner(Inner.cls):        def __init__(self, outer):            super().__init__()            assert self.outer == outero = Outer()i = o.ChildOfInner()```Again, `ChildOfInner.__init__` doesn't need to explicitlypass in `outer` when calling `super.__init__`.You can see more complex examples of using inheritance with[`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)(and [`UnboundInnerClass`](#unboundinnerclasscls))in the **big** test suite.#### Miscellaneous notes* If you refer to a bound inner class directly from the outer *class,*  rather than using the outer *instance,* you get the original class.  This ensures that references to `Outer.Inner` are consistent; this  class is also a base class of all the bound inner classes. Additionally,  if you attempt to construct an instance of an unbound `Outer.Inner`  class without referencing it via an instance, you must pass in the  outer parameter by hand--just like you'd have to pass in the `self`  parameter by hand when calling a method on the *class itself* rather  than on an *instance* of the class.* If you refer to a bound inner class from an outer instance,  you get a subclass of the original class.* Bound classes are cached in the outer object, which both provides  a small speedup and ensures that `isinstance` relationships are  consistent.* You must not rename inner classes decorated with either  [`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)  or [`UnboundInnerClass`](#unboundinnerclasscls)!  The implementation of  [`BoundInnerClass`](#boundinnerclasscls)  looks up  the bound inner class in the outer object by name in several places.  Adding aliases to bound inner classes is harmless, but the original  attribute name must always work.* Bound inner classes from different objects are different classes.  This is symmetric with bound methods; if you have two objects  `a` and `b` that are instances of the same class,  `a.BoundInnerClass != b.BoundInnerClass`, just as `a.method != b.method`.* The binding only goes one level deep; if you had an inner class `C`  inside another inner class `B` inside a class `A`, the constructor  for `C` would be called with the `B` object, not the `A` object.* Similarly, if you have a bound inner class `B` inside a class `A`,  and another bound inner class `D` inside a class `C`, and `D`  inherits from `B`, the constructor for `D` will be called with  the `B` object but not the `A` object. When `D` calls `super().__init__`  it'll have to fill in the `outer` parameter by hand.* There's a race condition in the implementation: if you access a  bound inner class through an outer instance from two separate threads,  and the bound inner class was not previously cached, the two threads  may get different (but equivalent) bound inner class objects, and only  one of those instances will get cached on the outer object.  This could  lead to confusion and possibly cause bugs. For example, you could have  two objects that would be considered equal if they were instances of  the same bound inner class, but would not be considered equal if  instantiated by different instances of that same bound inner class.  There's an easy workaround for this problem: access the bound inner  class from the `__init__` of the outer class, which should allow  the code to cache the bound inner class instance before a second  thread could ever get a reference to the outer object.## Release history**0.9.1** *2023/0628** Added the new [`big.log`](#biglog) module, with its new [`Log`](#log) class!  I wrote this for another project--but it turned out so nice  I just had to add it to **big**!**0.9** *2023/06/15** Bugfix!  If an outer class `Outer` had an inner class `Inner`  decorated with `@BoundInnerClass`, and `o` is an instance of  `Outer`, and `o` evaluated to false in a boolean context,  `o.Inner` would be the *unbound* version of `Inner`.  Now  it's the bound version, as is proper.* Modified `tests/test_boundinnerclasses.py`:    - Added regression test for the above bugfix (of course!).    - It now takes advantage of that newfangled &quot;zero-argument `super`&quot;.    - Added testing of an unbound subclass of an unbound subclass.**0.8.3** *2023/06/11** Added  [`int_to_words`](#int_to_words-flowerytrue).* All tests now insert the local **big** directory  onto `sys.path`, so you can run the tests on your  local copy without having to install.  Especially  convenient for testing with old versions of Python!&gt; *Note:* tomorrow, **big** will be one year old!**0.8.2** *2023/05/19** Convert all iterator functions to use my new approach:  instead of checking arguments inside the iterator,  the function you call checks arguments, then has a  nested iterator function which it runs and returns the  result.  This means bad inputs raise their exceptions  at the call site where the iterator is constructed,  rather than when the first value is yielded by the iterator!**0.8.1** *2023/05/19** Added  [`parse_delimiters`](#parse_delimiterss-delimitersNone)  and  [`Delimiter`.](#delimiteropen-close--backslashfalse-nestedtrue)**0.8** *2023/05/18** Major retooling of `str` and `bytes` support in `big.text`.  * Functions in `big.text` now uniformly accept `str` or `bytes`    or a subclass of either.  See the    [Support for bytes and str](#Support-for-bytes-and-str) section    for how it works.  * Functions in `big.text` are now more consistent about raising    `TypeError` vs `ValueError`.  If you mix `bytes` and `str`    objects together in one call, you'll get a `TypeError`, but    if you pass in an empty iterable (of a correct type) where    a non-empty iterable is required you'll get a `ValueError`.    `big.text` generally tries to give the `TypeError` higher    priority; if you pass in a value that fails both the type    check and the value check, the `big.text` function will raise    `TypeError` first.* Major rewrite of  [`re_rpartition`.](#re_rpartitiontext-pattern-count1--flags0)  I realized it had the same &quot;reverse mode&quot; problem that  I fixed in  [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)  back in version **0.6.10**: the regular expression should really  search the string in &quot;reverse mode&quot;, from right to left.  The difference is whether the regular  expression potentially matches against overlapping strings.  When in forwards mode, the regular expression should prefer  the *leftmost* overlapping match, but in reverse mode it  should prefer the *rightmost* overlapping match.  Most of the  time this produces the same list of matches as you'd  find searching the string forwards--but sometimes the matches come  out *very* different.  This was way harder to fix with `re_rpartition` than with `multisplit`,  because Python's `re` module only supports searching forwards.  I have to emulate reverse-mode searching by manually checking for  overlapping matches and figuring out which one(s) to keep--a *lot* of  work!  Fortunately it's only a minor speed hit if you don't have  overlapping matches.  (And if you *do* have overlapping matches,  you're probably just happy `re_rpartition` now produces correct  results--though I did my best to make it performant anyway.)  In the future, **big** will probably add support for the  PyPI package `regex`, which reimplements Python's `re` module  but adds many features... including reverse mode!* New function:  [`reversed_re_finditer`.](#reversed_re_finditerpattern-string-flags0)  Behaves almost identically to the Python  standard library function `re.finditer`, yielding  non-overlapping matches of `pattern` in `string`.  The difference  is, `reversed_re_finditer` searches `string` from right to left.  (Written as part of the  [`re_rpartition`](#re_rpartitiontext-pattern-count1--flags0)  rewrite mentioned above.)* Added `apostrophes`, `double_quotes`,  `ascii_apostrophes`, `ascii_double_quotes`,  `utf8_apostrophes`, and `utf8_double_quotes`  to the `big.text` module.  Previously the first  four of these were hard-coded strings inside  [`gently_title`.](#gently_titles-apostrophesnone-double_quotesnone)  (And the last two didn't exist!)* Code cleanup in `split_text_with_code`, removed redundant code.  I think it has about the same number of `if` statements; if anything  it might be slightly faster.* Retooled  [`re_partition`](#re_partitiontext-pattern-count1--flags0)  and  [`re_rpartition`](#re_rpartitiontext-pattern-count1--flags0)  slightly, should now be very-slightly faster.  (Well, `re_rpartition`  will be slower if your pattern finds overlapping matches.  But at  least now it's correct!)* Lots and lots of doc improvements, as usual.**0.7.1** *2023/03/13** Tweaked the implementation of  [`multisplit`.](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)  Internally, it does the  string splitting using `re.split`, which returns a `list`.  It used  to iterate over the list and yield each element.  But that meant keeping  the entire list around in memory until `multisplit` exited.  Now,  [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)  reverses the list, pops off the final element, and yields  that.  This means  [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)  drops all references to the split strings  as it iterates over the string, which may help in low-memory situations.* Minor doc fixes.**0.7** *2023/03/11** Breaking changes to the  [`Scheduler`](#schedulerregulatordefault_regulator):  * It's no longer thread-safe by default, which means it's much faster    for non-threaded workloads.  * The lock has been moved out of the    [`Scheduler`](#schedulerregulatordefault_regulator)    object and into the    [`Regulator`](#regulator).  Among other things, this    means that the    [`Scheduler`](#schedulerregulatordefault_regulator)    constructor no longer takes a `lock` argument.  * [`Regulator`](#regulator) is now an abstract base class.    `big.scheduler` also provides two concrete implementations:    [`SingleThreadedRegulator`](#singlethreadedregulator)    and    [`ThreadSafeRegulator`](#threadsaferegulator).  * [`Regulator`](#regulator) and    [`Event`](#eventscheduler-event-time-priority-sequence)    are now defined in the `big.scheduler` namespace.  They were    previously defined inside the `Scheduler` class.  * The arguments to the    [`Event`](#eventscheduler-event-time-priority-sequence)    constructor were rearranged.  (You shouldn't care, as you    shouldn't be manually constructing    [`Event`](#eventscheduler-event-time-priority-sequence)    objects anyway.)  * The `Scheduler` now guarantees that it will only call `now` and `wake`    on a `Regulator` object while holding that `Regulator`'s lock.* Minor doc fixes.**0.6.18** *2023/03/09** Retooled  [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)  and  [`multistrip`](#multistrips-separators-leftTrue-rightTrue)  argument verification code.  Both functions now consistently check all  their inputs, and use consistent error messages when raising an exception.**0.6.17** *2023/03/09** Fixed a minor crashing bug in  [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse):  if you passed in a *list* of separators (or `separators`  was of any non-hashable type), and `reverse` was true,  `multisplit` would crash.  It used `separators` as a key  into a dict, which meant `separators` had to be hashable.* [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)  now verifies that the `s` passed in is either `str` or `bytes`.* Updated all copyright date notices to 2023.* Lots of doc fixes.**0.6.16** *2023/02/26** Fixed Python 3.6 support! Some equals-signs-in-f-strings and some  other anachronisms had crept in.  0.6.16 has been tested on all  versions from 3.6 to 3.11 (as well as having 100% *coverage*).* Made the `dateutils` package an optional dependency.  Only one function  needs it, [`parse_timestamp_3339Z()`](#parse_timestamp_3339zs--timezonenone).* Minor cleanup in [`PushbackIterator()`](#pushbackiteratoriterablenone).  It also uses slots now, which should make it a bit faster.**0.6.15** *2023/01/07** Added the new functions  [`datetime_ensure_timezone(d, timezone)`](#datetime_ensure_timezoned-timezone) and  [`datetime_set_timezone(d, timezone)`](#datetime_set_timezoned-timezone).  These allow you to ensure or explicitly set a timezone on a `datetime.datetime`  object.* Added the `timezone` argument to   [`parse_timestamp_3339Z()`](#parse_timestamp_3339zs--timezonenone).* [`gently_title()`](#gently_titles-apostrophesnone-double_quotesnone)  now capitalizes the first letter after a left parenthesis.* Changed the secret `multirpartition` function slightly.  Its `reverse`  parameter now means to un-reverse its reversing behavior.  Stated  another way, `multipartition(reverse=X)` and `multirpartition(reverse=not X)`  now do the same thing.**0.6.14** *2022/12/11** Improved the text of the `RuntimeError` raised by `TopologicalSorter.View`  when the view is incoherent.  Now it tells you exactly what nodes are  conflicting.* Expanded the deep dive on `multisplit`.**0.6.13** *2022/12/11** Changed [`translate_filename_to_exfat(s)`](#translate_filename_to_exfats)  behavior: when modifying a string with a colon (`':'`) *not* followed by  a space, it used to convert it to a dash (`'-'`).  Now it converts the  colon to a period (`'.'`), which looks a little more natural.  A colon  followed by a space is still converted to a dash followed by a space.**0.6.12** *2022/12/04** Bugfix: When calling  [`TopologicalSorter.print()`](#topologicalsorterprintprintprint),  it sorts the list of nodes, for consistency's sakes.  But if the node objects don't support `&lt;` or `&gt;` comparison,  that throws an exception.  `TopologicalSorter.print()` now catches  that exception and simply * Added a secret (otherwise undocumented!) function: `multirpartition`,  which is like  [`multipartition`](#multipartitions-separators-count1--reverseFalse-separateTrue)  but with `reverse=True`.* Added the list of conflicted nodes to the &quot;node is incoherent&quot;  exception text.&gt; *Note:* although version **0.6.12** was tagged, it was never packaged for release.**0.6.11**  *2022/11/13** Changed the import strategy.  The top-level **big** module used  to import all its child modules, and `import *` all the symbols  from all those modules.  But a friend (hi Mark Shannon!) talked  me out of this.  It's convenient, but if a user doesn't care about  a particular module, why make them import it.  So now the top-level  **big** module contains nothing but a version number, and you  can either import just the submodules you need, or you can import  **big.all** to get all the symbols (like **big** itself used to do).&gt; *Note:* although version **0.6.11** was tagged, it was never packaged for release.**0.6.10** *2022/10/26** All code changes had to do with  [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse):    * Fixed a subtle bug.  When splitting with a separator that can overlap      itself, like `' x '`, `multisplit` will prefer the *leftmost* instance.      But when `reverse=True`, it must prefer the *rightmost* instance.      Thanks to Eric V. Smith for suggesting the clever &quot;reverse everything,      call `re.split`, and un-reverse everything&quot; approach that meant I could      fix this bug while still implementing on top of `re.split`!    * Implemented `PROGRESSIVE` mode for the `strip` keyword.  This behaves      like `str.strip`: when splitting, strip on the left, then start splitting.      If we don't exhaust `maxsplit`, strip on the right; if we *do* exhaust      `maxsplit`, *don't* strip on the right.  (Similarly for `str.rstrip`      when `reverse=True`.)    * Changed the default for `strip` to `False`.  It used to be      `NOT_SEPARATE`.  But this was too surprising--I'd forget that it      was the default, and turning on `keep` wouldn't return everything I      thought I should get, and I'd head off to debug `multisplit`, when in      fact it was behaving as specified.  The Principle Of Least Surprise      tells me that `strip` defaulting to `False` is less surprising.      Also, maintaining the invariant that all the keyword-only parameters      to `multisplit` default to `False` is a helpful mnemonic device in      several ways.    * Removed `NOT_SEPARATE` (and the not-yet-implemented `STR_STRIP`)      modes for `strip`.  They're easy to implement yourself, and this      removes some surface area from the already-too-big      `multisplit` API.* Modernized `pyproject.toml` metadata to make `flit` happier.  This was  necessary to ensure that `pip install big` also installs its dependencies.**0.6.8** *2022/10/16** Renamed two of the three freshly-added lines modifier functions:  `lines_filter_contains` is now   [`lines_containing`](#lines_containingli-s--invertfalse),  and `lines_filter_grep` is now  [`lines_grep`](#lines_grepli-pattern--invertfalse-flags0).**0.6.7** *2022/10/16** Added three new lines modifier functions  to the [`text`](#bigtext) module:  `lines_filter_contains`,  `lines_filter_grep`,  and  [`lines_sort`](#lines_sortli--reversefalse).* [`gently_title`](#gently_titles-apostrophesnone-double_quotesnone)  now accepts `str` or `bytes`.  Also added the `apostrophes` and  `double_quotes` arguments.**0.6.6** *2022/10/14** Fixed a bug in  [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse).  I thought when using `keep=AS_PAIRS` that it shouldn't ever emit a 2-tuple  containing just empty strings--but on further reflection I've realized that  that's correct.  This behavior is now tested and documented, along with  the reasoning behind it.* Added the `reverse` flag to  [`re_partition`](#re_partitiontext-pattern-count1--flags0-reversefalse).* `whitespace_without_dos` and `newlines_without_dos` still had the DOS  end-of-line sequence in them!  Oops!    * Added a unit test to check that.  The unit test also ensures that      `whitespace`, `newlines`, and all the variants (`utf8_`, `ascii_`,      and `_with_dos`) exactly match the set of characters Python considers      whitespace and newline characters.* Lots more documentation and formatting fixes.**0.6.5** *2022/10/13** Added the new [`itertools`](#bigitertools) module, which so far only contains  [`PushbackIterator`](#pushbackiteratoriterablenone).* Added  [`lines_strip_comments`](#lines_strip_commentsli-comment_separators--quotes--backslash-rstriptrue-triple_quotestrue)  and  [`split_quoted_strings`](#split_quoted_stringss-quotes---triple_quotestrue-backslash)  to the  [`text`](#bigtext)  module.**0.6.1** *2022/10/13** I realized that [`whitespace`](#whitespace) should contain the DOS end-of-line  sequence (`'\r\n'`), as it should be considered a single separator  when splitting etc.  I added that, along with [`whitespace_no_dos`](#whitespace),  and naturally [`utf8_whitespace_no_dos`](#whitespace) and  [`ascii_whitespace_no_dos`](#whitespace) too.* Minor doc fixes.**0.6** *2022/10/13*A **big** upgrade!* Completely retooled and upgraded  [`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse),  and added  [`multistrip`](#multistrips-separators-leftTrue-rightTrue)  and  [`multipartition`,](#multipartitions-separators-count1--reverseFalse-separateTrue)  collectively called  [**The `multi-` family of functions.**](#The-multi--family-of-functions)  (Thanks to Eric Smith for suggesting  [`multipartition`!](#multipartitions-separators-count1--reverseFalse-separateTrue)  Well, sort of.)  * `[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)`    now supports five (!) keyword-only parameters, allowing the caller    to tune its behavior to an amazing degree.  * Also, the original implementation of    `[`multisplit`](#multisplits-separators--keepFalse-maxsplit-1-reverseFalse-separateFalse-stripFalse)`    got its semantics a bit wrong; it was inconsistent and maybe a little buggy.  * [`multistrip`](#multistrips-separators-leftTrue-rightTrue)    is like `str.strip` but accepts an iterable of    separator strings.  It can strip from the left, right, both, or    neither (in which case it does nothing).  * [`multipartition`](#multipartitions-separators-count1--reverseFalse-separateTrue)    is like `str.partition`, but accepts an iterable    of separator strings.  It can also partition more than once,    and supports `reverse=True` which causes it to partition from the right    (like `str.rpartition`).  * Also added useful predefined lists of separators for use with all    the `multi` functions: [`whitespace`](#whitespace) and [`newlines`](#newlines),    with `ascii_` and `utf8_` versions of each, and `without_dos` variants of    all three [`newlines`](#newlines) variants.* Added the  [`Scheduler`](#schedulerregulatornone)  and  [`Heap`](#heapinone)  classes.  [`Scheduler`](#schedulerregulatornone)  is a replacement for Python's `sched.scheduler` class, with a modernized  interface and a major upgrade in functionality.  [`Heap`](#heapinone)  is an object-oriented interface to Python's `heapq` module, used by  [`Scheduler`](#schedulerregulatornone).  These are in their own modules.* Added  [`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs)  and all the `lines_` modifiers.  These are great for writing little text parsers.  For more information, please see the deep-dive on  [**`lines` and lines modifier functions.**](#lines-and-lines-modifier-functions)* Removed`stripped_lines` and `rstripped_lines` from the `text` module,  as they're superceded by the far superior  [`lines`](#liness-separatorsnone--line_number1-column_number1-tab_width8-kwargs)  family.* Enhanced  [`normalize_whitespace`](#normalize_whitespaces-separatorsNone-replacementNone).  Added the `separators` and `replacement` parameters,  and added support for `bytes` objects.* Added the `count` parameter to  [`re_partition`](#re_partitiontext-pattern-count1--flags0)  and  [`re_rpartition`](#re_rpartitiontext-pattern-count1--flags0).**0.5.2** *2022/09/12** Added `stripped_lines` and `rstripped_lines` to the [`text`](#bigtext) module.* Added support for `len` to the [`TopologicalSorter`](#topologicalsortergraphnone) object.**0.5.1** *2022/09/04** Added  [`gently_title`](#gently_titles-apostrophesnone-double_quotesnone)  and  [`normalize_whitespace`](#normalize_whitespaces-separatorsNone-replacementNone)  to the [`text`](#bigtext) module.* Changed [`translate_filename_to_exfat`](#translate_filename_to_exfats)  to handle translating `':'` in a special way.  If the colon is followed by a space, then the colon is turned into `' -'`.  This yields a more natural translation when colons are used in text, e.g.  `'xXx: The Return Of Xander Cage'` is translated to `'xXx - The Return Of Xander Cage'`.  If the colon is not followed by a space, turns the colon into `'-'`.  This is good for tiresome modern gobbledygook like `'Re:code'`, which  will now be translated to `'Re-code'`.**0.5** *2022/06/12** Initial release.</longdescription>
