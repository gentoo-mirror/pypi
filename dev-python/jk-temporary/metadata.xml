	<longdescription>jk_temporary============Introduction------------This python module is a collection of utility functions and classes to manage temporary data.Information about this module can be found here:* [github.org](https://github.com/jkpubsrc/python-module-jk-temporary)* [pypi.python.org](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jk_temporary)The functions this module provides----------------------------------This module provides the following functions:```python## Create a path for a temporary file or directory.## @paramstring baseDirPathThe base directory the file should reside in.# @paramstring prefixA prefix to prepend the random file (or directory) name part.# @paramint randomNameLengthThe length in characters of the random file (or directory) name part to create.# @paramstring postfixA postfix to append the random file (or directory) name part.# @returnstringReturns a file (or directory) path. No checking is performed if this file or directory already exists.# This method just creates the path.#def createRandomFilePath(baseDirPath = &quot;/tmp&quot;, prefix = 'tmp_', randomNameLength = 32, postfix = '')``````python## Create a unique new temporary directory.## @paramstring baseDirPathThe directory that serves as a parent for the new directory to create.# @paramstring prefixA prefix to prepend the random directory name part.# @paramint randomNameLengthThe length in characters of the random directory name part to create.# @paramstring postfixA postfix to append the random directory name part.# @paramint dirModeThe UNIX/Linux mode the directory should have on creation.#This is 0700 by default to ensure that other users can not read or write to the new directory.# @returnstringReturns a unique path to a directory that just has been created.#def createTempDir(baseDirPath = &quot;/tmp&quot;, prefix = 'tmp_', randomNameLength = 32, postfix = '', dirMode = 0o700)``````python## Create a unique new temporary file ready for later writing.# Please note that temporary file names are generated using a RNG. That implies that if you do not write# to that file after a call to this function an additional call to &lt;c&gt;createTempFilePath()&lt;/c&gt; could produce the same# file name again. If &lt;c&gt;randomNameLength&lt;/c&gt;# is large enough this is quite unlikely and not a real problem, but you should recognize that at least in# theory this phenomenon can occur.## @paramstring baseDirPathThe directory that serves as a parent for the new directory to create.# @paramint randomNameLengthThe length in characters of the random file name part to create.# @paramstring prefixA prefix to prepend the random file name part.# @paramstring postfixA postfix to append the random file name part.# @paramint fileModeThe UNIX/Linux mode the file should have on creation.#This is 0600 by default to ensure that other users can not read or write to the new file.# @returnstringReturns  the unique path to a file that just has been created.#def createTempFilePath(baseDirPath = &quot;/tmp&quot;, prefix = 'tmp_', randomNameLength = 32, postfix = '', fileMode = 0o600)``````python## Create a unique new temporary file ready for later writing.## @paramstring baseDirPathThe directory that serves as a parent for the new directory to create.# @paramint randomNameLengthThe length in characters of the random file name part to create.# @paramstring prefixA prefix to prepend the random file name part.# @paramstring postfixA postfix to append the random file name part.# @paramint fileModeThe UNIX/Linux mode the file should have on creation.#This is 0600 by default to ensure that other users can not read or write to the new file.# @returnstringReturns  the unique path to a file that just has been created.#def createTempFile(baseDirPath = &quot;/tmp&quot;, prefix = 'tmp_', randomNameLength = 32, postfix = '', fileMode = 0o600)``````python## Create a unique new temporary file ready for immediate writing.## @paramstring baseDirPathThe directory that serves as a parent for the new directory to create.# @paramint randomNameLengthThe length in characters of the random file name part to create.# @paramstring prefixA prefix to prepend the random file name part.# @paramstring postfixA postfix to append the random file name part.# @paramint fileModeThe UNIX/Linux mode the file should have on creation.#This is 0600 by default to ensure that other users can not read or write to the new file.# @returntupleReturns a tuple consisting of two elements:#- the unique path to a file that just has been created#- the open file handle#def createTempFileUTF8(baseDirPath = &quot;/tmp&quot;, prefix = 'tmp_', randomNameLength = 32, postfix = '', fileMode = 0o600)``````python## Create a unique new temporary file ready for immediate writing.## @paramstring baseDirPathThe directory that serves as a parent for the new directory to create.# @paramint randomNameLengthThe length in characters of the random file name part to create.# @paramstring prefixA prefix to prepend the random file name part.# @paramstring postfixA postfix to append the random file name part.# @paramint fileModeThe UNIX/Linux mode the file should have on creation.#This is 0600 by default to ensure that other users can not read or write to the new file.# @returntupleReturns a tuple consisting of two elements:#- the unique path to a file that just has been created#- the open file handle#def createTempFileBinary(baseDirPath = &quot;/tmp&quot;, prefix = 'tmp_', randomNameLength = 32, postfix = '', fileMode = 0o600)```The object ``TempDir`` this module provides-------------------------------------------This module provides the class ``TempDir`` that contains the following methods:```python## Constructor method.## @paramstringbaseDirPathThe directory that serves as a parent for the new files and directories to create.# @paramstringnamePrefixA prefix to prepend the random file name part.
