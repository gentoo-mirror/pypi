A YAML file containing the pyreason rules (required)3. A YAML file containing the pyreason facts (optional but recommended)4. A YAML file containing the pyreason labels (optional but recommended)5. A YAML file containing the pyreason ipl (inconsistent predicate list) (optional)The format of these files is very important. Please refer to the [example YAML files provided](https://github.com/lab-v2/pyreason/blob/main/pyreason/examples/example_yamls) when making your own rules/facts/labels/ipl. TODO: make doc for each format.## 2.
