Summer 2019 on Long Island). I was mindlessly scrolling Instagram for the 1000th hour that week and thought, &quot;How could I access this data programatically?&quot;. After 30 seconds of searching it became clear that Instagram's API was not going to be of any use so I was going to have to figure it out myself, and thus the beginning of instascrape was born. --&gt;DISCLAIMER: _With great power comes great responsibility_. This is a research project and I am not responsible for how you use it. Independently, the library is designed to be responsible and respectful and it is up to you to decide what you do with it. &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;media/logopic.png&quot; width=&quot;150px&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</longdescription>
