	<longdescription># resoto-plugin-protectorProtector Plugin for ResotoThis plugin protects important resources from deletion by Resoto.## UsageIn `resh` execute```&gt; config edit resoto.worker```and find the following section```plugin_protector:  # Configuration for the plugin  # See https://github.com/someengineering/resoto/tree/main/plugins/protector for syntax details  config:    aws:      '110465657741':        us-east-1:          aws_ec2_instance:            - 'i-0fcbe8974615bfd37'  # Enable plugin?  enabled: false```The format of the `config` section is as follows:```cloud.id:  account.id:    region.id:      kind:        - resource.id```### Implementation detailsEach Resoto resource has an attributed `/metadata.protected` which takes a boolean value. By default it is set to `false`. Each Resoto resource inherits BaseResource which contains two methods for cleaning up a resource, `cleanup()` and `delete()`. Both those methods will refuse to manipulate a resource once the `protected` attribute has been set to `true`. Meaning if a resource is marked as protected but has also been flagged for cleanup the cleanup will fail because protected resources cannot be deleted.</longdescription>
