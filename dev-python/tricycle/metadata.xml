It hasn't necessarilybeen reviewed or tested to Trio's standards, it supports at minimumPython 3.7, and some features might not be available on PyPy or onWindows.* If you find that it meets your needs, you're welcome to use it. We'll  endeavor to provide a (short) deprecation period on API changes, but  no guarantees on that yet.* If you find that it doesn't meet your needs, feel free to `let us know  &lt;https://github.com/oremanj/tricycle/issues&gt;`__, but don't say you  weren't warned. :-)Currently we have:* a readers-writer lock (``tricycle.RWLock``)* slightly higher-level stream wrappers (``tricycle.BufferedReceiveStream``  and ``tricycle.TextReceiveStream``)* some tools for managing cancellation (``tricycle.open_service_nursery()``  and ``tricycle.MultiCancelScope``)* a way to make objects that want to keep background tasks running during the  object's lifetime (``tricycle.BackgroundObject`` and the more general  ``tricycle.ScopedObject``)* [watch this space!]License and history~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~``tricycle`` is licensed under your choice of the MIT or Apache 2.0 license.See `LICENSE &lt;https://github.com/oremanj/tricycle/blob/master/LICENSE&gt;`__for details.This library has its origins in a package of utilities that the authorwrote at `Hudson River Trading &lt;http://www.hudson-trading.com/&gt;`__while building things for them with Trio. Many thanks to HRT forsupporting open source in this way!</longdescription>
