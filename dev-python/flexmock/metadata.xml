There are no external dependencies.- **Simple and intuitive**: Declarations are structured to read more like English sentences than API calls, so they are easy to learn and use.- **Fully type annotated**: External API is fully type annotated so it works great with static analysis tools and editor auto-completion.- **Integrations with test runners**: Integrates seamlessly with all major test runners like unittest, doctest, and pytest.- **Python 3.6+ and PyPy3**: Extensively tested to work with latest Python versions.## InstallationInstall with pip:```pip install flexmock```## ExamplesFlexmock features smooth integration with pretty much every popular test runner, so no special setup is necessary. Simply importing flexmock into your test module is sufficient to get started with any of the following examples:```pythonfrom flexmock import flexmock```### MocksAssertions take many flavors and flexmock has many different facilities to generate them:```python# Simplest is ensuring that a certain method is calledflexmock(Train).should_receive(&quot;get_tickets&quot;).once()# Of course, it is also possible to provide a default return valueflexmock(Train).should_receive(&quot;get_destination&quot;).and_return(&quot;Paris&quot;).once()# Or check that a method is called with specific argumentsflexmock(Train).should_receive(&quot;set_destination&quot;).with_args(&quot;Seoul&quot;).at_least().twice()```### SpiesInstead of mocking, there are also times when you want to execute the actual method and simply find out how many times it was called. Flexmock uses `should_call` to generate this sort of assertions instead of `should_receive`:```python# Verify that a method is called at most three timesflexmock(Train).should_call(&quot;get_tickets&quot;).at_most().times(3)# Make sure that a method is never called with specific argumentsflexmock(Train).should_call(&quot;set_destination&quot;).with_args(&quot;Helsinki&quot;).never()# More complex example with features like argument type and exception matchingflexmock(Train).should_call(&quot;crash&quot;).with_args(str, int).and_raise(AttributeError).once()```See more examples in the documentation.## DocumentationUser guide, examples, and a full API reference is available at: https://flexmock.readthedocs.io## ContributingContributions are absolutely welcome and encouraged!
