	<longdescription>Sitemap=======[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/pelican-plugins/sitemap/main.yml?branch=main)](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/sitemap/actions)[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pelican-sitemap)](https://pypi.org/project/pelican-sitemap/)![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/pelican-sitemap?color=blue)This [Pelican][] plugin generates a site map in plain-text or XML format. You can use the `SITEMAP` variable in your settings file to configure the behavior of the plugin.Installation------------This plugin can be installed via:    python -m pip install pelican-sitemapUsage-----The `SITEMAP` setting must be a Python dictionary and can contain these keys:* `format`, which sets the output format of the plugin (`xml` or `txt`)* `priorities`, which is a dictionary with three keys:    - `articles`, the priority for the URLs of the articles and their translations    - `pages`, the priority for the URLs of the static pages    - `indexes`, the priority for the URLs of the index pages, such as tags, author pages, categories indexes, archives, etc.    All the values of this dictionary must be decimal numbers between `0` and `1`.* `changefreqs`, which is a dictionary with three items:    - `articles`, the update frequency of the articles    - `pages`, the update frequency of the pages    - `indexes`, the update frequency of the index pages    Valid frequency values are `always`, `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly` and `never`.* `exclude`, which is a list of regular expressions that will be used to exclude matched URLs from the sitemap if *any* of them match. For example:```pythonSITEMAP = {    &quot;exclude&quot;: [        &quot;^/noindex/&quot;,  # starts with &quot;/noindex/&quot;        &quot;/tag/&quot;,       # contains &quot;/tag/&quot;        &quot;\.json$&quot;,     # ends with &quot;.json&quot;    ]}```If a key is missing or a value is incorrect, it will be replaced with the default value.You can also exclude an individual URL by adding metadata to it, setting `private` to `True`.The sitemap is saved in: `&lt;output_path&gt;/sitemap.&lt;format&gt;`&gt; **Note:** `priorities` and `changefreqs` are information for search engines and are only used in the XML site maps. For more information, see: &lt;https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#xmlTagDefinitions&gt;**Example**Here is an example configuration (it is also the default settings):```pythonSITEMAP = {    &quot;format&quot;: &quot;xml&quot;,    &quot;priorities&quot;: {        &quot;articles&quot;: 0.5,        &quot;indexes&quot;: 0.5,        &quot;pages&quot;: 0.5    },    &quot;changefreqs&quot;: {        &quot;articles&quot;: &quot;monthly&quot;,        &quot;indexes&quot;: &quot;daily&quot;,        &quot;pages&quot;: &quot;monthly&quot;    }}```Contributing------------Contributions are welcome and much appreciated.
