The storage format and libraries might be changed in    backward-incompatible ways and are not subject to any SLA or deprecation    policy... warning::    **Alpha-Release Notice**    This is a fork created by Mira Geoscience for interoperability with the    geoh5 file format.Why?----An open-source serialization format and API library to support data interchangeacross the entire mining community.Scope-----This library provides an abstracted object-based interface to the underlyingOMF serialization format, which enables rapid development of the interface whileallowing for future changes under the hood.Goals------ The goal of Open Mining Format is to standardize data formats across the  mining community and promote collaboration- The goal of the API library is to provide a well-documented, object-based  interface for serializing OMF filesAlternatives------------OMF is intended to supplement the many alternative closed-source file formatsused in the mining community.Connections-----------This library makes use of the `properties &lt;https://github.com/seequent/properties&gt;`_open-source project, which is designed and publicly supported by`Seequent &lt;https://seequent.com&gt;`_.Connection to the geoh5 format makes use of `geoh5py &lt;https://geoh5py.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_publicly supported by `Mira Geoscience &lt;https://mirageoscience.com/&gt;`_Installation------------To install the repository, ensure that you have`pip installed &lt;https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/&gt;`_ and run:.. code:: bash    pip install omfOr from `github &lt;https://github.com/GMSGDataExchange/omf&gt;`_:.. code:: bash    git clone https://github.com/GMSGDataExchange/omf.git    cd omf    pip install -e .</longdescription>
