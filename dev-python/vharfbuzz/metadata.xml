	<longdescription># vharfbuzz - A user-friendlier way to use Harfbuzz in Python[uharfbuzz](https://github.com/harfbuzz/uharfbuzz) is an _awesome_ tool for shaping text in Python. But it wraps the Harfbuzz C interface quite closely, so still requires you to perform a bunch of boilerplate operations before you can get on with the shaping. This module allows you a slightly more high-level interface to the text shaping process. For example, rather than:```pythonwith open(sys.argv[1], 'rb') as fontfile:    fontdata = fontfile.read()text = sys.argv[2]face = hb.Face(fontdata)font = hb.Font(face)buf = hb.Buffer()buf.add_str(text)buf.guess_segment_properties()features = {&quot;kern&quot;: True, &quot;liga&quot;: True}hb.shape(font, buf, features)```with `vharfbuzz` you can just say:```pythonvhb = Vharfbuzz(sys.argv[1])buf = vhb.shape(sys.argv[2], {&quot;features&quot;: {&quot;kern&quot;: True, &quot;liga&quot;: True}})```The `Vharfbuzz` class also contains a number of other helpful methods to perform common operations on Harfbuzz buffers. See [Read The Docs](https://vharfbuzz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.## Installationvharfbuzz is available from `pypi`, so can be installed like so:    pip3 install vharfbuzzIf building from source, you can install it like so:    pip3 install -r requirements.txt    pip3 install .</longdescription>
