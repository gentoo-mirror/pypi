	<longdescription># pymonocypherThis python package uses cython to wrap the Monocypher C library. Monocypher is an easy to use, easy to deploy, auditable crypto librarywritten in portable C.  Normal Python installations have access to a wideselection of quality crypto libraries.  This python binding is intended tocommunicate with other implementations that do use the Monocypher library.A typical application is to communicate with a microcontroller that uses Monocypher.*   pymonocypher [Source code](https://github.com/jetperch/pymonocypher)*   Monocypher [official site](https://monocypher.org/)The Python binding API mirrors the underlying C API, but with simplifications to only pass bytes objects, not uint8_t * and length.## InstallationYou can install directly from pypi:    pip install pymonocypher    You can then use pymonocypher:    python    &gt;&gt;&gt; import monocypher    &gt;&gt;&gt; monocypher.blake2b(b'hello world')</longdescription>
