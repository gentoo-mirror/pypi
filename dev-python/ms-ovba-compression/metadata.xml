	<longdescription>[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Beakerboy/MS-OVBA-Compression/badge.png?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/Beakerboy/MS-OVBA-Compression?branch=main) ![Build Status](https://github.com/Beakerboy/MS-OVBA-Compression/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)# MS-OVBA-CompressionCompress or decompress data streams using the MS-OVBA compression algorithmMicrosoft Office files are zip archives that contain a variety of files that work together. One of these files is vbaProject.bin, a binary OLE container which includesany VBA source code in the project. The VBA sources are compressed using the MS-OVBA compression algorithm.It's worth noting that the compressed output may differ between this and a Microsoft Office applcation. The way the compression algorithm works, multiple validcompressed byte seqences are able to be decompressed into the same uncompressed stream. This project follows the algorithm documented in the [MS-OVBA specification](https://interoperability.blob.core.windows.net/files/MS-OVBA/%5bMS-OVBA%5d.pdf), while one of the test cases has a compressed containerthat is slightly different than is produced using it's own documented procedure.## InstallationUse the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install MS_OVBA_Compression.```bashpip install ms_ovba_compression```## UsageAll inputs and outputs are bytes objects. This library does not operate on files, but on compressed or uncompressed byte streams. Any raw VBA files require a certainamount of normalization before compression. If you are interested in writing or modifying the whole OLE container, refer to[Beakerboy/vbaProject-Compiler](https://github.com/Beakerboy/vbaProject-Compiler).```pythonfrom ms_ovba_compression.ms_ovba import MsOvba# returns b'\x01\x19°\x00abcdefgh\x00ijklmnop\x00qrstuv.'input = b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv.'ms_ovba = MsOvba()ms_ovba.compress(input)# returns b'#aaabcdefaaaaghijaaaaaklaaamnopqaaaaaaaaaaaarstuvwxyzaaa'ms_ovba = MsOvba()compressed = b'\x01/°\x00#aaabcde²f\x00paghij\x018\x08akl\x000mnop\x06q\x02p\x04\x10rstuv\x10wxyz\x00&lt;'ms_ovba.decompress(compressed)```The objects can be initialized to indicate the endianness if the default little-endian is not desired.```python# returns b'\x01°\x19\x00abcdefgh\x00ijklmnop\x00qrstuv.'input = b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv.'ms_ovba = MsOvba(&quot;big&quot;)ms_ovba.compress(input)```## ContributingPull requests are welcome.
