	<longdescription># Acquire`acquire` is a tool to quickly gather forensic artifacts from disk images or a live system into a lightweight container.This makes `acquire` an excellent tool to, among others, speedup the process of digital forensic triage.It uses `dissect` to gather that information from the raw disk, if possible.`acquire` gathers artifacts based on modules. These modules are paths or globs on a filesystem which acquire attempts to gather.Multiple modules can be executed at once, which have been collected together inside a profile.These profiles (used with `--profile`) are  `full`, `default`, `minimal` and `none`.Depending on what operating system gets detected, different artifacts are collected.The most basic usage of `acquire` is as follows:```bashuser@dissect~$ sudo acquire```The tool requires administrative access to read raw disk data instead of using the operating system for file access.However, there are some options available to use the operating system as a fallback option. (e.g `--fallback` or `--force-fallback`)For more information, please see [the documentation](https://docs.dissect.tools/en/latest/projects/acquire/index.html).## RequirementsThis project is part of the Dissect framework and requires Python.Information on the supported Python versions can be found in the Getting Started section of [the documentation](https://docs.dissect.tools/en/latest/index.html#getting-started).## Installation`acquire` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/acquire/).```bashpip install acquire```## Build and test instructionsThis project uses `tox` to build source and wheel distributions. Run the following command from the root folder to buildthese:```bashtox -e build```The build artifacts can be found in the `dist/` directory.`tox` is also used to run linting and unit tests in a self-contained environment. To run both linting and unit testsusing the default installed Python version, run:```bashtox```For a more elaborate explanation on how to build and test the project, please see [thedocumentation](https://docs.dissect.tools/en/latest/contributing/tooling.html).## ContributingThe Dissect project encourages any contribution to the codebase.
