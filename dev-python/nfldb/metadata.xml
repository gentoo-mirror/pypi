	<longdescription>Module nfldb provides command line tools and a library for maintainingand querying a relational database of play-by-play NFL data. The data isimported from `nflgame &lt;https://github.com/BurntSushi/nflgame&gt;`__, whichin turn gets its data from a JSON feed on NFL.com's live GameCenterpages. This data includes, but is not limited to, game schedules,scores, rosters and play-by-play data for every preseason, regularseason and postseason game dating back to 2009.Here is a small teaser that shows how to use nfldb to find the top fivepassers in the 2012 regular season:::    #!python    import nfldb    db = nfldb.connect()    q = nfldb.Query(db)    q.game(season_year=2012, season_type='Regular')    for pp in q.sort('passing_yds').limit(5).as_aggregate():        print pp.player, pp.passing_ydsAnd the output is:::    [andrew@Liger ~] python2 top-five.py    Drew Brees (NO, QB) 5177    Matthew Stafford (DET, QB) 4965    Tony Romo (DAL, QB) 4903    Tom Brady (NE, QB) 4799    Matt Ryan (ATL, QB) 4719In theory, both ``nfldb`` and ``nflgame`` provide access to the samedata. The difference is in the execution. In order to search data innflgame, a large JSON file needs to be read from disk and loaded intoPython data structures for each game. Conversely, nfldb's data is storedin a relational database, which can be searched and retrieved fasterthan nflgame by a few orders of magnitude. Moreover, the relationalorganization of data in nfldb allows for a convenient `queryinterface &lt;http://goo.gl/Sd6MN2&gt;`__ to search NFL play data.The database can be updated with real time data from active games byrunning the ``nfldb-update`` script included with this module as oftenas you're comfortable pinging NFL.com. (N.B. The JSON data itself onlyupdates every 15 seconds, so running ``nfldb-update`` faster than thatwould be wasteful.) Roster updates are done automatically at a minimuminterval of 12 hours.nfldb has `comprehensive APIdocumentation &lt;http://pdoc.burntsushi.net/nfldb&gt;`__ and a `wiki withexamples &lt;https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki&gt;`__.nfldb can be used in conjunction with`nflvid &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nflvid&gt;`__ to `search and watchNFL game footage &lt;http://goo.gl/Mckaf0&gt;`__.If you need help, please join us at our IRC channel ``#nflgame`` onFreeNode.</longdescription>
