	<longdescription># rac_schemasJSON schemas and validation helpers.## Requirements*   Python 3.4 or higher*   [jsonschema](https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)*   [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/) (for running tests)*   [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) (for running linters before committing)    *   After installing pre-commit, install the git-hook scripts:    ```    $ pre-commit install    ```## InstallationThe recommended way to install this package is using `pip`:```pip install rac_schemas```## UsageThis library has one main public method, `is_valid()`, which takes a dict as the first argument and a schema filename as the second.```from rac_schemas import is_validdata = {&quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot; ... }is_valid(data, &quot;object.json&quot;)````rac_schemas` will attempt to add an appropriate extension to schema filenames in cases where it is either missing or incorrect. For example, if either `schema` and `schema.org` as schema filenames, `rac_schemas` will attempt to open `schema.json`.Invalid data will raise a `jsonschema.exceptions.ValidationError`, and an invalid schema filename will raise a `FileNotFoundError`.### Available schemasAll schemas are located in the `schemas/` subdirectory of the `rac_schemas/` directory.#### Tests`rac_schemas` comes with unit tests as well as linting. The easiest way to make sure all tests pass is to run `tox` from the root of the repository. This will execute all tests, and will also run `autopep8` and `flake8` linters against the codebase.## DocumentationAutomatically generated HTML documentation in the `docs/` directory based upon `.json` files in the `schemas/` subdirectory of the `rac_schemas/` directory.A simplified overview of the data model is below:![Simplified data model overwiew](Simplified_Data_Model.png &quot;Data Model Overview&quot;)### Requirements*   Python 3.4 or higher*   [json-schema-for-humans](https://github.com/coveooss/json-schema-for-humans)## UsageRunning `generate_docs.py` will iterate over the `schemas/` subdirectory and write updated docs files to the `docs/` directory.## LicenseCode is released under an MIT license. See`LICENSE.md`.</longdescription>
