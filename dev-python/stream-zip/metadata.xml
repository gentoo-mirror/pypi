This is useful in memory-constrained environments, or when you would like to start returning compressed data before you've even retrieved all the uncompressed data. Generating ZIPs on-demand in a web server is a typical use case for stream-zip.Offers similar functionality to [zipfly](https://github.com/BuzonIO/zipfly), but with a different API, and does not use Python's zipfile module under the hood. Creates both Zip32/2.0/Legacy and Zip64 files.&lt;!-- --8&lt;-- [end:intro] --&gt;To unZIP files on the fly try [stream-unzip](https://github.com/uktrade/stream-unzip).&lt;!-- --8&lt;-- [start:features] --&gt;## FeaturesIn addition to being memory efficient (with some [limitations](https://stream-zip.docs.trade.gov.uk/getting-started/#limitations)) stream-zip:- Constructs ZIP files that can be stream unzipped, for example by [stream-unzip](https://stream-unzip.docs.trade.gov.uk/)- Can construct Zip64 ZIP files. Zip64 ZIP files allow sizes far beyond the approximate 4GiB limit of the original ZIP format- Can construct ZIP files that contain symbolic links- Can construct ZIP files that contain directories, including empty directories- Allows the specification of permissions on the member files and directories (although not all clients respect them)- By default stores modification time as an extended timestamp. An extended timestamp is a more accurate timestamp than the original ZIP format allows&lt;!-- --8&lt;-- [end:features] --&gt;---Visit the [stream-zip documentation](https://stream-zip.docs.trade.gov.uk/) for usage instructions.</longdescription>
