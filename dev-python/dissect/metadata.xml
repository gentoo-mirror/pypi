	<longdescription># dissectDissect is a digital forensics &amp; incident response framework and toolset that allows you to quickly access and analyse forensic artefacts from various disk and file formats, developed by Fox-IT (part of NCC Group).This project is a meta package, it will install all other Dissect modules with the right combination of versions. Formore information, please see [the documentation](https://docs.dissect.tools/).## What is Dissect?Dissect is an incident response framework build from various parsers and implementations of file formats. Tying this all together, Dissect allows you to work with tools named `target-query` and `target-shell` to quickly gain access to forensic artefacts, such as Runkeys, Prefetch files, and Windows Event Logs, just to name a few!**Singular approach**And the best thing: all in a singular way, regardless of underlying container (E01, VMDK, QCoW), filesystem (NTFS, ExtFS, FFS), or Operating System (Windows, Linux, ESXi) structure / combination. You no longer have to bother extracting files from your forensic container, mount them (in case of VMDKs and such), retrieve the MFT, and parse it using a separate tool, to finally create a timeline to analyse. This is all handled under the hood by Dissect in a user-friendly manner.If we take the example above, you can start analysing parsed MFT entries by just using a command like `target-query -f mft &lt;PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE&gt;`!**Create a lightweight container using Acquire**Dissect also provides you with a tool called `acquire`. You can deploy this tool on endpoint(s) to create a lightweight container of these machine(s). What is convenient as well, is that you can deploy `acquire` on a hypervisor to quickly create lightweight containers of all the (running) virtual machines on there! All without having to worry about file-locks. These lightweight containers can then be analysed using the tools like `target-query` and `target-shell`, but feel free to use other tools as well.**A modular setup**Dissect is made with a modular approach in mind. This means that each individual project can be used on its own (or in combination) to create a completely new tool for your engagement or future use!**Try it out now!**Interested in trying it out for yourself? You can simply `pip install dissect` and start using the `target-*` tooling right away. Or you can use the interactive playground at https://try.dissect.tools to try Dissect in your browser.Donâ€™t know where to start?

Run the following command from the root folder to buildthese:```bashtox -e build```The build artifacts can be found in the `dist/` directory.`tox` is also used to run linting and unit tests in a self-contained environment. To run both linting and unit testsusing the default installed Python version, run:```bashtox```For a more elaborate explanation on how to build and test the project, please see [thedocumentation](https://docs.dissect.tools/en/latest/contributing/developing.html#building-testing).## ContributingThe Dissect project encourages any contribution to the codebase.
