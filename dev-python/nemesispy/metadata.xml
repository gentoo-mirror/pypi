	<longdescription>This library contains routines for simulating and fittingexoplanet emission spectra at arbitrary orbital phase,thereby constraining the thermal structure and chemicalabundance of exoplanet atmospheres. It is also capableof fitting emission spectra at multiple orbital phases(phase curves) at the same time. This packagecomes ready with some spectral data and General CirculationModel (GCM) )data so you could start simulating spectrastraight away. There are a few demonstration routines inthe `nemesispy` folder; in particular `demo_fit_eclipse.py`contains an interactive plot routine which allows youto fit a hot Jupiter eclipse spectrum by hand by varyingits chemical abundance and temperature profile. This packagecan be easily integrated with a Bayesian sampler, in particular`MultiNest` for a full spectral retrieval.The radiative transfer calculations are done with thecorrelated-k approximation, and are accelerated with the`numba` just-in-time compiler to match the speed ofcompiled languages such as Fortran. The radiative transferroutines are based on the well-tested [Nemesis](https://github.com/nemesiscode) library developedby Patrick Irwin (University of Oxford) and collaborators.This package has the following advantageous features:* Highly portable and customisable compared  to packages written in compiled languages, and  can be easily installed on computer clusters.* Fast calculation speed due to just-in-time  compilation, which compiles Python code to machine  code at run time.* Radiative transfer routines are benchmarked against  the extensively used [Nemesis](https://github.com/nemesiscode) library.* Contains interactive plotting routines that allows you  to visualise the impact of gas abundance and thermal  structure on the emission spectra.* Contains routine to simulate spectra from General  Circulation Models (GCMs).* Contains unit tests so that you could check if the  the code is working properly after your modifications.</longdescription>
