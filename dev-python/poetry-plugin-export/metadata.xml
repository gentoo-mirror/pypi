	<longdescription># Poetry Plugin: Export[![Poetry](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://python-poetry.org/badge/v0.json)](https://python-poetry.org/)This package is a plugin that allows the export of locked packages to various formats.**Note**: For now, only the `constraints.txt` and `requirements.txt` formats are available.This plugin provides the same features as the existing `export` command of Poetry which it will eventually replace.## InstallationThe easiest way to install the `export` plugin is via the `self add` command of Poetry.```bashpoetry self add poetry-plugin-export```If you used `pipx` to install Poetry you can add the plugin via the `pipx inject` command.```bashpipx inject poetry poetry-plugin-export```Otherwise, if you used `pip` to install Poetry you can add the plugin packages via the `pip install` command.```bashpip install poetry-plugin-export```## UsageThe plugin provides an `export` command to export to the desired format.```bashpoetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt```**Note**: Only the `constraints.txt` and `requirements.txt` formats are currently supported.### Available options* `--format (-f)`: The format to export to (default: `requirements.txt`). Currently, only `constraints.txt` and `requirements.txt` are supported.* `--output (-o)`: The name of the output file.  If omitted, print to standard output.* `--without`: The dependency groups to ignore when exporting.* `--with`: The optional dependency groups to include when exporting.* `--only`: The only dependency groups to include when exporting.* `--default`: Only export the main dependencies. (**Deprecated**)* `--dev`: Include development dependencies. (**Deprecated**)* `--extras (-E)`: Extra sets of dependencies to include.* `--all-extras`: Include all sets of extra dependencies.* `--without-hashes`: Exclude hashes from the exported file.* `--with-credentials`: Include credentials for extra indices.</longdescription>
