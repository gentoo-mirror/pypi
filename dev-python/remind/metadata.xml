	<longdescription>Python Remind library=====================Python library to convert between `Remind &lt;https://dianne.skoll.ca/projects/remind/&gt;`_ and iCalendar.Can be used stand alone (provided rem2ics and ics2rem tools) as well as integrated as a CalDAV client or server.Installation------------You need to have the Remind command line tool in version 03.03.01 or higher installed.For Debian/Ubuntu use::  $ sudo apt-get install remindUsing pip~~~~~~~~~::  $ pip install remindThis will install all Python dependencies as well.Using python-setuptools~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~::  $ python3 setup.py installSet up a Remind CalDAV server-----------------------------Have a look at `radicale-remind &lt;https://github.com/jspricke/radicale-remind&gt;`_Sync to an external iCalendar server (http; cron)-------------------------------------------------::  curl URL | ics2rem &gt;&gt; ~/.remindersSync to an external CalDAV server---------------------------------Have a look at `remind-caldav &lt;https://github.com/jspricke/remind-caldav&gt;`_Share your calendar using http------------------------------::  rem2ics &gt; /var/www/html/my.icsPublish the URL and use these guides to integrate it into other calendar software:* `Thunderbird/Lightning &lt;https://mzl.la/1BsOArH&gt;`_ (Section: On the Network)* `Google Calendar &lt;https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37100&gt;`_* `Apple Calendar &lt;https://support.apple.com/kb/PH11523&gt;`_Format of the Remind MSG body-----------------------------::  %&quot;summary at location%&quot; descriptionThe ``%&quot;`` is omitted, if there is no description in the iCalendar.Known limitations-----------------iCalendar -&gt; Remind~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* RECURRENCE-ID is not supported at the moment. This is a limitation of the used python-vobject library, see http://lists.skyhouseconsulting.com/pipermail/vobject/2009-September/000204.html.* Creating new calendars by adding includes to a main Remind file is not supported.Remind -&gt; iCalendar~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Events are only evaluated in the given time frame, so events extending it, are cut of (birthday reminders for example).* Complex reminders are only preserved in their evaluated form (PUSH-OMIT-CONTEXT, OMIT, TRIGGER, BEFORE, SKIP).  Same holds true for function evaluation in MSG. For example having the age in a birthday reminder results in the same string for every year.  This could result in old data being provided as the internal state (cache) is only invalidated if one of the remind files change (last time stamp).* Periodic reminders other then daily or weekly are not preserved.* Two entries with the same content are only exported once.</longdescription>
