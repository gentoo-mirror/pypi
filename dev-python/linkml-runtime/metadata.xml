That model will have dependencies on functionality in this library.The library also provides* loaders: for loading from external formats such as json, yaml, rdf, tsv into LinkML instances* dumpers: the reverse operationSee [working with data](https://linkml.io/linkml/data/index.html) in the documentation for more detailsThis repository also contains the Python dataclass representation of the [LinkML metamodel](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-model), and various utility functions that are useful for working with LinkML data and schemas.It also includes the [SchemaView](https://linkml.io/linkml/developers/manipulating-schemas.html) class for working with LinkML schemas## NotebooksSee the [notebooks](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-runtime/tree/main/notebooks) folder for examples</longdescription>
