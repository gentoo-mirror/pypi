	<longdescription># Django Empty Users AppThis app can be helpful for migrating to custom user model in existing Django project that already has users in database.To learn more, please read this:https://testdriven.io/blog/django-custom-user-model-migration/I've made an app with 1 empty migration file, so you don't have to create it yourself.## Installation```shellpip install django-empty-users-app```## UsageAdd `users` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your `settings.py` file.```pythonINSTALLED_APPS = [    ...    'users',    ...]```Then run migrations:```shellpython manage.py migrate```After performing migrations in all your environments, you can remove this app from `INSTALLED_APPS` and delete it from your project.## License[MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)</longdescription>
