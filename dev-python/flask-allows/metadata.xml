Are your permissionsstomping all over your actual code? Are your permission decorators clawingat your line count all the time? Think there's no answer? There is! Flask-Allows.Flask-Allows is an authorization tool for Flask inspired by`django-rest-framework &lt;https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework&gt;`_'spermissioning system and `rest_condition &lt;https://github.com/caxap/rest_condition&gt;`_'sability to compose simple requirements into more complex ones.Installation------------Flask-Allows is available on `pypi &lt;https://pypi.org/project/flask-allows/&gt;`_ andinstallable with::    pip install flask-allowsFlask Allows supports 2.7, and 3.4+. Support for 3.3 was ended in the version0.3 release... note::    If you are installing ``flask-allows`` outside of a virtual environment,    consider installing it with ``pip install --user flask-allows`` rather    than using sudo or adminstrator privileges to avoid installing it into    your system Python.More Information----------------- For more information, `please visit the documentation &lt;https://flask-allows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_.- Found a bug, have a question, or want to request a feature?
