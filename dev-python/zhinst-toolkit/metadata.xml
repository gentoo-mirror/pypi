It is based on top of the native[Python API](https://pypi.org/project/zhinst-core/) (``zhinst.core``) of LabOneÂ®,the Zurich Instruments control software. It comes in the form of a packagecompatible with Python 3.7+.The central goal of zhinst-toolkit is to provide a pythonic approach to interactwith any Zurich Instruments device and is intended as a full replacement for thelow level ``zhinst.core`` package.## StatusThe zhinst-toolkit is well tested and considered stable enough for general usage.The interfaces may have some incompatible changes between releases.Please check the changelog if you are upgrading.## LabOne softwareAs prerequisite, the LabOne software version 22.02 or later must be installed.It can be downloaded for free at[https://www.zhinst.com/labone](https://www.zhinst.com/labone). Follow theinstallation instructions specific to your platform. Verify that you canconnect to your instrument(s) using the web interface of LabOne. If you areupgrading from an older version, be sure to update the firmware of al yourdevices using the web interface before continuing.In principle LabOne can be installed in a remote machine, but we highlyrecommend to install on the local machine where you intend to run the experiment.## InstallInstall the package with pip:```pip install zhinst-toolkit```## DocumentationFor a full documentation see [here](https://docs.zhinst.com/zhinst-toolkit/en/latest).## ContributingWe welcome contributions by the community, either as bug reports, fixes and newcode.
