	<longdescription># Boto3-Mocking - Centralized Mocking of Boto3 for TestingWhen testing code that accesses AWS through the `boto3` library, it is oftendesirable to isolate the code from actual access to the AWS API.  This libraryfacilitates both that and dispatch of the service requests to mockimplementations.## Install```console$ pip install boto3-mocking```## Usage### Engaging the PatchesTwo options exist to engage the patching of `boto3`: permanent and contextual.  To permanently patch `boto3` within the process, somewhere in the testing code that precedes use of the `boto3.client` and `boto3.resource` functions, use this code:```pythonimport boto3_mockingboto3_mocking.engage_patching()```**NOTE** If your mainline code constructs `boto3` clients or resources when it loads, then it is critical for the test harness to engage patching before loading mainline code.To temporarily patch `boto3`, use this code:```pythonimport boto3_mockingwith boto3_mocking.patching:    ...your code accessing AWS here...```### Testing for Patch EngagementThis package exposes a function to test whether patching is currently engaged.  Use this in your testing code before doing something that would harm or be expensive on the actual AWS environment:```pythonimport boto3_mockingif not boto3_mocking.patching_engaged():    raise Exception(&quot;...&quot;)```### Registering a Service HandlerService handlers can either be registered permanently or contextually.  Registration is managed through `boto3_mocking.clients` and `boto3_mocking.resources`, corresponding to `boto3.client` and `boto3.resource`.  A service handler (whether for a client or a resource) is a callable that accepts arguments by keyword and returns the mock client or resource as appropriate.  The handler should accept the same keywords as the client or service it substitutes.  Registering a mock client *does not* automatically mock a corresponding resource, as the resource does not use `boto3.client` to construct/obtain its client object.To permanently register a client handler for the `'cognito-idp'` service, the code would look like:```pythonimport boto3_mockingboto3_mocking.clients.register_handler('cognito-idp', MockCognitoIdpClient)```Handlers can also be contextually registered:```pythonimport boto3_mockingwith boto3_mocking.resources.handler_for('ec2', MockEC2Resource):    ...your code accessing EC2 here...```Only one handler may be permanently registered for each service, but a contextually registered handler registration does override a permanently registered one for the same service during its context without error or warning.### Accessing Real Boto3 Functionality`boto3_mocking.clients` and `boto3_mocking.resources` both provide a `real` attribute holding the original function from `boto3` from before the patching is engaged.  Your service handlers can make use of these functions if necessary.  One example would be to redirect `'dynamodb'` clients and resources to a DynamoDBLocal instance, where the actual `boto3` library is still needed but needs to have certain keyword arguments (`endpoint_url` and `use_ssl`) included when the client or resource is created.### The Allowed ListsAccess to the real functionality of `boto3` can be allowed service-by-service in both `boto3_mocking.clients` and `boto3_mocking.resources` via their `allowed` set.  Just `add` the name of the service to `boto3_mocking.clients.allowed` or `boto3_mocking.resources.allowed` to allow those calls without a registered handler.### Access to Unhandled ServicesIf a service client or resource is accessed without a handler, `boto3_mocking` raises a `boto3_mocking.UnpatchedAccess` exception unless the service is in the respective `allowed` list.## LicenseThis code is licensed under Apache License 2.0.
