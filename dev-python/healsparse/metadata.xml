	<longdescription># `healsparse`Python implementation of sparse HEALPix maps.`HealSparse` is a sparse implementation of[HEALPix](https://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/) in Python, written for the RubinObservatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time Dark Energy Science Collaboration([DESC](https://lsst-desc.org/)).  `HealSparse` is a pure python library thatsits on top of [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) and[healpy](https://github.com/healpy/healpy/) and is designed to avoid storingfull sky maps in case of partial coverage, including easy reading of sub-maps.This reduces the overall memory footprint allowing maps to be rendered atarcsecond resolution while keeping the familiarity and power of[healpy](https://github.com/healpy/healpy/).`HealSparse` expands on [healpy](https://github.com/healpy/healpy/) andstraight [HEALPix](https://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/) maps by allowing maps ofdifferent data types, including 32- and 64-bit floats; 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-bitintegers; &quot;wide bit masks&quot; of arbitrary width (allowing hundreds of bits to beefficiently and conveniently stored); and[numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) record arrays.  Arithmetic operationsbetween maps are supported, including sum, product, min/max, and and/or/xorbitwise operations for integer maps.  In addition, there is general support forany [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) universal function.`HealSparse` also includes a simple geometric primitive library, to rendercircles and convex polygons.## Requirements:`healsparse` requires to have pre-installed the following packages:- [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)- [healpy](https://github.com/healpy/healpy)- [astropy](https://astropy.org)The following package is optional but recommended for all features:- [fitsio](https://github.com/esheldon/fitsio)## Documentation:Read the full documentation at https://healsparse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.</longdescription>
