	<longdescription>Python Package aeidon for Subtitles===================================[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/aeidon.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/aeidon/)[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/aeidon/month)](https://pepy.tech/project/aeidon)aeidon is a Python package that provides classes and functions fordealing with text-based subtitle files of many different formats.Functions exist for reading and writing subtitle files as well asmanipulating subtitle data, i.e. positions (times or frames) and texts.## InstallationThe latest stable release is available via PyPI.```bashpip install -U aeidon```## Documentationhttps://otsaloma.io/gaupol/doc/api/aeidon.html## Distro-PackagingWhen packaging both aeidon and gaupol in a Linux distro, it's best touse the switches in the main `setup.py` for a consistent whole.    sudo python3 setup.py --without-gaupol install --prefix=/usr/local    sudo python3 setup.py --without-aeidon install --prefix=/usr/localNote that the `--with-*` and `--without-*` are global options and mustbe placed before any commands.Of the dependencies listed in the [`README.md`](README.md) file,iso-codes and chardet are to be associated with aeidon. If aeidon isinstalled using the `--without-iso-codes` switch, then iso-codes isrequired instead of optional. gaupol should depend on the remainingdependencies as well as aeidon of the same version.## HistoryThe aeidon package is part of the Gaupol subtitle editor, where theother package, gaupol, provides the GTK user interface.Separating a user interface independent general-purpose subtitle editingpackage from Gaupol has been an afterthought and thus not well designedto be a reusable component, but on the other hand is proven, working andmaintained code.</longdescription>
