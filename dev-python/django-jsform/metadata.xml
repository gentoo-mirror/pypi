	<longdescription># django_jsformDjango integration for [jsform](https://github.com/quadrant-newmedia/jsform). In a nutshell, this package:- includes jsform scripts as static files- provides a js_response utility module for use with jsform_execresponse- provides form-rendering templates which play nicely with jsform_elementmerge- provides a suite of tests for jsform## The TestsThe tests are all integration tests, and need to be run manually. `python manage.py runserver`, open '/' in your browser, and follow the instructions on the test pages.## Project StatusThis project is the next-generation version of some internal tools we've used on previous production Django sites, but has yet to see significant production usage.## ContactIf you have any comments or questions about the project, please [create an issue on the issue tracker](https://github.com/quadrant-newmedia/django_jsform/issues).</longdescription>
