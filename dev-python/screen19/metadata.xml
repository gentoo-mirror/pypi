This was happening because screen19 was failing to filter out reflections with zero variance in the position of their observed centroids before performing the refinement. (`#53 &lt;https://github.com/xia2/screen19/issues/53&gt;`_)- Fix broken help messages for ``screen19`` and ``screen19.minimum_exposure``. (`#58 &lt;https://github.com/xia2/screen19/issues/58&gt;`_)Deprecations and Removals-------------------------- screen19 no longer supports DIALS 2.2 or Python 2.7.  To install screen19, it is recommended that you start by `installing DIALS &lt;https://dials.github.io/installation.html&gt;`_ version 3.4 or greater.

You can still see them, if you want to, by running screen19 in debug mode with::      screen19 verbosity=1 &lt;other arguments&gt;  (`#30 &lt;https://github.com/xia2/screen19/issues/30&gt;`_)screen19 0.208 (2020-06-25)===========================Features--------- screen19 now supports DIALS 3 and DIALS 2.2.  `DIALS is available here &lt;https://dials.github.io/installation.html&gt;`_.  * DIALS 3 is the latest major release and is actively supported.  It is currently Python 3.6 only.  * DIALS 2.2 is a long-term support release.  It only receives bug fixes and support will be withdrawn at the end of 2020.  It supports Python 2.7 and 3.6.  * DIALS 1.14 is no longer under active development and screen19 support for it has been withdrawn. (`#25 &lt;https://github.com/xia2/screen19/issues/25&gt;`_)Bugfixes--------- Perform French-Wilson scaling on the integrated intensities before performing the Wilson plot analysis.  This fixes screen19 failures for certain cases where the data consist of few reflections. (`#29 &lt;https://github.com/xia2/screen19/issues/29&gt;`_)</longdescription>
