	<longdescription># pitchplotslibrary plotting charts for different tonal representations## Getting StartedThe program consist in the following files: functions.py, reader.py, modified_musicxml_parser.py, parser.py and static.py ### PrerequisitesWhat things you need to install the software and how to install them```You will need python on your computer and the following libaries: matplotlib, pandas and numpy```note that if you are using anaconda, these libraries are already installed### InstallingYou can download the pitchplots package on pypi with pip using the following command in the prompt:```python3 -m pip install pitchplots```or if you're using anaconda prompt```pip install pitchplots```## Running the testsyou can first try to parse xml/musicScore xml files to csv or DataFrame, that is the GymnopÃ©die from Sati with:```pythonimport pitchplots.parser as ppp# If no filepath is specified, will automatically charge data_example.mxldf_data_example = ppp.xml_to_csv(save_csv=True)```then you can try the static module by passing csv files or Dataframe:```import pitchplots.static as ppspps.tonnetz(df_data_example)```or```import pitchplots.static as ppspps.circle('csv/data_example.csv')```to try the dynamic videos:```import pitchplots.dynamic as ppdppd.tonnetz_animation(df_data_example)```## Authors* **Timothy Loayza**, **Fabian Moss**## Use of magenta's codeThe [modified_musicxml_parser.py](modified_musicxml_parser.py) file is taken from the [magenta](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta) project and has been modified. Therefore the modifications are listed in the [magenta_musicxml_code_modifications.md](magenta_musicxml_code_modifications.md) file and there is the [magenta_LICENSE.md](magenta_LICENSE.md).## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details</longdescription>
