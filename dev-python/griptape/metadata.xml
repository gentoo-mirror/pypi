Developers can move between these two dimensions according to their use case.## DocumentationPlease refer to [Griptape Docs](https://docs.griptape.ai/) for:- Getting started guides. - Core concepts and design overviews.- Examples.- Contribution guidelines.## Quick StartFirst, install **griptape** and **griptape-tools**:```pip install griptape griptape-tools -U```Second, configure an OpenAI client by [getting an API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) and adding it to your environment as `OPENAI_API_KEY`. By default, Griptape uses [OpenAI Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion) to execute LLM prompts.With Griptape, you can create *structures*, such as `Agents`, `Pipelines`, and `Workflows`, that are composed of different types of tasks. Let's build a simple creative agent that dynamically uses two tools with shared short-term memory.```pythonfrom griptape.structures import Agentfrom griptape.tools import WebScraperagent = Agent(    tools=[WebScraper()])agent.run(    &quot;based on https://www.griptape.ai/, tell me what Griptape is&quot;)```And here is the output:&gt; Q: based on https://www.griptape.ai/, tell me what Griptape is  &gt; A: Griptape is an opinionated Python framework that enables developers to fully harness the potential of LLMs while enforcing strict trust boundaries, schema validation, and activity-level permissions. It offers developers the ability to build AI systems that operate across two dimensions: predictability and creativity. Griptape can be used to create conversational and autonomous agents.During the run, the Griptape agent loaded a webpage, stored its full content in the short-term memory, and finally queried it to answer the original question. The important thing to note here is that no matter how big the webpage is it can never blow up the prompt token limit because the content never goes to memory instead of the main prompt.## Using Other LLMsBy default, Griptape uses OpenAI's `gpt-4` to drive the core agent logic. Other framework components responsible for summarization, querying, and text extraction use `gpt-3.5-turbo`. All of those are customizable through _prompt drivers_. For example, if you don't have access to `gpt-4`, you can change the quick start snippet like this:```pythonfrom griptape.drivers import OpenAiPromptDriverfrom griptape.structures import Agentfrom griptape.tools import WebScraperagent = Agent(    prompt_driver=OpenAiPromptDriver(        model=&quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;    ),    tools=[WebScraper()])agent.run(    &quot;based on https://www.griptape.ai/, tell me what Griptape is&quot;)```If you are running into `gpt-4` rate limiting issues, specify a custom number of `max_tokens` in the driver:```pythonOpenAiPromptDriver(    max_tokens=200)```[Check out our docs](https://docs.griptape.ai/en/latest/griptape-framework/structures/prompt-drivers/) to learn more about how to use Griptape with other LLM providers like Anthropic, Claude, Hugging Face, and Azure.## VersioningGriptape is in constant development and its APIs and documentation are subject to change. Until we stabilize the API and release version 1.0.0, we will use minor versions (i.e., x.Y.z) to introduce features and breaking features, and patch versions (i.e., x.y.Z) for bug fixes.## ContributingContributions in the form of bug reports, feature ideas, or pull requests are super welcome! Take a look at the current issues and if you'd like to help please submit a pull request with some tests.## LicenseGriptape is available under the Apache 2.0 License.</longdescription>
