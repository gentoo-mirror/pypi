	<longdescription>==============================================================jinja2_s3loader: A Jinja2 template loader for AWS S3.==============================================================**Project Status:** Beta. It's pretty simple and works for me, but not heavilytested in production use. Caveat Emptor.Usage--------------------------------This library relies on the `boto3`_ library for S3 access, so you will need to`configure your AWS credentials`_ first. Then, provide your S3 bucket name andoptional template directory name when instantiating the loader::    #!python    from jinja2 import Environment    from jinja2_s3loader import S3loader    s3template_dir = &quot;test/templates&quot;  # trailing slash not required, but ok    j2 = Environment(loader=S3loader('my-s3-bucket-name', s3template_dir))    t = j2.get_template('mytemplate.j2')  # loads test/templates/mytemplate.j2    print(t.render({})).. _boto3: https://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html.. _configure your AWS credentials: https://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/configuration.htmlNote that, although S3 does not have real directories and treats the prefixstring as purely a sub-string, this S3loader will treat the prefix as asubdirectory. That is, it will add a trailing slash if none is provided.Remember, accessing files over S3 costs money. The loader currently does notsupport live reloading. I built this to support accessing S3 templates from AWSLambda functions, so those constraints are fine with me, but your use case maybe different. Contributions welcome. File a Github issue to report a bug.Known Issues--------------------------------* The loader blindly attempts to decode all templates as UTF-8. If your template  is encoded with an incompatible encoding, it WILL be broken.
