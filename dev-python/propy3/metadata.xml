Afterwards,you simply `import propy`.## IntroductionSequence-derived structural and physicochemical features are highly useful forrepresenting and distinguishing proteins or peptides of different structural,functional and interaction properties, and have been extensively used indeveloping methods and software for predicting protein structural andfunctional classes, protein-protein interactions, drug-target interactions,protein substrates, molecular binding sites on proteins, subcellular locations,protein crystallization propensity and peptides of specific properties. Inorder to conveniently apply these structural features from a protein sequencefor researchers, we developed a propy package using pure python language, whichcould calculate a large number of protein descriptors from a protein sequence.## FeaturesThe propy package has the following significant features:1. It is written by the pure python language. It only needs the support of some   built-in modules in the python software.2. For academic users, it is free of charge. They can freely use and distribute   it. For commercial purpose, they must contact the author.3. It can calculate a large number of protein descriptors including: amino acid   composition descriptors, dipeptide composition descriptors, tri-peptide   composition descriptors, Normalized Moreau-Broto autocorrelation   descriptors, Moran autocorrelation descriptors, Geary autocorrelation   descriptors, Composition, Transition, Distribution descriptors (CTD),   sequence order coupling numbers, quasi-sequence order descriptors, pseudo   amino acid composition descriptors, amphiphilic pseudo amino acid   composition descriptors.4. The users could specify the needed properties of 20 amino acids to calculate   the corresponding protein descriptors.5. The package includes the module which could directly download the protein   sequence form uniprot website by uniprot id.6. The package includes the module which could automatrically download the   property from the AAindex database. Thus, the user could calcualte thousands   of protein features.The protein descriptors calculated by propy1. AAC: amino acid composition descriptors (20)2. DPC: dipeptide composition descriptors (400)3. TPC: tri-peptide composition descriptors (8000)4. MBauto: Normalized Moreau-Broto autocorrelation descriptors (depend on the given properties, the default is 240)5. Moranauto: Moran autocorrelation descriptors(depend on the given properties, the default is 240)6. Gearyauto: Geary autocorrelation descriptors(depend on the given properties, the default is 240)6. CTD: Composition, Transition, Distribution descriptors (CTD) (21+21+105=147)7. SOCN: sequence order coupling numbers (depend on the choice of maxlag, the default is 60)8. QSO: quasi-sequence order descriptors (depend on the choice of maxlag, the default is 100)9. PAAC: pseudo amino acid composition descriptors (depend on the choice of lamda, the default is 50)10. APAAC: amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition descriptors(depend on the choice of lamda, the default is 50)## Install### Pip```bashpip install propy3```### BioConda```bashconda install -c bioconda propy3```## Usage ExampleFor more examples, please see the user guide.```pythonfrom propy import PyProfrom propy.GetProteinFromUniprot import GetProteinSequence# download the protein sequence by uniprot idproteinsequence = GetProteinSequence(&quot;P48039&quot;)DesObject = PyPro.GetProDes(proteinsequence)  # construct a GetProDes objectprint(DesObject.GetCTD())  # calculate 147 CTD descriptorsprint(DesObject.GetAAComp())  # calculate 20 amino acid composition descriptors# calculate 30 pseudo amino acid composition descriptorspaac = DesObject.GetPAAC(lamda=10, weight=0.05)for i in paac:    print(i, paaci)```</longdescription>
