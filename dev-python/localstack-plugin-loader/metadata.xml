Each plugin has a namespace, a unique name in that namespace, and a `PluginFactory` (something that creates `Plugin` the spec is describing.  In the simplest case, that can just be the Plugin's class).* `Plugin`: an object that exposes a `should_load` and `load` method.  Note that it does not function as a domain object (it does not hold the plugins lifecycle state, like initialized, loaded, etc..., or other metadata of the Plugin)* `PluginFinder`: finds plugins, either at build time (by scanning the modules using `pkgutil` and `setuptools`) or at run time (reading entrypoints of the distribution using [stevedore](https://docs.openstack.org/stevedore/latest/))* `PluginManager`: manages the run time lifecycle of a Plugin, which has three states:  * resolved: the entrypoint pointing to the PluginSpec was imported and the `PluginSpec` instance was created  * init: the `PluginFactory` of the `PluginSpec` was successfully invoked  * loaded: the `load` method of the `Plugin` was successfully invoked![architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/localstack/localstack-plugin-loader/main/docs/localstack-plugin-loader-architecture.png)### Loading PluginsAt run time, a `PluginManager` uses a `PluginFinder` that in turn uses stevedore to scan the available entrypoints for things that look like a `PluginSpec`.With `PluginManager.load(name: str)` or `PluginManager.load_all()`, plugins within the namespace that are discoverable in entrypoints can be loaded.If an error occurs at any state of the lifecycle, the `PluginManager` informs the `PluginLifecycleListener` about it, but continues operating.### Discovering entrypointsAt build time (e.g., with `python setup.py develop/install/sdist`), a special `PluginFinder` collects anything that can be interpreted as a `PluginSpec`, and creates from it setuptools entrypoints.In the `setup.py` we can use the `plugin.setuptools.load_entry_points` method to collect a dictionary for the `entry_points` value of `setup()`.```pythonfrom plugin.setuptools import load_entry_pointssetup(    entry_points=load_entry_points(exclude=(&quot;tests&quot;, &quot;tests.*&quot;,)))```Note that `load_entry_points` will try to resolve a cached version of `entry_points.txt` from the `.egg-info` directory,to avoid resolving the entry points when building the package from a source distribution.Examples--------To build something using the plugin framework, you will first want to introduce a Plugin that does something when it is loaded.And then, at runtime, you need a component that uses the `PluginManager` to get those plugins.### One class per pluginThis is the way we went with `LocalstackCliPlugin`. Every plugin class (e.g., `ProCliPlugin`) is essentially a singleton.This is easy, as the classes are discoverable as plugins.Simply create a Plugin class with a name and namespace and it will be discovered by the build time `PluginFinder`.```python# abstract case (not discovered at build time, missing name)class CliPlugin(Plugin):    namespace = &quot;my.plugins.cli&quot;    def load(self, cli):        self.attach(cli)    def attach(self, cli):        raise NotImplementedError# discovered at build time (has a namespace, name, and is a Plugin)class MyCliPlugin(CliPlugin):    name = &quot;my&quot;    def attach(self, cli):        # ... attach commands to cli object```now we need a `PluginManager` (which has a generic type) to load the plugins for us:```pythoncli = # ... needs to come from somewheremanager: PluginManager[CliPlugin] = PluginManager(&quot;my.plugins.cli&quot;, load_args=(cli,))plugins: List[CliPlugin] = manager.load_all()# todo: do stuff with the plugins, if you want/need#  in this example, we simply use the plugin mechanism to run a one-shot function (attach) on a load argument```### Re-usable pluginsWhen you have lots of plugins that are structured in a similar way, we may not want to create a separate Plugin classfor each plugin. Instead we want to use the same `Plugin` class to do the same thing, but use several instances of it.The `PluginFactory`, and the fact that `PluginSpec` instances defined at module level are discoverable (inpiredby [pluggy](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pluggy)), can be used to achieve that.```pythonclass ServicePlugin(Plugin):    def __init__(self, service_name):        self.service_name = service_name        self.service = None    def should_load(self):        return self.service_name in config.SERVICES    def load(self):        module = importlib.import_module(&quot;localstack.services.%s&quot; % self.service_name)        # suppose we define a convention that each service module has a Service class, like moto's `Backend`        self.service = module.Service()def service_plugin_factory(name) -&gt; PluginFactory:    def create():        return ServicePlugin(name)    return create# discoverables3 = PluginSpec(&quot;localstack.plugins.services&quot;, &quot;s3&quot;, service_plugin_factory(&quot;s3&quot;))# discoverabledynamodb = PluginSpec(&quot;localstack.plugins.services&quot;, &quot;dynamodb&quot;, service_plugin_factory(&quot;dynamodb&quot;))# ... could be simplified with convenience framework code, but the principle will stay the same```Then we could use the `PluginManager` to build a Supervisor```pythonclass Supervisor:    manager: PluginManager[ServicePlugin]    def start(self, service_name):        plugin = manager.load(service_name)        service = plugin.service        service.start()```### Functions as pluginswith the `@plugin` decorator, you can expose functions as plugins. They will be wrapped by the frameworkinto `FunctionPlugin` instances, which satisfy both the contract of a Plugin, and that of the function.```pythonfrom plugin import plugin@plugin(namespace=&quot;localstack.configurators&quot;)def configure_logging(runtime):    logging.basicConfig(level=runtime.config.loglevel)@plugin(namespace=&quot;localstack.configurators&quot;)def configure_somethingelse(runtime):    # do other stuff with the runtime object    pass```With a PluginManager via `load_all`, you receive the `FunctionPlugin` instances, that you can call like the functions```pythonruntime = LocalstackRuntime()for configurator in PluginManager(&quot;localstack.configurators&quot;).load_all():    configurator(runtime)```Install-------    pip install localstack-plugin-loaderDevelop-------Create the virtual environment, install dependencies, and run tests    make venv    make testRun the code formatter    make formatUpload the pypi package using twine    make upload</longdescription>
