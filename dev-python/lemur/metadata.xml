While not able to issue certificates itself, Lemur acts as a broker between CAsand environments providing a central portal for developers to issue TLS certificates with 'sane' defaults.Lemur aims to support the 3 most recent python releases which have been released for at least a year. For example, if python3.12 released last month, we'd aim to support versions 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.We deploy on Ubuntu and develop mostly on OS X.Project resources=================- `Lemur Blog Post &lt;http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/09/introducing-lemur.html&gt;`_- `Documentation &lt;http://lemur.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_- `Source code &lt;https://github.com/netflix/lemur&gt;`_- `Issue tracker &lt;https://github.com/netflix/lemur/issues&gt;`_- `Docker &lt;https://github.com/Netflix/lemur-docker&gt;`_</longdescription>
