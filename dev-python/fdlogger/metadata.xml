During the event, we try andmake as many radio contacts with other Hams in a 24 hour period. You can findout more about amateur radio by visiting the [ARRL](https://www.arrl.org/).The logger is written in Python 3, and uses the PyQT5 lib. Qt5 is crossplatform so it might work on everything. I have tested it on Linux, RasperryPi OS and Windows 10. This code is based off of a logger I had done earlierusing Python and the curses library wich can be found[here](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger-Curses) and one written forWinter Field Day [here](https://github.com/mbridak/wfd_py_logger).The log is stored in an sqlite3 database file 'FieldDay.db'. If you need towipe everything and start clean, just delete this file and re-run the loggerThe logger will generate a cabrillo file 'YOURCALL.log' and a 'Statistics.txt'file with a band/mode/power breakdown which you can use when you submit yourlogs to the ARRL online [here](http://field-day.arrl.org/fdentry.php). An ADIFfile will also be generated so you can merge contacts into your normal Log.We now have a group aggregation server, The clients and server pass trafficover Multicast UDP.- [K6GTE Field Day logger (GUI)](#k6gte-field-day-logger-gui)  - [Caveats](#caveats)  - [Recent Changes](#recent-changes)  - [Wheres the data](#wheres-the-data)  - [Installation and running and removal](#installation-and-running-and-removal)  - [What to do first](#what-to-do-first)- [Features](#features)  - [Logging](#logging)  - [Radio Polling with CAT](#radio-polling-with-cat)    - [Without CAT](#without-cat)  - [Cloudlog useage](#cloudlog-useage)  - [QRZ, HamDB or HamQTH](#qrz-hamdb-or-hamqth)  - [XPlanet marker file](#xplanet-marker-file)  - [Editing an existing contact](#editing-an-existing-contact)  - [Super Check Partial](#super-check-partial)  - [Section partial check](#section-partial-check)  - [DUP checking](#dup-checking)  - [Autofill](#autofill)  - [CW Macros](#cw-macros)  - [CW Macros (Run vs S\&amp;P)](#cw-macros-run-vs-sp)  - [CWDAEMON speed changes](#cwdaemon-speed-changes)  - [When the event is over](#when-the-event-is-over)  - [Group / Club logging](#group--club-logging)    - [Server configuration](#server-configuration)    - [Client configuration for groups](#client-configuration-for-groups)    - [Chat Window](#chat-window)    - [How to know the server is there](#how-to-know-the-server-is-there)    - [Logging reliability](#logging-reliability)    - [Generating the cabrillo file](#generating-the-cabrillo-file)    - [I'm sure there are short cummings](#im-sure-there-are-short-cummings)![Picture of main screen](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/loggerscreenshot.png)![Picture of server main screen](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/server_pic.png)## CaveatsThis has always been a &quot;scratch my own itch&quot; project. And the development ofit is driven by that. However, I welcome suggestions, criticisms and featurerequests.Field Day only has a generic digital mode designator 'DG', which gets exportedto the cabrillo file. But ADIF and CloudLog needed something else, So I ChoseFT8. Yes Yes, I know. FT8 is the spawn of Satan, and is killing Ham Radio...Blah Blah Blah... Feel free to change it to what ever you will use.Just search for the two places in the code 'FT8' is used and Bob's your dadsbrother.**WB8ERJ's blog writeup** [Mike's Tech Blog WB8ERJ](https://mikestechblog.com/field-day-logging-software-for-the-raspberry-pi/)## Recent Changes- [23.6.25] Fixed missing Canadian sections.- [23.6.24] Fix 6M CW default frequency.

If youneed to wipe everything and start clean, just delete this file and re-run thelogger.The aggrigation server stores it's database in a file called, in a stroke ofinspiration, './server_database.db'.The logger will generate a cabrillo file './YOURCALL.log' and a'./Statistics.txt' file with a band/mode/power breakdown which you can usewhen you submit your logs to the ARRL online[here](http://field-day.arrl.org/fdentry.php).The server will generate a cabrillo file './YOURCLUBSCALLSIGN.log'An ADIF file './FieldDay.adi' will also be generated by the client so you canmerge contacts into your normal Log.The server does not create an adif file, 'cause why should it...## Installation and running and removal```bash# installpip install fdlogger# updatepip install -U fdlogger# removepip uninstall fdlogger# run itfdlogger```If you get a message about `./local/bin` not being in your PATH, try logging out and right back in. Most of the time your linux distro will detect you now have files in there and add it to your PATH.## What to do firstWhen run for the first time, you will be greeted by a dialog asking for yourCallsign, Class and Section. Afterward, there is a gear icon on the mainscreen, where you can change your CAT, CW interface, callsign lookup serviceetc. You can also change your call class and section by clicking on therespective fields.![Picture showing bottom of screen](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/yourstuff.png)![Picture showing settings screen](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/loggerSettingsDialog.png)# Features## LoggingOkay you've made a contact. Enter the call in the call field. As you type itin, it will do a super check partial (see below). Press TAB or SPACE toadvance to the next field. Once the call is entered and you've moved to thenext field, it will do a DUP check (see below). It will try and Autofill thenext fields (see below). When entering the section, it will do a sectionpartial check (see below). Press the ENTER key to submit the contact to thelog.If it's a busted call or a dup, press the ESC key to clear all inputs andstart again.## Radio Polling with CATIf you run flrig or rigctld on a computer connected to the radio, it can bepolled for band/mode updates automatically. Click the gear icon at the bottomof the screen to set the IP and port and choose flrig or rigctld. The defaultports are 4532 for rigctld and 12345 for flrig.  There is a radio icon at thebottom of the logging window to indicate polling status. Green good, Red bad.### Without CATIf your radio does not provide CAT control, The frequency can be specified byentering the frequency in the callsign field in kilohertz, then pressing thespacebar. So a 20M CW contact might be entered as 14032.5If you do not enter a frequency, a sane value is chosen for you. This is fine.Since a specific frequency is not required for Field Day.## Cloudlog useageIf you use [CloudLog](https://github.com/magicbug/Cloudlog) for your mainlogging you can click the gear icon to enter your credentials. Contacts arepushed to CloudLog as soon as they are logged.## QRZ, HamDB or HamQTHThe QRZ/HamDB/HamQTH lookup is only used to get the name and gridsquare forthe call. Mainly because when a contact is pushed to[CloudLog](https://github.com/magicbug/Cloudlog) it will not show as a pin onthe map unless it has a gridsquare. So this is a scratch my own itch feature.The call to the lookup service is made anytime you exit the call entry fieldby pressing a TAB or Space key. This call is done in it's own thread so it willnot slow down the GUI interface.Distance and bearing to contact is also calculated at this time, though Ihaven't made use of the data.## XPlanet marker fileIf you use QRZ/HamdDB lookups you can also generate an[XPlanet](http://xplanet.sourceforge.net/) markerfile which will show littlepips on the map as contacts are logged.![Picture showing xplanet](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/xplanet.png)The above launched with an example command:```bashxplanet -body earth -window -longitude -117 -latitude 38 -config Default -projection azmithal -radius 200 -wait 5```## Editing an existing contactDouble click a contact in the upper portion of the screen to edit or delete it.![Picture showing edit qso dialog](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/editqso.png)## Super Check PartialIf you type more than two characters in the callsign field the program willfilter the input through a &quot;Super Check Partial&quot; routine and show you possiblematches to known contesting call signs. Is this useful? Doubt it.![Picture showing super check partial](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/scp.png)## Section partial checkAs you type the section abbreviation you are presented with a list of allpossible sections that start with what you have typed.![Picture showing section check partial](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/sectioncheck.png)## DUP checkingOnce you type a complete callsign and press TAB or SPACE to advance to the nextfield. The callsign is checked against previous callsigns in your log. It willlist any prior contact made showing the band and mode of the contact. If theband and mode are the same as the one you are currently using, the listing willbe highlighted, the screen will flash, a bell will sound to alert you that thisis a DUP. At this point you and the other OP can argue back and forth aboutwho's wrong. In the end you'll put your big boy pants on and make a decision ifyou'll enter the call or not.![Picture showing dup checking](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/dupe.png)If you are using the group server, the client will poll the server as well asking if this is a dupe.## AutofillIf you have worked this person before on another band/mode the program willload the class and section used previously for this call so you will not haveto enter this info again.## CW MacrosThe program will check in the current working directory for a file called`cwmacros_fd.txt`. If not present it will be created. It will parse the fileand configure the row of 12 buttons along the bottom half of the window.The macros can be activated by either pressing the corresponding function key,or by directly clicking on the button. You can check the file to glean it'sstructure, but it's pretty straight forward. Each line has 4 sections separatedby the pipe `|` character.Here's an example line.`R|F2|Run Exch|{HISCALL} {MYCLASS} {MYSECT}`The first field is an `R` if the macro is to be shown while in Run mode.Otherwise an `S` for Search and Pounce. The second field is the function keyto program. The third is the text label to put in the button. Lastly thefourth is the text you would like to send.A limited set of substitution macros are offered.`{MYCALL}``{HISCALL}``{MYCLASS}``{MYSECT}`These are pulled straight from the onscreen input fields. Combined with normaltext this should have you covered for most of your exchange needs.## CW Macros (Run vs S&amp;P)You can toggle the macros in use between Run and Search and Pounce by clickingthe button to the left of the settings/gear button at the botton right portionof the screen.![Picture showing buttons](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/run_sp.png)This can also be used to reload the macros if you edit them while the programis running.## CWDAEMON speed changesIf you use cwdaemon for your cw macro sending, you can press the PageUp andPageDown keys on your keyboard to increase/decrease the cw sending speed.You can press `ESC` to abort CW output.## When the event is overAfter the big weekend, once you've swept up all the broken beer bottles andwiped the BBQ sauce off your chin, go ahead and click the Generate Logs button.![Picture showing generate log button](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/genlog.png)This will generate the following:An ADIF log 'FieldDay.adi'.A Cabrillo log 'Yourcall.log'. Which you edit to fill in your address etc.If your not using Windows, you must ensure whatever editor you use uses CR/LFline endings. Cause whatever they use at the ARRL will choke with out them.To be safe you might want to run it through 'unix2dos' before submitting it.A 'Statistics.txt' file which breaks down your band/mode/power usage.## Group / Club loggingI have added a group contact aggrigating server. This can be run on the samecomputer as the client program, or on a separate dedicated PC or Raspberry Pion the same network.![Picture showing main server screen](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/server_pic.png)### Server configurationThe configuration file for the server is a JSON file 'server_preferences.json'.```json{    &quot;ourcall&quot;: &quot;W1AW&quot;,    &quot;ourclass&quot;: &quot;3A&quot;,    &quot;oursection&quot;: &quot;ORG&quot;,    &quot;bonus&quot;: {        &quot;emergency_power&quot;: {            &quot;bool&quot;: 0,            &quot;station_count&quot;: 0        },        &quot;media_publicity&quot;: 0,        &quot;public_location&quot;: 0,        &quot;public_info_table&quot;: 0,        &quot;message_to_section_manager&quot;: 0,        &quot;message_handling&quot;: {            &quot;bool&quot;: 0,            &quot;message_count&quot;: 0        },        &quot;satellite_qso&quot;: 0,        &quot;w1aw_bulletin&quot;: 0,        &quot;educational_activity&quot;: 0,        &quot;elected_official_visit&quot;: 0,        &quot;agency_representative_visit&quot;: 0,        &quot;gota&quot;: 0,        &quot;web_submission&quot;: 0,        &quot;youth_participation&quot;: {            &quot;bool&quot;: 0,            &quot;youth_count&quot;: 0        },        &quot;social_media&quot;: 0,        &quot;safety_officer&quot;: 0    },    &quot;batterypower&quot;: 1,    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Hiram Maxim&quot;,    &quot;address&quot;: &quot;225 Main Street&quot;,    &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Newington&quot;,    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;CT&quot;,    &quot;postalcode&quot;: &quot;06111&quot;,    &quot;country&quot;: &quot;USA&quot;,    &quot;email&quot;: &quot;Hiram.Maxim@arrl.net&quot;,    &quot;mullticast_group&quot;: &quot;239.1.1.1&quot;,    &quot;multicast_port&quot;: 2239,    &quot;interface_ip&quot;: &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;,}```Go ahead and edit this file before running the server. Feel free to leave thelast 3 items as they are unless you have good reason not too. The rest shouldbe straight forward.Under the bonuses section, if your group qualifies for a bonus, replace the '0'next to the bonus with a '1'. Three of the bonuses require a count of itemsqualifiying you for the bonus. For example Message Handling. If your groupqualifies for this, change the value of 'bool' to a 1, and then 'message_count'to the number of messages handled.### Client configuration for groupsIn the settings dialog there is now a tab labeled 'Group Operation'.![Picture showing settings dialog tab](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/group_server_settings.png)Go ahead and place a check next to 'Connect to server'. Rejoyce and letmerriment be had by all. Be sure and have your callsign already set beforechecking this. If you forgot, Uncheck it, set your callsign and then check it.A couple of things will change on the client when this is done. You will seethat your callsign will disappear and be replaced with your clubs call that theserver reports. The portion of the screen where all the different ARRL sectionsare displayed will be replaced by a group chat window and a column showing thestation call, band and mode of other participants.![Picture showing logger screen changes](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/group_chat.png)If more than one operator is on the same band/mode, their names will behighlighted in the operators list. Feel free to yell at eachother in the chat.![Picture showing band and mode conflict](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/band_conflict.png)### Chat WindowThe chat window is pretty straight forward. If someone mentions you in the chatthat line will be highlighted with an accent color. If you find the font sizedoes not work for you, can adjust the size by: Placing your mouse cursor in thechat window, then rotate your mouse wheel while holding down the Control key.There is one command you can type into the chat window that may be of use.if you type `@stats` into the window, the server will dump out some stats into thechat.```textServer: Band   CW    PH    DI 160     0     0     0  80     0     0    25  40     0   159     0  20     1   162   126  15     0     0     0  10     0     0     0   6     0    17     0   2     0     0     0Score: 1284Last Hour: 271Last 15: 81```Since most people will not be able to see the screen of the server, if it hasone at all. You may find this useful.### How to know the server is thereMost likely, the server will be in some other tent/building/area of the room.Every 10 seconds or so the server will send out a UDP network packet sayingit's there. As long as your client keeps seeing these packets the group callindicator at the bottom of the screen will look like:![Picture showing server status](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/server_pinging.png)But if about 30 seconds go by with no update from the server, the indicatorwill change to:![Picture showing server status](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/server_not_pinging.png)Go check on it.### Logging reliabilityAs mentioned before, We're using UDP traffic to pass data back and forth to theserver. UDP traffic is a 'Fire and forget' method. Akin to a bunch of peoplein the same room yelling at eachother. Everyone can hear you, but you don'tknow if anyone heard what you said. This has both Advantages and Disadvantages.One advantage is that your program is not stuck waiting for a reply or timeoutlocking up your user interface. The disadvantage is you have no idea if anyonetook note of what you had said.This works fine in a local network since the traffic doesn't have to survivethe trip through the big bad tubes of the internet. That being said, someonemay trip on a cord, unplugging the router/switch/wireless gateway. Or someonemay be trying to use WIFI and they are Soooooo far away you can barely seetheir tent. Or worse you have EVERYONE on WIFI, and there are packet collisionsgalore degrading your network.To account for this, the client logging program keeps track of recent packetssent, noting the time they were sent at. The server after getting a packet,generates a response to the sender with it's unique identifyer. Once the clientgets the response from the server, it will remove the request on the local sideand print a little message at the bottom of the screen giving you a visualconfirmation that the command was acted upon by the server.If the server does not respond either because the response was lost or therequest never made it to reply too. The client will resend thepacket every 30 seconds until it gets a reply.But all this may still result in the server not having a copy of your contact.To account for this, when the &quot;Generate Logs&quot; button is pressed on the client,the client will resend all the logged contacts that have not gotten responsesfrom the server. You can keep doing this, if need be,  until it gets them all.Chat traffic is best effort. Either everyone sees your plea for more beer orthey don't. No retry is made for chat traffic. Just get your butt up and makethe trip to the cooler.### Generating the cabrillo fileIf any of the networked clients presses the 'Generate Logs' button on theirscreen, the server will be told to generate it's cabrillo file, it will benamed 'WhatEverYourClubCallIs.log'### I'm sure there are short cummingsIt's early days, and I've mainly tested the operations with the client loggingprogram and several simulated operators, see file in `testing/simulant.py`Real world use for Field Day in September is hard to come by. So I'm sure thereare a couple of things I forgot, or didn't account for.If you are part of a group of linux using Hams, please take this for a spin andtell me what I missed or could do better.</longdescription>
