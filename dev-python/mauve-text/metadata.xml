	<longdescription># MAUVEMAUVE is a library built on PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers to measure the gap between neural text and human text with the eponymous MAUVE measure, introduced [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01454.pdf) (NeurIPS 2021 Ooutstanding Paper).### [Documentation Link](krishnap25.github.io/mauve/)### _New: MAUVE is available via [HuggingFace Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/how_to_metrics.html)!_**Features**:- MAUVE with quantization using *k*-means. - Adaptive selection of *k*-means hyperparameters. - Compute MAUVE using pre-computed GPT-2 features (i.e., terminal hidden state),     or featurize raw text using HuggingFace transformers + PyTorch.- New: minibatching for efficient implementation. ## InstallationFor a direct install, run this command from your terminal:```pip install mauve-text```     ## CitationIf you find this package useful, or you use it in your research, please cite:```@inproceedings{pillutla-etal:mauve:neurips2021,  title={MAUVE: Measuring the Gap Between Neural Text and Human Text using Divergence Frontiers},  author={Pillutla, Krishna and Swayamdipta, Swabha and Zellers, Rowan and Thickstun, John and Welleck, Sean and Choi, Yejin and Harchaoui, Zaid},  booktitle = {NeurIPS},  year      = {2021}}```Further, the Frontier Integral was introduced in this paper:```@inproceedings{liu-etal:divergence:neurips2021,  title={{Divergence Frontiers for Generative Models: Sample Complexity, Quantization Effects, and Frontier Integrals}},  author={Liu, Lang and Pillutla, Krishna and  Welleck, Sean and Oh, Sewoong and Choi, Yejin and Harchaoui, Zaid},  booktitle = {NeurIPS},  year      = {2021}}```    ## AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by NSF DMS-2134012, NSF CCF-2019844, NSF DMS-2023166, the DARPA MCS program through NIWC Pacific (N66001-19-2-4031), the CIFAR &quot;Learning in Machines &amp; Brains&quot; program, a Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship, and faculty research awards.</longdescription>
