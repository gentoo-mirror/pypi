To do so, shift+right click in Jupyter, then click Inspect element. You may need to enable your browser's develop mode in its preferences for this option to appear when you right-click.### Check your Python environmentCheck that you have activated the correct conda or other virtual environment as you expect.When sharing errors, it can be helpful to share the current versions of packages in the environment, e.g., by `conda list` or `pip list`.### Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs, then refresh the browser tabTo ensure that older widget JavaScript output is not causing conflicts with newer JavaScript output (which may persist via notebook outputs even without running notebook cells), clear old outputs by Kernel -&gt; Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs. Then refresh the browser tab (containing Jupyter) to ensure all JavaScript outputs are fresh.### Check the widget configurationIf the widget renders successfully, you can get its current configuration by```pyvw = vc.widget()vw``````pyvw.config```### Usage when Jupyter is running on a remote machineIf Jupyter is running on a remote machine, then use `proxy=True`. You may need to specify `host_name` as well (`widget` should be able to detect this but the plain `display` cannot).```pyvw = vc.widget(proxy=True)vw```or ```pyvc.display(proxy=True, host_name=&quot;http://localhost:8888&quot;)```### Ensure that Vitessce and Jupyter are installed in the same environmentWith the environment activated, run `pip list` on the command line:```Package                       Version----------------------------- -----------...jupyterlab                    3.x.x...vitessce                      3.x.x```## Resources- [ipywidget docs: Building a Custom Widget](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20Custom.html)- [ipywidget docs: Low Level Widget Tutorial](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20Low%20Level.html)- [ipywidget example: ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet)- [ipywidget example (with React): ipymaterialui](https://github.com/maartenbreddels/ipymaterialui)- [ipywidget example (with React): higlass-python](https://github.com/higlass/higlass-python)- [ipywidget cookiecutter](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/widget-cookiecutter)- [Sphinx: Getting Started](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html)- [Read the Docs Sphinx Theme](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme)- [jupyter server proxy](https://jupyter-server-proxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arbitrary-ports-hosts.html)## Getting/Offering HelpIf you have a specific bug or feature request, please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/vitessce/vitessce-python/issues/new).  Otherwise our [discussions](https://github.com/vitessce/vitessce-python/discussions) section is a great place to get help or offer it.  If you aren't sure if something is a bug or not, don't have all the reproduction steps, or just have a general question, feel free to open a discussion post.</longdescription>
