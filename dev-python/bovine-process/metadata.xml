	<longdescription># bovine_process`bovine_process` consists of the side effect logic of Activity objects. This means it contains the code, the logic that for an incoming object, one executes:- Store object in bovine_store- Add reference to inbox- Perform side effects- Enque object for bovine_pubsubAnd a similar list of effects for outgoing objects, i.e- Store object in bovine_store- Add reference to outbox- Perform side effects- Send objects to follower's inbox- Enque object for bovine_pubsubThe behavior defined in this package corresponds to [6. Client to Server Interactions](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#client-to-server-interactions) and [7. Server to Server Interactions](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#server-to-server-interactions) of the ActivityPub specification. However, only a small subset of side effects is implemented.## Implemented Side Effects- Create, Update, Delete on objects, i.e. basic crud- Like, Dislike, EmojiReact -&gt; add to likes collection; Undo removes- Announce -&gt; add to share collection; Undo removes- The same person can Like, Announce, etc.. multiple times- Create with inReplyTo -&gt; add to replies collection; Delete removes- Follow and Accept  - Outgoing Accept of Follow adds to followers  - Incoming Accept of Follows adds to following- [ ] Specify Update checks- [ ] Authority checks.- [ ] Refactor for easier customization / extension. Adding a new side effect currently requires publishing a new package. This should not be the case.## TestsThe folder `tests/data` contains test cases what side effects happen in the database for certain cases.</longdescription>
