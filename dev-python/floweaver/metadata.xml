We aim to provide a **common data format and data converters** to support interoperability and open data.You are free to copy, modify, and distribute floWeaver with attributionunder the terms of the MIT license. See the `LICENSE &lt;LICENSE&gt;`_ filefor details. If you find it useful please acknowledge that by citing floWeaver (`see below &lt;#citing-floweaver&gt;`_).Get started using floWeaver---------------------------floWeaver is a Python package, but you can successfully use it as a data analysistool even without too much familiarity with Python. The best way to get started isto use it in a `Jupyter notebook &lt;http://jupyter.org/&gt;`_ (more advanced users canuse it outside the notebook environment to export JSON/SVG but this is stillunder development; see `this comment&lt;https://github.com/ricklupton/floweaver/issues/34#issuecomment-385040059&gt;`_).üöÄ **Try floWeaver online with no installation:** `Quickstart tutorial on Binder&lt;https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ricklupton/floweaver/master?filepath=docs%2Ftutorials%2Fquickstart.ipynb&gt;`_.To install floWeaver locally, you need Python 3 installed (you might want to install it using `Anaconda or Miniconda &lt;https://www.continuum.io/downloads&gt;`_); see the `installation page&lt;https://floweaver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html&gt;`_ for full details.Installation using conda________________________You can install floweaver using conda:.. code-block:: console   conda install -c conda-forge floweaverYou likely also want `ipysankeywidget &lt;https://github.com/ricklupton/ipysankeywidget&gt;`_ to show Sankeydiagrams in the Jupyter notebook. Install it using conda:.. code-block:: console   conda install -c conda-forge ipysankeywidget   (that's it ‚Äî the jupyter nbextensions are enabled automatically when using conda)   Installation using pip______________________Alternatively, you can install floweaver using pip:.. code-block:: console   pip install floweaverYou likely also want `ipysankeywidget &lt;https://github.com/ricklupton/ipysankeywidget&gt;`_ to show Sankeydiagrams in the Jupyter notebook. Install this using pip and enable:.. code-block:: console   pip install ipysankeywidget   jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix ipysankeywidget   ipywidgets also needs to be enabled. You might have already done this, but missing it out is acommon cause of problems so it doesn't hurt to do it again!.. code-block:: console   jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextensionQuickstart tutorial___________________To get started, open the `quickstart tutorial &lt;docs/tutorials/quickstart.ipynb&gt;`_ inJupyter notebook and step through the notebook cells to produce the fruit example shown above.Find out more üìñ________________`Tutorials, cookbook examples, and API documentation are all available on ReadTheDocs&lt;https://floweaver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_If you have a question that isn't answered please `open an issue on GitHub&lt;https://github.com/ricklupton/floweaver/issues&gt;`_, if there isn't one there already. You canalso use the `Gitter chatroom &lt;https://gitter.im/floweaver/Lobby&gt;`_ for discussion and questions.Contributing üéÅ---------------Thanks for your interest in contributing! There are many ways to contribute to floWeaver: sharing examples of work done using it, suggestions for improving the documentation, examplesof things that are more difficult than they should be or don't work, as well as actual fixes tocode and documentation. To get started see `CONTRIBUTING.md &lt;CONTRIBUTING.md&gt;`_ and our `code ofconduct &lt;CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md&gt;`_.We have a `detailed Roadmap &lt;https://github.com/ricklupton/floweaver/projects/2&gt;`_ showing what weare working on up to May 2018; beyond that there is the `longer-term Roadmap &lt;https://github.com/ricklupton/floweaver/projects/1&gt;`_. We also have `good first issues grouped by type of contribution &lt;https://github.com/ricklupton/floweaver/projects/3&gt;`_.How does it work?-----------------floWeaver builds on the approach described in the paper `Hybrid Sankey diagrams:Visual analysis of multidimensional data for understanding resource use&lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.05.002&gt;`_. It uses `ipysankeywidget &lt;https://github.com/ricklupton/ipysankeywidget&gt;`_ and `d3-sankey-diagram &lt;https://github.com/ricklupton/d3-sankey-diagram&gt;`_ for actually drawing the Sankeydiagrams... image:: docs/project_components.pngCiting floWeaver----------------If floweaver has been significant in a project that leads to a publication, pleaseacknowledge that by citing the paper linked above:   R.
