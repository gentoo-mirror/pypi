	<longdescription>pineapple-module----------------This project is a Python module that defines some utilityfunctions for the Pineapple IPython/Jupyter front-end.The goal is to standardize notebooks so that notebook authorscan have a consistent and easy way for readers to reproduce theirexact results with the least amount of hassle.Usage~~~~~After importing the module, within IPython notebooks you getmagic functions ``%pip``, ``%require``, and ``%runtest``.The ``%pip`` command lets you easily use the ``pip`` commanddirectly to manage installed packages.The ``%require`` command shows all installed packages with versionsif called with no arguments. If called with arguments, it will attemptto install the requested packages. Arguments are version specifiers,separated by spaces.The ``%runtest`` command takes any number of test case or test suiteclasses descended from ``unittest.TestCase`` or ``unittest.TestSuite``and runs them in the cell. It should also be compatible with ``unittest2``.::    import pineapple        %pip install numpy        %pip list        %require numpy==1.9.2        %require numpy==1.9.2 ipython==4.0.0        %require    %runtest MyTesterClass</longdescription>
