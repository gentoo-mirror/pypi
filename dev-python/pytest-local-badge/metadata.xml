However, hosting them can get bit troublesome when working on private projects.This pytest plugin sidesteps the problem by generating local badge files that you can simply add to the project repository and reference in the `README.md` directly.Having a bit of extra noise in your change history is worthy cost of having pretty badges, right?# Installation    pip install pytest-local-badge# UsageThe only thing you have to tell the plugin is where to store badges:        pytest --local-badge-output-dir badges/All supported badges will be stored that directory.  You can find the complete list of supported options by calling `pytest -h` and looking for all configuration parameters starting with ` --local-badge-*`.Here are the options available at the moment:    --no-local-badge      Disable the local badge plugin.    --local-badge-output-dir=LOCAL_BADGE_OUTPUT_DIR                            The directory to save local badges to.    --local-badge-generate={cov,status} [{cov,status} ...]                            List of local badges to generate.    --local-badge-status-file-name=LOCAL_BADGE_STATUS_FILE_NAME                            Desired output file name    --local-badge-cov-file-name=LOCAL_BADGE_COV_FILE_NAME                            Desired output file name# Supported badges:1. `status` -- Number of tests (total &amp; passed)2. `cov` -- Coverage report as per `pytest-cov` plugin (the `pytest-cov` must be installed separately.)</longdescription>
