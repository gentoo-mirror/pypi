The nbconvert tool allows you to convert an`.ipynb` notebook file into various static formats including:- HTML- LaTeX- PDF- Reveal JS- Markdown (md)- ReStructured Text (rst)- executable script## UsageFrom the command line, use nbconvert to convert a Jupyter notebook (_input_) to aa different format (_output_). The basic command structure is:```$ jupyter nbconvert --to &lt;output format&gt; &lt;input notebook&gt;```where `&lt;output format&gt;` is the desired output format and `&lt;input notebook&gt;` is thefilename of the Jupyter notebook.### Example: Convert a notebook to HTMLConvert Jupyter notebook file, `mynotebook.ipynb`, to HTML using:```$ jupyter nbconvert --to html mynotebook.ipynb```This command creates an HTML output file named `mynotebook.html`.## Dev InstallCheck if pandoc is installed (`pandoc --version`); if needed, install:```sudo apt-get install pandoc```Or```brew install pandoc```Install nbconvert for development using:```git clone https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert.gitcd nbconvertpip install -e .```Running the tests after a dev install above:```pip install nbconvert[test]py.test --pyargs nbconvert```## Documentation- [Documentation for Jupyter nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  \[[PDF](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/nbconvert/latest/nbconvert.pdf)\]- [nbconvert examples on GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert-examples)- [Documentation for Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)  \[[PDF](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/jupyter/latest/jupyter.pdf)\]## Technical Support- [Issues and Bug Reports](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/issues): A place to report  bugs or regressions found for nbconvert- [Community Technical Support and Discussion - Discourse](https://discourse.jupyter.org/): A place for  installation, configuration, and troubleshooting assistannce by the Jupyter community.  As a non-profit project and maintainers who are primarily volunteers, we encourage you  to ask questions and share your knowledge on Discourse.## Jupyter Resources- [Jupyter mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter)- [Project Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org)## About the Jupyter Development TeamThe Jupyter Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Jupyter project.This includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:https://github.com/jupyter/.## Our Copyright PolicyJupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyrightover their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that thesecontributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupytersource code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person orinstitution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire JupyterDevelopment Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain a record of whatchanges/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicatetheir copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit thechange to one of the Jupyter repositories.With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code fileto indicate the copyright and license terms:```# Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team.# Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.```[jinja]: http://jinja.pocoo.org/</longdescription>
