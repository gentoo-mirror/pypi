	<longdescription># aws-sso-util## Making life with Identity Center a little easier[AWS IAM Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/) (formerly AWS SSO) has some rough edges, and `aws-sso-util` is here to smooth them out, hopefully temporarily until AWS makes it better.`aws-sso-util` contains utilities for the following:* Configuring `.aws/config`* Logging in/out* AWS SDK support* Looking up identifiers* CloudFormationThe underlying Python library for Identity Center authentication is [`aws-sso-lib`](https://pypi.org/project/aws-sso-lib/), which has useful functions like interactive login, creating a boto3 session for specific a account and role, and the programmatic versions of the `lookup` functions in `aws-sso-util`.`aws-sso-util` supersedes `aws-sso-credential-process`, which is still available in its original form [here](https://github.com/benkehoe/aws-sso-credential-process).Read the updated docs for `aws-sso-util credential-process` [here](docs/credential-process.md).## Quickstart1. I recommend you install [`pipx`](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/), which installs the tool in an isolated virtualenv while linking the script you need.Mac [and Linux](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux):```bashbrew install pipxpipx ensurepath```Other:```bashpython3 -m pip install --user pipxpython3 -m pipx ensurepath```2. Install```bashpipx install aws-sso-util```3. Learn```bashaws-sso-util --help```## DocumentationSee the full docs at [https://github.com/benkehoe/aws-sso-util](https://github.com/benkehoe/aws-sso-util)</longdescription>
