The toolkit has functions for every part of the scientific process; discovery, IO, quality control, corrections, retrievals, visualization, and analysis.   It is a community platform for sharing code with the goal of reducing duplication of effort and better connecting the science community with programs such as the `Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) User Facility &lt;http://www.arm.gov&gt;`_.  Overarching development goals will be updated on a regular basis as part of the `Roadmap &lt;https://github.com/AdamTheisen/ACT/blob/master/guides/ACT_Roadmap_2.pdf&gt;`_  .|act|.. |act| image:: ./docs/source/act_plots.pngPlease report any issues or feature requests by sumitting an `Issue &lt;https://github.com/ARM-DOE/ACT/issues&gt;`_.  Additionally, our `discussions boards &lt;https://github.com/ARM-DOE/ACT/discussions&gt;`_ are open for ideas, general discussions or questions, and show and tell!Announcements~~~~~~~~~~~~~Following GitHub standards for a more open community and inclusiveness, ACT main branch will be renamed from master to main.https://github.com/github/renaminghttps://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-rename-master-to-mainFor those using ACT with anaconda and pip, there will be no changes . If you are using a fork of ACT with GitHub under branch settings on GitHub you can rename the branch to main.commands to switch naming locally can be found here:https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-rename-master-to-mainImportant Links~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Documentation: https://arm-doe.github.io/ACT/* Examples: https://arm-doe.github.io/ACT/source/auto_examples/index.html* Issue Tracker: https://github.com/ARM-DOE/ACT/issuesCiting~~~~~~If you use ACT to prepare a publication, please cite the DOI listed in the badge above, which is updated with every version release to ensure that contributors get appropriate credit.

One way is to install using pip.When installing with pip, the ACT dependencies found in`requirements.txt &lt;https://github.com/ARM-DOE/ACT/blob/master/requirements.txt&gt;`_ will also be installed. To install using pip::    pip install act-atmosThe easiest method for installing ACT is to use the conda packages fromthe latest release. To do this you must download and install`Anaconda &lt;https://www.anaconda.com/download/#&gt;`_ or`Miniconda &lt;https://conda.io/miniconda.html&gt;`_.With Anaconda or Miniconda install, it is recommended to create a new condaenvironment when using ACT or even other packages. To create a newenvironment based on the `environment.yml &lt;https://github.com/ARM-DOE/ACT/blob/master/environment.yml&gt;`_::    conda env create -f environment.ymlOr for a basic environment and downloading optional dependencies as needed::    conda create -n act_env -c conda-forge python=3.7 act-atmosBasic command in a terminal or command prompt to install the latest version ofACT::    conda install -c conda-forge act-atmosTo update an older version of ACT to the latest release use::    conda update -c conda-forge act-atmosIf you do not wish to use Anaconda or Miniconda as a Python environment or wantto use the latest, unreleased version of ACT see the section below on**Installing from source**.Installing from Source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Installing ACT from source is the only way to get the latest updates andenhancement to the software that have no yet made it into a release.The latest source code for ACT can be obtained from the GitHub repository,https://github.com/ARM-DOE/ACT. Either download and unpack the`zip file &lt;https://github.com/ARM-DOE/ACT/archive/master.zip&gt;`_ ofthe source code or use git to checkout the repository::    git clone https://github.com/ARM-DOE/ACT.gitTo install in your home directory, use::    python setup.py install --userTo install for all users on Unix/Linux::    python setup.py build    sudo python setup.py installContributing~~~~~~~~~~~~ACT is an open source, community software project. Contributions to thepackage are welcomed from all users.The latest source code can be obtained with the command::    git clone https://github.com/ARM-DOE/ACT.gitIf you are planning on making changes that you would like included in ACT,forking the repository is highly recommended.We welcome contributions for all uses of ACT, provided the code can bedistributed under the BSD 3-clause license. A copy of this license isavailable in the **LICENSE.txt** file in this directory. For more oncontributing, see the `contributor's guide. &lt;https://github.com/ARM-DOE/ACT/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst&gt;`_Testing~~~~~~~For testing, we use pytest. To install pytest::   $ conda install -c conda-forge pytestAnd for matplotlib image testing with pytest::   $ conda install -c conda-forge pytest-mplAfter installation, you can launch the test suite from outside thesource directory (you will need to have pytest installed and for the mplargument need pytest-mpl)::   $ pytest --mpl --pyargs actIn-place installs can be tested using the `pytest` command from withinthe source directory.</longdescription>
