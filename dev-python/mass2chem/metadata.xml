	<longdescription># mass2chem - common utilities in interpreting mass spectrometry dataAnnotation and Inferrence## Included or work in progress* Handling chemical formula * A list of common mass values, including contaminants* A list of common adducts, rules, while they are more directly ready in future Azimuth## to include* Chemical similary computing* Reaction inference, including mass diff corresponding to common reactions* hook/adaptor to other tools## Added basic formula based calculationsNote: RE based formula parsing is still limited.Pychemy isn't good fit, as 1) high-resolution calculation needs update2) Open babel binding is not worthy the troubleE.g. in pychemy.adducts, it's wrong to use ('M+3H', 0.33,  1.0073),because the computing/rounding error in 0.33 (correct is 1/3) is far too large for mass precision.Pychemy is included as stripped version in &quot;mass2chem.chem&quot; for now, but only used for formula handling.It may be removed completely in future versions.For high-resolution measurements, electrons should be considered too.## Relatedhttps://github.com/shuzhao-li/metDataModelhttps://github.com/shuzhao-li/asari Third party:https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy/blob/devel/cobra/core/formula.py (they are using average molecular weight, not mass spec oriented)https://github.com/domdfcoding/chemistry_tools## Dev noteThe organization of this repo will change, after compatibility check on application packages. </longdescription>
