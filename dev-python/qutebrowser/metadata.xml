Awesome! Please readlink:doc/contributing.asciidoc[the contribution guidelines] for details anduseful hints.If you found a bug or have a feature request, you can report it in severalways:* Use the built-in `:report` command or the automatic crash dialog.* Open an issue in the Github issue tracker.* Write a mail to thehttps://listi.jpberlin.de/mailman/listinfo/qutebrowser[mailinglist] atmailto:qutebrowser@lists.qutebrowser.org[].Please report security bugs to security@qutebrowser.org(or if GPG encryption is desired, contact me@the-compiler.org with GPG IDhttps://www.the-compiler.org/pubkey.asc[0x916EB0C8FD55A072]).Alternatively,https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/security/advisories/new[report a vulnerability]via GitHub'shttps://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability[private reporting feature].Requirements------------The following software and libraries are required to run qutebrowser:* https://www.python.org/[Python] 3.8 or newer* https://www.qt.io/[Qt], either 6.2.0 or newer, or 5.15.0 or newer, with the following modules:  - QtCore / qtbase  - QtQuick (part of qtbase or qtdeclarative in some distributions)  - QtSQL (part of qtbase in some distributions)  - QtDBus (part of qtbase in some distributions; note that a connection to DBus at    runtime is optional)  - QtOpenGL  - QtWebEngine (if using Qt 5, 5.15.2 or newer), or  - alternatively QtWebKit (5.212) - **This is not recommended** due to known security    issues in QtWebKit, you most likely want to use qutebrowser with the    default QtWebEngine backend (based on Chromium) instead. Quoting the    https://github.com/qtwebkit/qtwebkit/releases[QtWebKit releases page]:    _[The latest QtWebKit] release is based on [an] old WebKit revision with knownunpatched vulnerabilities.
