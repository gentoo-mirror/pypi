	<longdescription>=================================== Create and manage bundle packages===================================:Version: 1.1.2Synopsis========A bundle consists of several packages, and can be used as a shortcut inapplications and libraries requirements lists.Bundles are used to follow acommon group of packages, or a package with an optional extension feature.This distribution lets you create bundles, and may also be able to manageinstalled bundles in the future.Usage=====You can create and upload a bundle to PyPI::    &gt;&gt;&gt; b = Bundle(&quot;mybundle&quot;, description=&quot;Cool bundle&quot;,                  version=&quot;1.0.0&quot;,                  requires=[&quot;pkg1&quot;, &quot;pkg2&gt;1.3&quot;, &quot;pkg3&quot;],                  author=&quot;George Costanza&quot;,                  author_email=&quot;george@vandelay.com&quot;,                  url=&quot;http://vandelay.com&quot;,                  license=&quot;BSD&quot;)    &gt;&gt;&gt; b.upload()Note that this requires a ``.pypirc`` containing your PyPI login information.As a setuptools plugin----------------------If you use bundles for extension dependencies then you can use ``setup.py``to manage them.If you have a library called ``george``, with bundles defined in ``george.bundles``like this::    from bundle.extensions import Dist    # version must be a tuple of at least 2 elements,    # e.g. (1, 2), or (1, 2, 6).    from george import VERSION    defaults = {&quot;author&quot;: &quot;George Costanza&quot;,                &quot;author_email&quot;: &quot;art@vandelay.com&quot;,                &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://vandelay.com&quot;,                &quot;license&quot;: &quot;BSD&quot;}    george = Dist(&quot;george&quot;, VERSION, **defaults)    bundles = [        george.Bundle(&quot;george-with-django&quot;,                      &quot;Bundle installing george and Django&quot;,                      requires=['django&gt;=1.2']),        george.Bundle(&quot;george-in-production&quot;,                      &quot;Bundle for george and deps suitable for production&quot;,                      requires=[&quot;celery&quot;, &quot;psycopg2&quot;, &quot;ultrajson&quot;]),    ]With your bundles list you can now tell ``setup.py`` where to find it,by adding it to the ``bundle.bundles`` entrypoints.In george's ``setup.py`` add::    setup(        ...        entry_points = {            &quot;bundle.bundles&quot;: [&quot;george = george.bundles:bundles&quot;]        },    )And then you can manage your bundles with the ``register_bundles``,``upload_bundles``, and ``upload_bundles_fix`` setup commands::    $ python setup.py upload_bundlesNote that you need run ``setup.py develop`` or ``setup.py install``first, so that the entry points are properly installed before yourun bundle commands.  And you need to have your PyPI credentialsproperly setup in your `~/.pypirc` file.The commands are::upload_bundles:    Uploads bundles to PyPI, but only the bundles for which version    has not been uploaded before.:register_bundles:    Register the bundles at PyPI.  ``upload_bundles`` will also    register, but this is useful if you only need to change metadata    without uploading a new version.:upload_bundles_fix:    Bumps the last version number for all of the bundles    and uploads the bundles to PyPI.Installation============You can install `Bundle` either via the Python Package Index (PyPI)or from source.To install using `pip`,::    $ pip install bundleTo install using `easy_install`,::    $ easy_install bundleIf you have downloaded a source tarball you can install itby doing the following,::    $ python setup.py build    # python setup.py install # as rootGetting Help============Bug tracker===========If you have any suggestions, bug reports or annoyances please report themto our issue tracker at http://github.com/ask/bundle/issues/Contributing============Development of `Bundle` happens at Github: http://github.com/ask/bundleYou are highly encouraged to participate in the development.
