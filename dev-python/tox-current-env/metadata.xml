	<longdescription>===============tox-current-env===============---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------`tox &lt;https://tox.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_  plugin to run tests in current Python environment---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The ``tox-current-env`` plugin adds these options:``tox --current-env``   Runs the tox testenv's ``commands`` in the current Python environment   (that is, the environment where ``tox`` is invoked from and installed in).   Unlike regular ``tox`` invocation, this installs no dependencies declared in ``deps``.   An attempt to run this with a Python version that doesn't match will fail   (if ``tox`` is invoked from an Python 3.7 environment, any non 3.7 testenv will fail).``tox --print-deps-to=FILE``    Instead of running any ``commands``, simply prints the    `declared dependencies &lt;https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#conf-deps&gt;`_    in ``deps`` to the specified ``FILE``.    This is useful for preparing the current environment for ``tox --current-env``.    Use ``-`` for ``FILE`` to print to standard output.``tox --print-extras-to=FILE``    Instead of running any ``commands``, simply prints the names of the    `declared extras &lt;https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#conf-extras&gt;`_    in ``extras`` to the specified ``FILE``.    This is useful for preparing the current environment for ``tox --current-env``.    Use ``-`` for ``FILE`` to print to standard output.It is possible to use the two printing options together, as long as the ``FILE`` is different.Invoking ``tox`` without any of the above options should behave as regular ``tox`` invocation without this plugin.Any deviation from this behavior is considered a bug.The plugin disables *tox's way* of providing a testing environment,but assumes that you supply one in *some other way*.Always run ``tox`` with this plugin in a fresh isolated environment,such as Python virtualenv, Linux container or chroot.\See other caveats below.Motivation----------Obviously, ``tox`` was created to run tests in isolated Python virtual environments.The ``--current-env`` flag totally defeats the purpose of ``tox``.Why would anybody do that, you might ask?Well, it turns out that ``tox`` became too popular and gained another purpose.The Python ecosystem now has formal `specifications &lt;https://packaging.python.org/specifications/&gt;`_ for many pieces of package metadata like versions or dependencies.However, there is no standardization yet for declaring *test dependencies* or *running tests*.The most popular de-facto standard for that today is ``tox``,and we expect a future standard to evolve from ``tox.ini``.This plugin lets us use ``tox``'s dependency lists and testing commands for environments other than Python venvs.We hope this plugin will enable community best practices around ``tox`` configurationto grow to better accomodate non-virtualenv environments in general â€“ for example,Linux distros, Conda, or containers.Specifically, this plugin was created for `Fedora &lt;https://fedoralovespython.org/&gt;`_'s needs.When we package Python software as RPM packages, we try to run the project's test suite during package build.However, we need to test if the software works integrated into Fedora,not with packages downloaded from PyPI into a fresh environment.By running the tests in *current environment*, we can achieve that.If you are interested in the RPM packaging part of this,see Fedora's `%pyproject RPM macros &lt;https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/pyproject-rpm-macros&gt;`_.Installation------------Install this via ``pip``:.. code-block:: console   $ python -m pip install tox-current-envOr install the development version by cloning `the git repository &lt;https://github.com/fedora-python/tox-current-env&gt;`_and ``pip``-installing locally:.. code-block:: console   $ git clone https://github.com/fedora-python/tox-current-env   $ cd tox-current-env   $ python -m pip install -e .Usage-----When the plugin is installed,use ``tox`` with ``--current-env``, ``--print-deps-to`` or ``--print-extras-to``and all the other options as usual.Assuming your ``tox`` is installed on Python 3.7:.. code-block:: console   $ tox -e py37 --current-env   py37 create: /home/pythonista/projects/holy-grail/tests/.tox/py37   py37 installed: ...list of packages from the current environment...   py37 run-test-pre: PYTHONHASHSEED='3333333333'   py37 run-test: commands...   ...runs tests in current environment's Python...   ___________________________________ summary ____________________________________     py37: commands succeeded     congratulations :)Attempting to run the ``py36`` environment's test will fail:.. code-block:: console   $ tox -e py36 --current-env   py36 create: /home/pythonista/projects/holy-grail/tests/.tox/py36   ERROR: InterpreterMismatch: tox_current_env: interpreter versions do not match:       in current env: (3, 7, 4, 'final', 0)       requested: (3, 6, 9, 'final', 0)   ___________________________________ summary ____________________________________   ERROR:  py36: InterpreterMismatch: tox_current_env: interpreter versions do not match:       in current env: (3, 7, 4, 'final', 0)       requested: (3, 6, 9, 'final', 0)To get list of test dependencies, run:.. code-block:: console   $ tox -e py37 --print-deps-to -   py37 create: /home/pythonista/projects/holy-grail/tests/.tox/py37   py37 installed: ...you can see almost anything here...   py37 run-test-pre: PYTHONHASHSEED='3333333333'   dep1   dep2   ...   ___________________________________ summary ____________________________________     py37: commands succeeded     congratulations :)To get a list of names of extras, run:.. code-block:: console   $ tox -e py37 --print-extras-to -   py37 create: /home/pythonista/projects/holy-grail/tests/.tox/py37   py37 installed: ...you can see almost anything here...   py37 run-test-pre: PYTHONHASHSEED='3333333333'   extra1   extra2   ...   ___________________________________ summary ____________________________________     py37: commands succeeded     congratulations :)Caveats, warnings and limitations---------------------------------tox 4~~~~~The plugin is available also for tox 4. Differences in behavior between tox 3 and 4 are these:- ``--recreate`` is no longer needed when you switch from the plugin back to standard tox.  Tox detects it and handles the recreation automatically.- The plugin does not check the requested Python version nor the environment name.  If you let it run for multiple environments they'll all use the same Python.- Deprecated ``--print-deps-only`` option is no longer available.Use an isolated environment~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Running (especially third party software's) tests in your system Python environment is dangerous.Always use this plugin in an isolated environment,such as a Linux container, virtual machine or chroot.You have been warned.Do not rely on virtualenv details~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In order to support the ``python`` command in the ``commands`` section,the current environment invocation of ``tox`` creates a fake virtual environmentthat just has a symbolic link to the Python executable.The link is named ``python`` even if the real interpreter's name is different(such as ``python3.7`` or ``pypy``).Any other commands are not linked anywhere and it is the users' responsibilityto make sure such commands are in ``$PATH`` and use the correct Python.This can lead to slightly different results of tests than invoking them directly,especially if you have assumptions about ``sys.executable`` or other commandsin your tests.As a specific example, tests should invoke ``python -m pytest`` rather than assumingthe ``pytest`` command is present and uses the correct version of Python.Don't mix current-env and regular tox runs~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~tox caches the virtualenvs it creates, and doesn't distinguish betweenregular virtualenvs and ``--current-env``.Don't mix ``tox --current-env``, ``tox --print-deps-to`` or ``tox --print-extras-to``runs and regular ``tox`` runs (without the flags provided by this plugin).If you ever need to do this, use tox's ``--recreate/-r`` flag to clear the cache.The plugin should abort with a meaningful error message if this is detected,but in some corner cases (such as running ``tox --current-env``,forcefully killing it before it finished, uninstalling the plugin,and running ``tox``), you will get undefined results(such as installing packages from PyPI into your current environment).Environment variables are passed by default~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Since 0.0.9, all Shell environment variables are passed by default when usingthis plugin. The `passenv` tox configuration is set to `*`.Read `the documentation for more information about passing environment variables to tox&lt;https://tox.wiki/en/latest/config.html#passenv&gt;`_.tox provisioning~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The tested projects can specify the`minimal tox version &lt;https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#conf-minversion&gt;`_and/or`additional requires &lt;https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#conf-requires&gt;`_needed in the environment where ``tox`` is installed.Normally, ``tox`` uses *provisioning* when such requirements are not met.It creates a virtual environment,installs (a newer version of) ``tox`` and the missing packagesinto that environment and proxies all ``tox`` invocations trough that.Unfortunately, this is undesired for ``tox-current-env``. 1. It is possible to invoke ``tox`` with ``--no-provision``    to prevent the provision entirely.    When requirements are missing, ``tox`` fails instead of provisioning.    If a path is passed as a value for ``--no-provision``,    the requirements will be serialized to the file, as JSON. 2. The requires, if specified, are included in the    results of ``tox --print-deps-to``.    This only works when they are installed (otherwise see the first point). 3. The minimal tox version, if specified, is included in the results of    ``tox --print-deps-to``.    This only works when the version requirement is satisfied    (otherwise see the first point).The recommend way to handle this is: 1. Run ``tox --no-provision provision.json --print-deps-to=...`` or similar. 2. If the command fails, install requirements from ``provision.json`` to the    current environment and try again.Note that the specified requirements are likely to contain`other tox plugins &lt;https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html&gt;`_and many of them might interfere with ``tox-current-env`` in an undesired way.If that is the case, the recommended way is to patch/sed such undesired pluginsout of the configuration before running ``tox``.Other limitations and known bugs~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The ``installed:`` line in the output of ``tox --print-deps-to``/``tox --print-extras-to`` shows irrelevant output(based on the content of the real or faked virtual environment).Regardless of any `Python flags &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html&gt;`_ used in the shebang of ``tox``,the tests are invoked with ``sys.executable`` without any added flags(unless explicitly invoked with them in the ``commands`` section).The current environment's Python is tested for the major and minor version only.Different interpreters with the same Python version (such as CPython and PyPy) are treated as equal.Only Linux is supported, with special emphasis on Fedora.This plugin might work on other Unix-like systems,but does not work on Microsoft Windows.This is alpha quality software.Use it at your on your own risk.Pull requests with improvements are welcome.Development, issues, support----------------------------The development happens on GitHub,at the `fedora-python/tox-current-env &lt;https://github.com/fedora-python/tox-current-env&gt;`_ repository.You can use the `issue tracker &lt;https://github.com/fedora-python/tox-current-env/issues&gt;`_  there for any discussionor send Pull Requests.Tests~~~~~In order to run the tests, you'll need ``tox`` and Python from 3.6 to 3.10 installed.The integration tests assume all of them are available.On Fedora, you just need to ``dnf install tox``.Run ``tox`` to invoke the tests.Running tests of this plugin with its own ``--current-env`` flag will most likely blow up.License-------The ``tox-current-env`` project is licensed under the so-called MIT license, full text available in the `LICENSE &lt;https://github.com/fedora-python/tox-current-env/blob/master/LICENSE&gt;`_ file.Code of Conduct---------------The ``tox-current-env`` project follows the `Fedora's Code of Conduct &lt;https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/code-of-conduct/&gt;`_.</longdescription>
