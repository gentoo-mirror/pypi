	<longdescription>``utopya``: A simulation management and evaluation framework============================================================The ``utopya`` package provides a simulation management and evaluationframework with the following feature set:- **Run model simulations** in parallel and on cluster architectures  - Conveniently perform parameter sweeps of arbitrary parameters with the help    of the `paramspace &lt;https://gitlab.com/blsqr/paramspace&gt;`_ package.- A **powerful CLI** to run and evaluate models, including interactive plotting- Integrates the `dantro &lt;https://gitlab.com/utopia-project/dantro&gt;`_  **data processing pipeline**:  - Loads data into a hierarchical data tree, supplying a uniform interface  - Gives access to a configuration-based **data transformation framework**,    separating data preprocessing from visualization for increased generality  - Easy extensibility of plot creators via model-specific plot implementations- A **versatile configuration interface** for both simulation and evaluation:  - Assembling multi-level model configurations, including several default    levels  - Assembling plot configurations with multiple inheritance, reducing    redundant definitions- Model, project, and framework registration and handling- Managing data output directories- Tools to simplify model test implementations or working without a CLI- ... and moreThe ``utopya`` package evolved as part of the`Utopia Project &lt;https://utopia-project.org&gt;`_ and provides the frontend ofthe `Utopia modelling framework &lt;https://gitlab.com/utopia-project/utopia&gt;`_.Having been outsourced from that project, it can be used with arbitrary modelimplementations with a very low barrier for entry: in the simplest case, onlythe path to an executable is required to run simulations.With more compliance to the utopya interface, more features become available.The ``utopya`` package is **open source software** released under the`LGPLv3+ &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html&gt;`_ license.Visit the `utopya project website &lt;https://gitlab.com/utopia-project/utopya&gt;`_or the `documentation page &lt;https://utopya.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_ for moreinformation about utopya.</longdescription>
