	<longdescription>==========Python VAT==========.. image:: https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/al45tair/vat/status.png   :target: https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/al45tair/vat/latest   :alt: Build StatusWhat is this?-------------It’s a package of useful Python code relating to VAT, that’s what.  Itincludes- Tables mapping ISO alpha 2 country codes to VAT codes and vice-versa- Tables of VAT number formats- Tables of VAT rates, thresholds and registration periods- Support for querying the VIES VAT database system (to check VAT details),  *including fuzzy matching support for names and addresses*- Utility functions for UK VAT (in the vat.gb package), including  * EC sales list XML generation  * Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) return generationA few words about VAT---------------------In the European Union, companies are expected to charge and account for ValueAdded Tax (VAT).  This has a variety of other names (IVA, TVA, MwSt., USt.,BTW, ДДС, ΦΠΑ, DPH, PDV, Moms, km, ALV, ÁFA, CBL, PVN, PVM, PTU, DDV, IGIC andTAW), but it’s the same basic idea, and the rules are---to someextent---harmonised.From the consumer’s perspective, VAT is a sales tax. However, from abusiness’ perspective, it is not; unlike a sales tax, businesses charge VAT to*everybody*, whether or not they are a business customer, and are able tooffset the VAT they have to pay over to the tax authority against the VAT theyhave themselves paid.Sounds simple?  Hah!  You have *no* idea.The first problem is that all of the different countries have their own ratesfor VAT, and most of them have at least two rates that apply to differentcategories of goods and services.  The second problem is cross-bordertransactions; depending on the nature of the transaction, the supplier may ormay not be expected to charge VAT to the purchaser, and when they do not, thepurchaser will generally be expected to account for VAT under the “reversecharge” rules (essentially by charging himself VAT, which will normally resultin no payment to the tax authority because the amount to be paid will beoffset entirely by itself).There are all kinds of additional complications---some member states operateregistration thresholds, others don’t; some provide a grace period forregistration, in others you’ve broken the law if you make a supply that takesyou over the threshold; some allow you to register and submit returnsyourself, others require that you hire people to do it for you; and so on.One further niggle is that **suppliers of electronic services outside of theEuropean Union are expected to charge VAT to their European customers**.  Manydon’t, with the result that their products can be priced more competitivelythan would be possible for a company operating within the European Union.DISCLAIMER----------**It is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY if you use this code to check that the rates andthresholds you are using are the correct ones.  The author cannot be heldliable for errors in this material, particularly as much of it comes fromdocuments on the EU website that may be out of date and that themselvesinclude disclaimers.**Documentation-------------The documentation for this package is available on `Read the Docs&lt;http://vat.readthedocs.org/en/latest&gt;`_.</longdescription>
