	<longdescription># Introduction`fortune` is a stripped-down implementation of the classic BSD Unix`fortune` command. It combines the capabilities of the `strfile` command(which produces the fortune index file) and the `fortune` command (whichdisplays a random fortune). It reads the traditional `fortune` program'stext file format.# UsageUsage:    fortune [OPTIONS] /path/to/fortunes    OPTIONS    -h, --help      Show usage and exit.    -u, --update    Update the index file.    -q, --quiet     When updating the index file, do so quietly.    -V, --version   Show version and exit.If you omit the path, `fortune` looks at the `FORTUNE_FILE` environmentvariable. If that environment variable isn't set, `fortune` aborts.# Fortune Cookie File FormatA fortune cookie file is a text file full of quotes. The format is simple:The file consists of paragraphs separated by lines containing a single '%'character. For example::    A little caution outflanks a large cavalry.        -- Bismarck    %    A little retrospection shows that although many fine, useful software    systems have been designed by committees and built as part of multipart    projects, those software systems that have excited passionate fans are    those that are the products of one or a few designing minds, great    designers. Consider Unix, APL, Pascal, Modula, the Smalltalk interface,    even Fortran; and contrast them with Cobol, PL/I, Algol, MVS/370, and    MS-DOS.        -- Fred Brooks, Jr.    %    A man is not old until regrets take the place of dreams.        -- John Barrymore# Generating a Random FortuneJust run:    fortune /path/to/fortunesIf your `FORTUNE_FILE` environment variable is set, you can run it as    fortune# DifferencesThis version of `fortune` does not provide some of the more advancedcapabilities of the original BSD program. For instance, it lacks:- the ability to mark offensive and inoffensive fortunes- the ability to separate long and short quotes- the ability to print all fortunes matching a regular expressionIt does, however, provide the most important function: The ability to displaya random quote from a set of quotes.</longdescription>
