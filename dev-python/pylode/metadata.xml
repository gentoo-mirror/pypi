It doesn't yet handle all the various &quot;profiles&quot; that pyLODE 2.13.2 does, such as SKOS 'vocabularies' &amp; Profiles Vocabulary 'profiles', it only handles OWL 'ontologies', nor all the special data types, such as JSON literals, BUT, it generates HTML in a much more straightforward manner and the code is both more efficient and much more maintainable, which is why it's been made.v 3.x will eventually catch up to all of v 2.13.2's features.To access v 2.13.2 of pyLODE, either `download it from PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pyLODE/2.13.2/&gt;`_ , `check it out from GitHub &lt;https://github.com/RDFLib/pyLODE/releases/tag/2.13.2&gt;`_ or access it via the `online service &lt;http://pylode.surroundaustralia.com/&gt;`_ .----Contents========1. `Quick Intro`_2.

Contacts_Quick Intro===========The Live OWL Documentation Environment tool(`LODE &lt;https://github.com/essepuntato/LODE&gt;`__) is a well-known (inSemantic Web circles) Java &amp; XSLT-based tool used to generatehuman-readable HTML documents for OWL and RDF ontologies. That tool isnow a bit dated (old-style HTML, use of older technologies like XSLT)and it's (`online version &lt;https://www.essepuntato.it/lode&gt;`__) is not alwaysonline.This tool is a complete re-implementation of LODE's functionality usingPython and Python's RDF manipulation module,`rdflib &lt;https://pypi.org/project/rdflib/&gt;`__. An ontology to bedocumented is parsed and inspected using rdflib and HTML is generateddirectly, using Python's `dominate &lt;https://pypi.org/project/dominate/&gt;`__package.Use===The tool can be used in multiple ways:- BASH command line script    - pyLODE.sh in bin/- Windows EXE    - pyLODE.exe in bin/- Mac executable    - pyLODE in bin/- Python Script    - cli.py or module- as-a-service locally    - via the popular `Falcon framework &lt;https://falconframework.org/&gt;`__.    - see server.py in the main folder- as-a-service online    - hosted at https://pylode.surroundaustralia.comCommand line arguments----------------------The BASH, Windows EXE and Python Script methods all use the same command linearguments:::    usage: cli.py [-h] [-v] [-o OUTPUTFILE] [-c {true,false}] input    positional arguments:        input                 Input file location or URL    optional arguments:        -h, --help          show this help message and exit        -v, --version       show program's version number and exit        -o OUTPUTFILE,        --outputfile OUTPUTFILE                            A name you wish to assign to the output file. Will be                            postfixed with .html if not already added. If no                            output file is given, output will be printed to screen        -c {true,false},        --css {true,false}                            Whether (true) or not (false) to include CSS within an                            output HTML file.Basic Use^^^^^^^^^* as a Python script* executed in this directory::    python pylode examples/minimal.ttl -o minimal.htmlThis will produce the file ``minimal.html`` in this directory which shouldmatch exactly the file ``examples/minimal.html``.Examples========The `examples/ directory &lt;https://github.com/RDFLib/pyLODE/tree/master/examples&gt;`_contains multiple pairs of RDF &amp; HTML files generated from them using thisversion of pyLODE.You can also see rendered versions of these example files online too:* `minimal.html &lt;https://rdflib.dev/pyLODE/examples/ontdoc/minimal.html&gt;`_* `agift.html &lt;https://rdflib.dev/pyLODE/examples/ontdoc/agrif.html&gt;`_* `alternates.html &lt;https://rdflib.dev/pyLODE/examples/ontdoc/alternates.html&gt;`_* `asgs.html &lt;https://rdflib.dev/pyLODE/examples/ontdoc/asgs.html&gt;`_What pyLODE understands=======================pyLODE knows about definitional ontologies (``owl:Ontology``) and the majorelements usually found in them, such as classes (``owl:Class`` or ``rdf:Class)and properties (``rdf:Property`` &amp; ``owl:ObjectProperty`` etc.).To see what properties for ontology, class and RDF property documentationpyLODE currently supports, just look in the ``rdf_elements.py`` file. Allelements' properties supported are given in property lists there.pyLODES won't just translate everything that you can describe in RDF intoHTML! This is a conscious design choice to ensure that a certain conventionalstyle of documented ontology is produced. However, support for newproperties and ontology patterns can be made - just create an Issue on`this project's Issue tracker &lt;https://github.com/RDFLib/pyLODE/issues&gt;`__.While it *does* know about instance data, such as Named Individuals, it'snot really designed to document large ontologies containing class instances.Notes on Agents---------------pyLODE can understand both simple and complex Agent objects. You can usesimple string properties like ``dc:contributor &quot;Nicholas J. Car&quot;`` too ifyou really must but better would be to take advantage of real Linked Datarepresentation, e.g. complex Agent objects with web addresses, emails,affiliations, ORCIDs and so on, e.g.:::    &lt;ontology_x&gt;        dct:creator [            sdo:name &quot;Nicholas J. Car&quot; ;            sdo:identifier &lt;http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8742-7730&gt; ;            sdo:affiliation [                sdo:name &quot;SURROUND Australia Pty Ldt.&quot; ;                sdo:url &quot;https://surroundaustralia.com&quot;^^xsd:anyURI ;            ] ;        ] ;See all the properties in ``rdf_elements.py:AGENT_PROPS`` for a list ofall the Agent properties pyLODE can handle.Installation============pyLODE is `on PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pyLODE/&gt;`_, so you can installit using `pip &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pip/&gt;`_ as normal:::    pip install pylodeDifferences from LODE=====================-  command line access   -  you can use this on your own desktop so you don't need me to      maintain a live service for use-  use of modern simple HTML   - no JavaScript: pyLODE generates static HTML pages-  catering for a wider range of ontology options such as:   -  schema.org ``domainIncludes`` &amp; ``rangeIncludes`` for properties-  better Agent representation   - see the `Notes on Agents`_ section above-  smarter CURIES   -  pyLODE caches and looks up well-known prefixes to make more/better      CURIES   -  it tries to be smart with CURIE presentation by CURIE-ising all      URIs it finds, rather than printing them-  reference ontologies property labels   - pyLODE caches ~ 10 well-known ontologies (RDFS, SKOS etc), properties from which people often use for their ontology documentation. Where these properties are used, the background ontology's labels are use-  **active development**   -  pyLODE has been under active development since mid-2019 and is      still very much actively developed - it's not just staying still   -  it will be improved in foreseeable to cater for more and more things   -  recent ontology documentation initiatives such as the `MOD      Ontology &lt;https://github.com/sifrproject/MOD-Ontology&gt;`__ will be      handled, if requestedReleases========pyLODE is under continual and constant development.
