	<longdescription>============cfn-pyplates============Amazon Web Services CloudFormation templates, generated with Python!..  Keep the README in-sync with intro.rst in the sphinx docs!  The travis image isn't really useful on readthedocs, and also causes  sphinx warnings, so it should be excluded... image:: https://travis-ci.org/seandst/cfn-pyplates.png    :target: https://travis-ci.org/seandst/cfn-pyplates/Where to get it===============- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cfn-pyplates/- easy_install cfn-pyplates- pip install cfn-pyplatesDocumentation=============- https://cfn-pyplates.readthedocs.org/Intended Audience=================pyplates are intended to be used with the `Amazon Web Services CloudFormation&lt;https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/&gt;`_ service. If you're already aCloudFormation (CFN) user, chances are good that you've already come up withfun and interesting ways of generating valid CFN templates. pyplates are away to make those templates while leveraging all of the power that the pythonenvironment has to offer.What is a pyplate?==================A pyplate is a class-based python representation of a JSON CloudFormationtemplate and resources, with the goal of generating cloudformationtemplates based on input python templates (pyplates!) that reflect thecloudformation template hierarchy.Features========- Allows for easy customization of templates at runtime, allowing one  pyplate to describe all of your CFN Stack roles (production, testing,  dev, staging, etc).- Lets you put comments right in the template!- Supports all required elements of a CFN template, such as Parameters,  Resources, Outputs, etc.)- Supports all intrinsic CFN functions, such as base64, get_att, ref,  etc.- Converts intuitiviely-written python dictionaries into JSON templates,  without having to worry about nesting or order-of-operations issues.</longdescription>
