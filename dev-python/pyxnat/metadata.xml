Yet some tests were not allowed torun due to restricted permissions.In v1.1, tests were restructured and were directed to two independent XNATinstances based on permission level. Hence `XNAT Central &lt;http://central.xnat.org&gt;`_is still used for most tests with read access whereas other tests requiringwrite permissions are run on a local XNAT instance in a Docker container.Consequently, running the test suite now requires the following:  - *python-nose* v1.2.1+  - *coverage* v3.6+  - *docker* v18+Setting up a local Docker-powered XNAT instance may be achieved easily using``docker-compose`` and any available recipe. We recommend the one from the`following repository &lt;https://github.com/NrgXnat/xnat-docker-compose&gt;`_(maintained by the XNAT team). Once the repository cloned, run the followingcommand (possibly as ``sudo``) ::  docker-compose up -dAfter a couple of minutes, the XNAT instance should be up and running locally.You may check it out visiting http://localhost.The script ``tests/setup_xnat.py`` may then be executed to populate the localinstance before running the tests.Finally run the tests with the following command (from the root of the project)::    nosetests pyxnat/testsThe file ``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` (used for CI) features these describedsteps and may be referred to for further information.Building the documentation==========================Building the docs requires to have `setuptools &lt;https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/&gt;`_and `sphinx &lt;http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/&gt;`_ (v2.0+) installed.Then run the command::    python setup.py build_sphinxThe docs are built in the ``build/sphinx/html`` folder.Contribute to **pyxnat**=========================To contribute to **pyxnat**, first create an account on `GitHub&lt;http://github.com/&gt;`_. Once this is done, fork the `pyxnat repository&lt;http://github.com/pyxnat/pyxnat&gt;`_ to have you own repository,clone it using ``git clone`` on the computers where you want to work. Makechanges in your clone, push them to your GitHub fork, test themon several computers and when you are happy with them, send a `pullrequest &lt;https://github.com/pyxnat/pyxnat/issues&gt;`_ to the main repository.License=======`BSD 3 &lt;LICENSE&gt;`_</longdescription>
