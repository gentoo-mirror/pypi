In PsyNeuLink, components areused to implement the function of brain subsystems and/or psychological processes, the interaction of which can thenbe simulated at the system level.The purpose of PsyNeuLink is to make it as easy as possible to create new and/or import existing models, andintegrate them to simluate system-level interactions.  It provides a suite of core components forimplementing models of various forms of processing, learning, and control, and its Library includes examples thatcombine these components to implement published models.  As an open source project, its suite of components is meantto be enhanced and extended, and its library is meant to provide an expanding repository of models, written in aconcise, executable, and easy to interpret form, that can be shared, compared, and extended by the scientific community.What PsyNeuLink **IS**----------------------It is: - *open source*, freeing users of the costs or restrictions associated with proprietary software. .. - *computationally general* -- it can be used to implement, seamlessly integrate, and simulate interactions among   disparate components that vary in their granularity of representation and function (from individual neurons or   neural populations to functional subsystems and abstract cognitive functions) and at any time scale of execution. .. - *integrative* -- it provides a standard and accessible environment for model comparison, sharing, and documentation; .. - *extensible* -- it has an interface (API) that allows it to be used with other powerful tools for implementing   individual components, such as:    * Neuron and Nengo (biophysically realistic models of neuronal function)    * Emergent (broad class of neurally-plausible connectionist models);    * Pytorch and TensorFlow (ODE's, deep learning);    * ACT-R (symbolic, production system models)... note::   PsyNeuLink is alpha software, that is still being actively developed.  Although it is useable, and most of the   documented functionality is available, some features may not yet be fully implemented and/or subject to   modification.  Please report any bugs and/or suggestions for development to psyneulinkhelp@princeton.edu.What PsyNeuLink is **NOT**--------------------------The longterm goal of PsyNeuLink is to provide an environment that integrates comptutational modeling of brain functionand behavior at all levels of analysis.  While it is designed to be fully general, and can in principle be used toimplement models at any level, it is still under development, and current efficiency considerations make it moresuitable for some of forms of modeling than others. In its present form, it is well suited to the creation ofsimple to moderately complex models, and for the integration of disparate models into a single environment, while init is presently less well suited to efforts involving massively large computations, such as: - extensive model fitting - large scale simulations - highly detailed biophysical models of neurons or neuronal populationsOther packages currently better suited to such applications are:`Emergent &lt;https://grey.colorado.edu/emergent/index.php/Main_Page&gt;`_ for biologically-inspired neural network models`Pytorch &lt;https://pytorch.org&gt;`_ and `TensorFlow &lt;https://www.tensorflow.org&gt;`_ (for deep learning models);`HDDM &lt;http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/&gt;`_ (for Drift Diffusion Models);`ACT-R &lt;http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu&gt;`_ (for production system models);`Genesis &lt;http://www.genesis-sim.org&gt;`_,`Neuron &lt;https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/&gt;`_,and `Nengo &lt;http://www.nengo.ca&gt;`_  (for biophysically-realistic models of neuronal function).These packages are good for elaborate and detailed models of a particular form. In contrast, the focus in designingPsyNeuLink has been to make it as flexible and easy to use as possible, with the ability to integrate componentsconstructed in other packages (including some of the ones listed above) into a single environment.  These arecharacteristics that are often (at least in the initial stages of development) in tension with efficiency (think:interpreted vs. compiled).That said, priorities for ongoing development of PsyNeuLink are:    i) acceleration, using just-in-time compilation methods and parallelization       (see `Compilation`, and `Vesely et al., 2022 &lt;http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/abhishek/jvesely-cgo22.pdf&gt;`_);    ii) enhancement of the API to facilitate wrapping modules from other packages for integration into the PsyNeuLink        environment (examples currently exist for `Pytorch &lt;https://pytorch.org&gt;`_ ) and translating into a standard        `Model Description Format (MDF) &lt;https://github.com/ModECI/MDF&gt;`_;    iii) integration of tools for parameter estimation, model comparison and data fitting         (see `ParameterEstimationComposition`); and    iv) a graphic interface for the construction of models and realtime display of their execution        (see `PsyNeuLinkView &lt;http://www.psyneuln.deptcpanel.princeton.edu/psyneulink-view-2/&gt;`_).Environment Overview--------------------PsyNeuLink is written in Python, and conforms to the syntax, coding standards and modular organization shared bymost Python packages.  BasicsAndPrimer provides an orientation to PsyNeuLinks Components, some examples of whatPsyNeuLink models look like, and some of its capabilities. QuickReference provides an overview of how PsyNeuLink isorganized and some of its basic principles of operation.  The Tutorial provides an interactive guide to theconstruction of models using PsyNeuLink. Core contains the fundamental objects used to build PsyNeuLink models, andLibrary contains extensions, including speciality components, implemented compositions, and published models.Installation------------PsyNeuLink is compatible with python versions &gt;= 3.5, and is available through `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PsyNeuLink&gt;`__:::    pip install psyneulinkAll prerequisite packages will be automatically added to your environment.If you downloaded the source code, navigate to the cloned directory in a terminal,switch to your preferred python3 environment, then run::    pip install .Dependencies that are automatically installed (except those noted as optional) include:   * numpy   * matplotlib   * toposort   * typecheck-decorator (version 1.2)   * pillow   * llvmlite   * mpi4py (optional)   * autograd (optional)Lists of required packages for PsyNeuLink, developing PsyNeuLink, and running the PsyNeuLink tutorial are alsostored in pip-style `requirements.txt`, `dev_requirements.txt`, and `tutorial_requirements.txt` in the source code.PsyNeuLink is an open source project maintined on `GitHub &lt;https://github.com&gt;`_.
