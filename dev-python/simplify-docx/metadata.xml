	<longdescription># OverviewDOCX files are complex, and their complexity makes scraping documentsfor their content difficult. The aim of this package is to simplify`.docx` files to just the components which carry meaning, thereby easing theprocess of pattern matching and data extraction by converting a `.docx`file into a predictable and *human readable* JSON file.Simplifying a complex document down to it's *meaningful* parts of courserequires taking a position on what does and does-not convey meaning in adocument. Generally, this package takes the stance that the documentstructure (body, paragraphs, tables, etc.) are meaningful as is the textitself, whereas text styling (font, font-weight, etc.) is ignored almostentirely, with the exception of paragraph indentation and numbering whichis often used to create lists, block quotes, etc.  Furthermore, theopinions expressed by this package are explained in the Options sectionbelow and can be changed to suite your needs.# Usage```pythonimport docxfrom simplify_docx import simplify# read in a document my_doc = docx.Document(&quot;/path/to/my/favorite/file.docx&quot;)# coerce to JSON using the standard optionsmy_doc_as_json = simplify(my_doc)# or with non-standard optionsmy_doc_as_json = simplify(my_doc,{&quot;remove-leading-white-space&quot;:False})```# InstallationThis project relies on the `python-docx` package which can be installed via`pip install python-docx`. **However**, as of this writing, if you wish toscrape documents which contain (A) form fields such as drop down lists,checkboxes and text inputs or (B) nested documents (subdocs, altChunks,etc.), you'll need to clone [this fork](https://github.com/jdthorpe/python-docx) of the python-docx package.# Options### General* **&quot;friendly-name&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Use user-friendly type namessuch as &quot;table-cell&quot;, over standard element names like &quot;CT_Tc&quot;* **&quot;merge-consecutive-text&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Sentences and even singlewords can be represented by multiple text elements. If `True`,concatenate consecutive text elements into a single text element.### Ignoring Invisible things* **&quot;ignore-empty-paragraphs&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Empty paragraphs areoften used for styling purpose and rarely have significance in themeaning of the document.* **&quot;ignore-empty-text&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Empty text runs can make anotherwise empty paragraph appear to contain data.* **&quot;remove-leading-white-space&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Leading white-spaceat the start of a paragraph is ocassionaly used for styling purposesand rarely has significance in the interpretation of a document.* **&quot;remove-trailing-white-space&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Trailing white-spaceat the end of a paragraph rarely has significance in the interpretationof a document.* **&quot;flatten-inner-spaces&quot;**: (*Default = `False`*): Collapse multiplespace characters between words to a single space.* **&quot;ignore-joiners&quot;**: (*Default = `False`*): Zero width joiner and non-joiner characters are special characters used to create ligatures in displayedtext and don't typically convey meaning (at least in alphabet basedlanguages).### Special symbols* **&quot;dumb-quotes&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Replace smart quotes withdumb quotes.* **&quot;dumb-hyphens&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Replace en-dash, em-dash,figure-dash, horizontal bar, and non-breaking hyphens with ordinary hyphens.* **&quot;dumb-spaces&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Replace zero width spaces, hair spaces, thin spaces, punctuation spaces, figure spaces, six per emspaces, four per em spaces, three per em spaces, em spaces, en spaces,em quad spaces, and en quad spaces with ordinary spaces.* **&quot;special-characters-as-text&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Coerce specialcharacters into text equivalents according to the following table:| Character | Text Equivalent | | --------- | --------------- | | CarriageReturn | `\n` || Break | `\r` || TabChar | `\t` || PositionalTab | `\t` || NoBreakHyphen | `-` || SoftHyphen | `-` |* **&quot;symbol-as-text&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Special symbols often carymeaning other than the underlying unicode character, especially whenthe font is a special font such as `Wingdings`. If `True` these areincluded as ordinary text and their font information is omitted.* **&quot;empty-as-text&quot;**: (*Default = `False`*): There are a variety of &quot;Empty&quot;tags such as the `&lt;&quot;w:yearLong&quot;&gt;` tag which cause the current year tobe inserted into the document text. If `True`, include these as textformatted as `&quot;[yearLong]&quot;`.* **&quot;ignore-left-to-right-mark&quot;**: (*Default = `False`*): Ignore the left-to-rightmark, which is not writeable by pythons csv writer.* **&quot;ignore-right-to-left-mark&quot;**: (*Default = `False`*): Ignore the right-to-leftmark which is not writeable by pythons csv writer.### Paragraph style:Paragraph style markup are one exception to the styling vs. contentdichotomy. For example, block quotes are often indicated by indenting wholeparagraphs, and Ordered lists, Unordered lists and nesting of lists isoften used to divide sections of a document into logical components. * **&quot;include-paragraph-indent&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Include theindentation markup on paragraph (`CT_P`) elements. Indentation ismeasured in twips* **&quot;include-paragraph-numbering&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Include thenumbering styles, which are included in the `CT_P.pPr.numPr` element.The `ilvl` attribute indicates the level of nesting (zero based index)and the `numId` attribute refers to a specific numbering styleincluded in the document's internal styles sheet. ### Form Elements* **&quot;simplify-dropdown&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Include just the selectedand default values, the available options, and the name and label attributes in the form element.* **&quot;simplify-textinput&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Include just the currentand default values, and the name and label attributes in the form element.* **&quot;greedy-text-input&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Continue consuming runelements when the text-input has not ended at the end of a paragraph,and the next block level element is also a paragraph. This typicallyoccurs when the user preses the return key while editing a text inputfield.* **&quot;simplify-checkbox&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Include just the currentand default values, and the name and label attributes in the form element.* **&quot;use-checkbox-default&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): If the checkbox has no`value` attribute (typically because the user has not interacted withit), report the default value as the checkbox value.* **&quot;checkbox-as-text&quot;**: (*Default = `False`*): Coerce the value of thecheckbox to text, represented as either `&quot;[CheckBox:True]&quot;` or `&quot;[CheckBox:False]&quot;`* **&quot;dropdown-as-text&quot;**: (*Default = `False`*): Coerce the value of thecheckbox to text, represented as `&quot;[DropDown:&lt;selected value&gt;]&quot;`* **&quot;trim-dropdown-options&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Remove white-space onthe left and right of drop down option items.* **&quot;flatten-generic-field&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): `generic-fields` are`CT_FldChar` runs which are not marked as a drop-down, text-input, orcheckbox. These may include special instructions which apply specialformatting to a text run (e.g. a hyper link). If `True`, the contentsof generic-fields are included in the normal flow of text### Special content* **&quot;flatten-hyperlink&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Flatten hyperlinks, includingtheir contents in the flow of normal text.* **&quot;flatten-smartTag&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Flatten smartTag elements, including their contents in the flow of normal text.* **&quot;flatten-customXml&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Flatten customXml elements, including their contents in the flow of normal text.* **&quot;flatten-simpleField&quot;**: (*Default = `True`*): Flatten simpleField elements, including their contents in the flow of normal text.# ContributingThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
