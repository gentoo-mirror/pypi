	<longdescription># JiWERJiWER is a simple and fast python package to evaluate an automatic speech recognition system.It supports the following measures:1. word error rate (WER)2. match error rate (MER)3. word information lost (WIL) 4. word information preserved (WIP) 5. character error rate (CER)These measures are computed with the use of the minimum-edit distance between one or more reference and hypothesis sentences.The minimum-edit distance is calculated using [RapidFuzz](https://github.com/maxbachmann/RapidFuzz), which uses C++ under the hood, and is therefore faster than a pure python implementation.## DocumentationFor further info, see the documentation at [jitsi.github.io/jiwer](https://jitsi.github.io/jiwer).## InstallationYou should be able to install this package using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/): ```$ poetry add jiwer```Or, if you prefer old-fashioned pip and you're using Python &gt;= `3.7`:```bash$ pip install jiwer```## UsageThe most simple use-case is computing the word error rate between two strings:```pythonfrom jiwer import werreference = &quot;hello world&quot;hypothesis = &quot;hello duck&quot;error = wer(reference, hypothesis)```## LicenceThe jiwer package is released under the `Apache License, Version 2.0` licence by [8x8](https://www.8x8.com/).For further information, see [`LICENCE`](./LICENSE).## Reference_For a comparison between WER, MER and WIL, see: \Morris, Andrew &amp; Maier, Viktoria &amp; Green, Phil. (2004).
