	<longdescription>[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/MatejKastak/orglearn?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/MatejKastak/orglearn/blob/master/LICENSE)# OrglearnOrglearn provides toolbox for learning from your org-mode notes. It can generate mindmaps, anki decks and even pdfs textbooks.## Modes [commands]### AnkiConvert notes to anki deck. The converter will take all leafs of the tree (nodeswithout children) and convert them into anki cards. The node title isfront-side of the card and the body is the back-side of the card.### Mind mapConvert notes into a [mid map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map). This is agood way to visualize the relationships between each node.### PDFOrglearn is able to create pdf from your notes. You can achieve similar resultsconverting org files to pdf using emacs. But we think that using `pandoc`results in better looking PDFs and gives us the best way to customize the result.To be able to convert org files to pdf you need to have `pandoc` along with `pdflatex` installed onyour system.## InstallationThe latest stable release of `orglearn` can be obtained via `pypi`:```shpip install orglearn```If you wish to install the latest `master` branch:```shgit clone https://github.com/MatejKastak/orglearn &amp;&amp; cd orglearnpython -m venv env &amp;&amp; . env/bin/activate # In case you want to install in virtualenv.pip install .```## UsageBelow are some basic examples for running orglearn:```shorglearn anki file1.org # Convert org file into anki deck ./file1.apkgorglearn anki file1.org file2.org # Convert multiple files into single deck```## ContributingContributions are highly appreciated. If you choose to contribute please read the Contribution Guidelines (TBD).We are using the [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for the source codeformatting. To use it automatically prepare pre-commit hooks with the followingcommand.```shpre-commit install # Install the pre-commit hooks```### TestsUse the following command to run tests:```bashmake test```</longdescription>
