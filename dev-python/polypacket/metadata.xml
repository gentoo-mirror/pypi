Protocols are described in an YAML document which can be easily shared with all components of a system.A python script is used to parse the YAML file and generate C/C++ code as well as documentation. The code generation tool can create the back end service, application layer, and even an entire linux utility appFor more information see the documentation page [PolyPacket](https://mrt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/polypacket/polypacket.html)</longdescription>
