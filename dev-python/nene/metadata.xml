	<longdescription># Nēnē: A no-frills static site generator[![Latest release on PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/nene.svg?style=flat-square)][pypi][![Latest release on conda-forge](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/nene.svg?style=flat-square)][conda-forge][![Compatible Python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/nene.svg?style=flat-square)][pypi]&gt; Do you love &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/getpelican&quot;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;?&gt; Can't get enough of that &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;?&gt; Then Nēnē is probably not for you.Static website generators seem to be the favourite pastime of developersprocrastinating on other more important projects.So of course, I had to make my own!When I say *no-frills*, I mean it. Nēnē has no built-in templates, no specialprovisions for blogging, plugins, or the sort of thing that would be useful ifyou just want to start a website.But it also tries to combine several nice features from other generators intosomething that will appeal to those who want to build their own templates.&gt; **Trivia:** *Nēnē* continues the long tradition of naming static site&gt; generators built in Python after birds (the nēnē is a&gt; [goose endemic to Hawai'i][nene-goose]).## DocumentationInstall instructions and other information can be found in the preliminarydocumentation website (built with Nēnē, of course):[nene.leouieda.com](https://nene.leouieda.com)Looking for an example?
