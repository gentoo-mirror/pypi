	<longdescription>**Pyspng** is a small library to for efficiently loading PNG files to numpy arrays.Pyspng does not offer any image manipulation functionality.Pyspng was originally written to speed up loading uncompressed (PNG compression level 0),making the PNG file format more suitable to be used in machine learning datasets.  Pyspnguses the native [libspng](https://github.com/randy408/libspng) library for fast PNGdecoding.  Synthetic benchmarks indicate pyspng to be roughly 2-3x faster inloading uncompressed PNGs than the Python Pillow library.## Example```import numpy as npimport pyspngwith open('test.png', 'rb') as fin:    nparr = pyspng.load(fin.read())```## Installation```pip install pyspng```Note: binary wheels are built for Linux and Windows.  MacOS may not work out of the box.## Licensepyspng is provided under a BSD-style license that can be found in the LICENSEfile.
