	<longdescription># Python API for NebulonThis is an API client for Nebulon ON for Python 3 and allows working withNebulon nPods just like with the Nebulon ON web user interface but in ascriptable form.## InstallationThe Nebulon Python SDK client is available through the Python Package Indexwith the name nebpyclient, but can also be installed from source.**IMPORTANT**: Please review the changelog to transition from version 1.x of thenebpyclient to version 2.x.### Python Package Index```bashpip install nebpyclient```Or```bashpython3 -m pip install nebpyclient```### Installation from Source Code```bashmkdir nebuloncd nebulongit clone https://github.com/nebulon/nebpyclient.gitcd nebpyclientpython3 setup.py install```To build the HTML documentation from source:```bashcd docs/make html```## Using the APITo use this API, instantiate a `NebPyClient` object with username and password.You can then use its methods to query state, and if a nPod is reachable fromwhere the script is being run modify the system. A simple script to displaythe names of all of the pods in your organization along with a count ofthe volumes in them would be:```pythonfrom nebpyclient import NebPyClientclient = NebPyClient(&quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)npod_list = client.get_npods()for npod in npod_list.items:    print(f&quot;nPod {npod.name} has {npod.volume_count} volumes&quot;)```An example to create a 2 TiB volume called `volume name` on an existing nPodwith the name `NPod Name` would be:```pythonfrom nebpyclient import NebPyClientfrom nebpyclient import NPodFilter, StringFilterclient = NebPyClient(&quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)# find the nPod by namenpod_list = client.get_npods(    npod_filter=NPodFilter(        name=StringFilter(            equals=&quot;NPod Name&quot;               )       ))if npod_list.filtered_count == 0:    # nPod with the name &quot;NPod Name&quot; not found    exit(-1)npod_uuid = npod_list.items[0].uuidvolume_name=&quot;volume name&quot;volume_size_bytes = 2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 # 2 TiB# create the volumeclient.create_volume(    name=volume_name,    size_bytes=volume_size_bytes,    npod_uuid=npod_uuid)```Full documentation on the API is available in the `docs` directory.Some functions have comments that describe functions and methods and arevisible in modern Python IDEs.Please review the[current version of the documentation](https://nebulon.github.io/nebpyclient/index.html)for more details.</longdescription>
