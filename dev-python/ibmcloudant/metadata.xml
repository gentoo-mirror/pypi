We do consider thislibrary production-ready and capable, but there are still somelimitations we’re working to resolve, and refinements we want todeliver. We are working really hard to minimise the disruption fromnow until the 1.0 release, but there may still be some changes thatimpact applications using this SDK. For now, be sure to pin versionsto avoid surprises.&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;!--  The TOC below is generated using the `markdown-toc` node package.      https://github.com/jonschlinkert/markdown-toc      npx markdown-toc -i README.md  --&gt;&lt;!-- toc --&gt;- [Overview](#overview)- [Features](#features)- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)- [Installation](#installation)- [Using the SDK](#using-the-sdk)  * [Authentication](#authentication)    + [Authentication with environment variables](#authentication-with-environment-variables)      - [IAM API key authentication](#iam-api-key-authentication)      - [IAM Trusted profile (container) authentication](#iam-trusted-profile-container-authentication)      - [IAM Trusted profile (VPC) authentication](#iam-trusted-profile-vpc-authentication)      - [Session cookie authentication](#session-cookie-authentication)    + [Authentication with external configuration](#authentication-with-external-configuration)    + [Programmatic authentication](#programmatic-authentication)  * [Request timeout configuration](#request-timeout-configuration)  * [Code examples](#code-examples)    + [1.

As [environment variables](#authentication-with-environment-variables)1. The [programmatic approach](#programmatic-authentication)1. With an [external credentials file](#authentication-with-external-configuration)The following section describes the different authentication types and provides environment variable examples.Examples for other configuration methods are available by following the provided links.### Authentication[service-credentials]: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-locating-your-service-credentials[cloud-IAM-mgmt]: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-managing-access-for-cloudant#introduction-iam-ai[couch-cookie-auth]: https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/server/authn.html#cookie-authentication[cloudant-cookie-auth]: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-work-with-your-account#cookie-authentication[couch-basic-auth]: https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/server/authn.html#basic-authentication[couch-jwt-auth]: https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/server/authn.html#jwt-authentication[cloudant-basic-auth]: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-work-with-your-account#basic-authentication[cloudant-legacy-api-keys]: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-work-with-your-account#api-keys[core-container-auth]: https://github.com/IBM/python-sdk-core/blob/main/Authentication.md#container-authentication[core-vpc-auth]: https://github.com/IBM/python-sdk-core/blob/main/Authentication.md#vpc-instance-authentication[core-iam-auth]: https://github.com/IBM/python-sdk-core/blob/main/Authentication.md#identity-and-access-management-iam-authentication[core-bearer-auth]: https://github.com/IBM/python-sdk-core/blob/main/Authentication.md#bearer-token-authentication[core-basic-auth]: https://github.com/IBM/python-sdk-core/blob/main/Authentication.md#basic-authentication[core-no-auth]: https://github.com/IBM/python-sdk-core/blob/main/Authentication.md#no-auth-authenticationThis library requires credentials to authenticate with IBM Cloudant. These credentials may be:* IBM Cloud IAM credentials (can be used with authentication types `CONTAINER`, `VPC` and `IAM`)    * [IBM Cloud account][cloud-IAM-mgmt] user, service ID or trusted profile credentials      that have been granted access to the IBM Cloud Cloudant resource instance.    * [IBM Cloudant service credentials][service-credentials] generated by the IBM Cloud Cloudant resource instance.* Username and password credentials (can be used with authentication types `COUCHDB_SESSION` and `BASIC`)    * [IBM Cloudant service credentials][service-credentials] generated for an IBM Cloud Cloudant resource instance not configured as `IAM only`.    * IBM Cloudant [legacy credentials][cloudant-basic-auth] (i.e. username and password) for instances not in IBM Cloud.    * IBM Cloudant [legacy API keys][cloudant-legacy-api-keys].For other compatible APIs that are not Cloudant accounts (e.g. Apache CouchDB) non-IAM based authentication typesmust be used.This table summarizes the available authentication types.The authentication types are listed in order of recommendation, preferably use the authentication typefrom the first row in the table that is compatible with your environment.| Authentication type | Recommended for | `AUTH_TYPE` | Description || --- | --- | --- | --- || IAM Trusted Profiles compute resource ([container][core-container-auth]) | Cloudant&lt;BR&gt;(SDK running in IBM Cloud IKS) | `CONTAINER` | Obtains a compute resource (CR) token from the container.&lt;BR&gt;Exchanges the CR token for an IAM `access_token`.&lt;BR&gt;Adds an `Authorization: Bearer &lt;access_token&gt;` header to each HTTP request.&lt;BR&gt;Automatically renews the access token when needed. || IAM Trusted Profiles compute resource ([VPC][core-vpc-auth]) | Cloudant&lt;BR&gt;(SDK running in IBM Cloud VPC) | `VPC` | Obtains an identity token from the VPC instance metadata.&lt;BR&gt;Exchanges the identity token for an IAM `access_token`.&lt;BR&gt;Adds an `Authorization: Bearer &lt;access_token&gt;` header to each HTTP request.&lt;BR&gt;Automatically renews the access token when needed. || [IAM API key][core-iam-auth] | Cloudant | `IAM` | Exchanges an IAM API key for an IAM `access_token`.&lt;BR&gt;Adds an `Authorization: Bearer &lt;access_token&gt;` header to each HTTP request.&lt;BR&gt;Automatically renews the access token when needed. | | [Session cookie](#session-cookie-authentication) | [Cloudant][cloudant-cookie-auth]&lt;BR&gt;(legacy credentials &amp; instances without IAM)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;[Apache CouchDB][couch-cookie-auth] | `COUCHDB_SESSION` | Exchanges credentials with `/_session` endpoint to retrieve a cookie.&lt;BR&gt;Adds `Cookie` header and content to each HTTP request.&lt;BR&gt;Automatically renews session when needed. || [Bearer token][core-bearer-auth] | [Apache CouchDB][couch-jwt-auth]&lt;BR&gt;(using JWT authentication) | `BEARERTOKEN` | Adds an `Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt;` to each HTTP request.&lt;BR&gt;No token management or renewal.&lt;BR&gt;Also compatible with IAM access tokens managed independently of the SDK. || [Basic][core-basic-auth] | [Apache CouchDB][couch-basic-auth]&lt;BR&gt;(if cookies are not enabled) | `BASIC` | Adds an `Authorization: Basic &lt;encoded username and password&gt;` header to each HTTP request. || [None][core-no-auth] | - | `NOAUTH` | Note that this authentication type only works for operations against a database allowing access for unauthenticated users. |The default authentication type for the SDK is `CONTAINER` unless `APIKEY` configuration is supplied, which changes the default authentication type to `IAM`.#### Authentication with environment variablesThe default service name is `CLOUDANT` so `CLOUDANT_` prefixed names are used in these examples.Any custom service name prefix can be used as long as the matching name is used to instantiate the SDK clientand the same prefix is used for all configuration options.##### IAM API key authenticationFor Cloudant *IAM API key authentication*, set the following environmental variables byreplacing the `&lt;url&gt;` and `&lt;apikey&gt;` with your proper[service credentials][service-credentials]. There is no need to set`CLOUDANT_AUTH_TYPE` to `IAM` because it is the default when an `APIKEY` is set.```bashCLOUDANT_URL=&lt;url&gt;CLOUDANT_APIKEY=&lt;apikey&gt;```##### IAM Trusted profile (container) authenticationFor Cloudant *IAM Trusted profile compute resource container authentication*, set the following environmental variables byreplacing the `&lt;url&gt;` and `&lt;id&gt;` with your values. There is no need to set`CLOUDANT_AUTH_TYPE` to `CONTAINER` because it is the default.```bashCLOUDANT_URL=&lt;url&gt;CLOUDANT_IAM_PROFILE_ID=&lt;id&gt;```Alternatively a profile name may be used instead of an ID by replacing `CLOUDANT_IAM_PROFILE_ID` with `CLOUDANT_IAM_PROFILE_NAME`.##### IAM Trusted profile (VPC) authenticationFor Cloudant *IAM Trusted profile compute resource vpc authentication*, set the following environmental variables byreplacing the `&lt;url&gt;` and `&lt;id&gt;` with your values.```bashCLOUDANT_AUTH_TYPE=VPCCLOUDANT_URL=&lt;url&gt;CLOUDANT_IAM_PROFILE_ID=&lt;id&gt;```Alternatively a profile CRN may be used instead of an ID by replacing `CLOUDANT_IAM_PROFILE_ID` with `CLOUDANT_IAM_PROFILE_CRN`.##### Session cookie authenticationFor `COUCHDB_SESSION` authentication, set the following environmental variablesby replacing the `&lt;url&gt;`, `&lt;username&gt;` and `&lt;password&gt;` with your proper[service credentials][service-credentials].```bashCLOUDANT_AUTH_TYPE=COUCHDB_SESSIONCLOUDANT_URL=&lt;url&gt;CLOUDANT_USERNAME=&lt;username&gt;CLOUDANT_PASSWORD=&lt;password&gt;```#### Authentication with external configurationTo use an external configuration file, the[Cloudant API docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=python#authentication-with-external-configuration),or the[general SDK usage information](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cloud-sdk-common#using-external-configuration)will guide you.#### Programmatic authenticationTo learn more about how to use programmatic authentication, see the relateddocumentation in the[Cloudant API docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=python#programmatic-authentication)or in the[Python SDK Core document](https://github.com/IBM/python-sdk-core/blob/main/Authentication.md) about authentication.### Request timeout configurationNo request timeout is defined, but a 2.5m read and a 60s connect timeout are set by default. Be sure to set a request timeout appropriate to your application usage and environment.The [request timeout](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cloud-sdk-common/blob/main/README.md) section contains details on how to change the value.**Note:** System settings may take precedence over configured timeout values.### Code examplesThe following code examples[authenticate with the environment variables](#authentication-with-environment-variables).#### 1. Create a database and add a document**Note:** This example code assumes that `orders` database does not exist in your account.This example code creates `orders` database and adds a new document &quot;example&quot;into it. To connect, you must set your environment variables withthe *service url*, *authentication type* and *authentication credentials*of your Cloudant service.Cloudant environment variable naming starts with a *service name* prefix that identifies your service.By default, this is `CLOUDANT`, see the settings in the[authentication with environment variables section](#authentication-with-environment-variables).If you would like to rename your Cloudant service from `CLOUDANT`,you must use your defined service name as the prefix for all Cloudant related environment variables.Once the environment variables are set, you can try out the code examples.[embedmd]:# (test/examples/src/create_db_and_doc.py /from ibm_cloud_sdk_core import/ $)```pyfrom ibm_cloud_sdk_core import ApiExceptionfrom ibmcloudant.cloudant_v1 import CloudantV1, Document# 1.

One approach uses only model classes and the other only dictionaries.&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Example using model class structure&lt;/summary&gt;[embedmd]:# (test/examples/src/model_vs_dict/put_ddoc_class.py /from/ $)```pyfrom ibmcloudant.cloudant_v1 import DesignDocument, CloudantV1, DesignDocumentOptions, SearchIndexDefinitionclient = CloudantV1.new_instance()price_index = SearchIndexDefinition(    index='function (doc) { index(&quot;price&quot;, doc.price); }')design_document_options = DesignDocumentOptions(    partitioned=True)partitioned_design_doc = DesignDocument(    indexes={'findByPrice': price_index},    options=design_document_options)response = client.put_design_document(    db='products',    design_document=partitioned_design_doc,    ddoc='appliances').get_result()print(response)```&lt;/details&gt;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Same example using dictionary structure&lt;/summary&gt;[embedmd]:# (test/examples/src/model_vs_dict/put_ddoc_dict.py /from/ $)```pyfrom ibmcloudant.cloudant_v1 import CloudantV1client = CloudantV1.new_instance()price_index = {    'index': 'function (doc) { index(&quot;price&quot;, doc.price); }'}partitioned_design_doc = {    'indexes': {'findByPrice': price_index},    'options': {'partitioned': True},}response = client.put_design_document(    db='products',    design_document=partitioned_design_doc,    ddoc='appliances').get_result()print(response)```&lt;/details&gt;Since model classes and dicts are different data structures, they cannot be combined.&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;This solution will be invalid&lt;/summary&gt;[embedmd]:# (test/examples/src/model_vs_dict/put_ddoc_invalid.py /from/ $)```pyfrom ibmcloudant.cloudant_v1 import CloudantV1, DesignDocumentclient = CloudantV1.new_instance()price_index = {    'index': 'function (doc) { index(&quot;price&quot;, doc.price); }'}partitioned_design_doc = DesignDocument(    indexes={'findByPrice': price_index},    options={'partitioned': True})response = client.put_design_document(    db='products',    design_document=partitioned_design_doc,    ddoc='appliances').get_result()print(response)```&lt;/details&gt;### Further resources- [Cloudant API docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=python):  API reference including usage examples for Cloudant Python SDK API.- [Pydoc](https://ibm.github.io/cloudant-python-sdk/):  Cloudant Python SDK API Documentation.- [Cloudant docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-getting-started-with-cloudant):  The official documentation page for Cloudant.- [Cloudant blog](https://blog.cloudant.com/):  Many useful articles about how to optimize Cloudant for common problems.### Changes feed follower (beta)#### IntroductionThe SDK provides a changes feed follower utility (currently beta).This helper utility connects to the `_changes` endpoint and returns the individual change items.It removes some of the complexity of using the `_changes` endpoint by setting some options automaticallyand providing error suppression and retries.*Tip: the changes feed often does not meet user expectations or assumptions.*Consult the [Cloudant changes feed FAQ](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-changes-feed)to get a better understanding of the limitations and suitable use-cases before using the changes feed in your application.#### Modes of operationThere are two modes of operation:* Start mode    * Fetches the changes from the supplied `since` sequence (by default the feed will start from `now`).    * Fetches all available changes and then continues listening for new changes indefinitely unless encountering an end condition.    * An example use case for this mode is event driven workloads.* Start one-off mode    * Fetches the changes from the supplied `since` sequence (by default the feed will start from the beginning).    * Fetches all available changes and then stops when either there are no further changes pending or encountering an end condition.    * An example use case for this mode is ETL style workloads.#### Configuring the changes followerThe SDK's model of changes feed options is also used to configure the follower.However, a subset of the options are invalid as they are configured internally by the implementation.Supplying these options when instantiating the follower causes an error.The invalid options are:* `descending`* `feed`* `heartbeat`* `lastEventId` - use `since` instead* `timeout`* Only the value of `_selector` is permitted for the `filter` option. This restriction is because selector  based filters perform better than JavaScript backed filters. Configuring a non-selector based filter will  cause the follower to error.Note that the `limit` parameter will terminate the follower at the given number of changes in eitheroperating mode.The changes follower requires the client to have HTTP timeouts of at least 1 minute and will error duringinstantiation if it is insufficient. The default client configuration has sufficiently long timeouts.For use-cases where these configuration limitations are deemed too restrictive then it is recommended towrite code to use the SDK's [POST `_changes` API](https://github.com/IBM/cloudant-python-sdk/tree/v0.6.0/examples#postchanges) instead of the follower.#### Error suppressionBy default, the changes follower will suppress transient errors indefinitely and attempt to run to completion or listen forever asdictated by the operating mode.For applications where that is not desirable an optional error tolerance duration may be specified to control the time sincethe last successful response that transient errors will be suppressed. This can be used, for example,  by applications as a grace periodbefore reporting an error and requiring intervention.There are some additional points to consider for error suppression:* Errors considered terminal, for example, the database not existing or invalid credentials are never suppressed and will error immediately.* The error suppression duration is not guaranteed to fire immediately after lapsing and should be considered a minimum suppression time.* The changes follower will back-off between retries and as such may remain paused for a short while after the transient errors have resolved.* If the underlying SDK client used to initialize the follower also has retries configured then errors could be suppressed for significantly  longer than the follower's configured error tolerance duration depending on the configuration options.#### Follower operationFor both modes:* The end conditions are:    * A terminal error (HTTP codes `400`, `401`, `403` `404`).    * Transient errors occur for longer than the error tolerance duration. Transient errors are all other HTTP status codes and connection errors.    * The number of changes received reaches the configured `limit`.    * The feed is terminated early by calling stop.As is true for the `_changes` endpoint change items have _at least once_ delivery and an individual itemmay be received multiple times. When using the follower change items may be repeated even within a limitednumber of changes (i.e. using the `limit` option) this is a minor difference from using `limit` on the HTTP native API.The follower is not optimized for some use cases and it is not recommended to use it in cases where:* Setting `include_docs` and larger document sizes (for example &gt; 10 kiB).* The volume of changes is very high (if the rate of changes in the database exceeds the follower's rate of pulling them it will never catch-up).In these cases use-case specific control over the number of change requests made and the content size of the responsesmay be achieved by using the SDK's [POST `_changes` API](https://github.com/IBM/cloudant-python-sdk/tree/v0.6.0/examples#postchanges).#### CheckpointingThe changes follower does not checkpoint since it has no information about whether a change item has beenprocessed by the consuming application after being received. It is the application developer's responsibilityto store the sequence IDs to have appropriate checkpoints and to re-initialize the follower with the required`since` value after, for example, the application restarts.The frequency and conditions for checkpointing are application specific and some applications may be tolerantof dropped changes. This section is intended only to provide general guidance on how to avoid missing changes.To guarantee processing of all changes the sequence ID from a change item must not be persisted until _after_the processing of the change item by the application has completed. As indicated previously change items aredelivered _at least once_ so application code must be able to handle repeated changes already and it ispreferable to restart from an older `since` value and receive changes again than risk missing them.The sequence IDs are available on each change item by default, but may be omitted from some change items whenusing the `seq_interval` configuration option. Infrequent sequence IDs may improve performance by reducingthe amount of data that needs to be transferred, but the trade-off is that more changes will be repeated ifit is necessary to resume the changes follower.Extreme care should be taken with persisting sequences if choosing to process change items in parallel as thereis a considerable risk of missing changes on a restart if the sequence is recorded out of order.#### Code examples##### Initializing a changes follower[embedmd]:# (test/examples/src/features/initialize.py /import/ $)```pyimport ChangesFollowerfrom ibmcloudant.cloudant_v1 import CloudantV1client = CloudantV1.new_instance()cf_params = {    'db': 'example',  # Required: the database name.
