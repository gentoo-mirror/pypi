Then run setup.py to install.Alternatively, install from Pypi with 'pip install fixate'### Run the example scriptsThere are a number of examples under src/fixate/examples. For a minimal example try running tiny.py.For a more complicated example using multi-level tests, try running multi_level_design.py.The test runner is executed by calling the package as a script with the test script to execute passed in using the'-p' command line argument, as well as the -c command line argument to specify the config file#### Running on Windows:If running from a pip installed version of fixate the path to the examples will be &quot;path_to_python_installation&quot;/Lib/site-packages/fixate/examples/ From this folder the following can be executed:python -m fixate -p tiny.pyAlternatively the full path to tiny.py can be provided.python -m fixate -p &quot;path_to_python_installation&quot;/Lib/site-packages/fixate/examples/tiny.py#### Running on MacOS:Running on Mac is the same as running on Windows with the exception of the path to the examples. The path will be: &quot;path_to_python_installation&quot;/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/fixate/examples/Where X.Y is the version of python that is installed.## Running the testsIn general, it is recommended to run the &quot;core&quot; set of tests.The &quot;drivers&quot; test have a number of dependencies that are not required by default. Tests run using unittest.Navigate to the test/core directory and execute &quot;python -m unittest&quot;.## Modifying the Qt GUIThe Qt GUI base file is created using Qt Designer under Mingw32.If you'd like to make changes, use pyuic5 to build the layout file, with the command:pyuic5 fixateGUI.ui -o layout.py## Check out the docshttps://fixate.readthedocs.io## ContributingContributions are welcome.
