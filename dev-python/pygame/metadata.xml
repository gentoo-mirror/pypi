Pygame comes with many tutorials andintroductions.  There is also full reference documentation for theentire library. Browse the documentation on the `docs page`_. Youcan also browse the documentation locally by running``python -m pygame.docs`` in your terminal. If the docs aren't foundlocally, it'll launch the online website instead.The online documentation stays up to date with the development versionof pygame on github.  This may be a bit newer than the version of pygameyou are using. To upgrade to the latest full release, run ``pip install pygame --upgrade`` in your terminal.Best of all, the examples directory has many playable small programswhich can get you started playing with the code right away.Pygame is a powerful library for game development, offering a wide range of features to simplify your coding journey. Let's delve into what Pygame has to offer:Graphics: With Pygame, creating dynamic and engaging graphics has never been easier. The library provides simple yet effective tools for2D graphics and animation, including support for images, rectangles, and polygon shapes. Whether you're a seasoned game developer or juststarting out, Pygame has you covered.Sound: Pygame also includes support for playing and manipulating sound and music, making it easy to add sound effects and background music toyour games. With support for WAV, MP3, and OGG file formats, you have plenty of options to choose from.Input: Pygame provides intuitive functions for handling keyboard, mouse,and joystick input, allowing you to quickly and easily implement playercontrols in your games. No more struggling with complex input code, Pygamemakes it simple.Game Development: Lastly, Pygame provides a comprehensive suite of toolsand features specifically designed for game development. From collision detection to sprite management, Pygame has everything you need to createexciting and engaging games. Whether you're building a platformer, puzzlegame, or anything in between, Pygame has you covered.Building From Source--------------------If you want to use features that are currently in development,or you want to contribute to pygame, you will need to build pygamelocally from its source code, rather than pip installing it.Installing from source is fairly automated. The most work willinvolve compiling and installing all the pygame dependencies.  Oncethat is done, run the ``setup.py`` script which will attempt toauto-configure, build, and install pygame.Much more information about installing and compiling is availableon the `Compilation wiki page`_.Contribute----------| Thank you for thinking of contributing!|| To contribute to the main `project documentation &lt;https://www.pygame.org/docs/&gt;`_, see ``docs/README.md`` or view more detailed instructions `here &lt;https://github.com/pygame/pygame/tree/main/docs&gt;`_.|| New to contributing to Open Source Free Libre software? | There is a draft of `&quot;Let's write a unit test!&quot; &lt;http://renesd.blogspot.com/2019/11/draft-2-of-lets-write-unit-test.html&gt;`_ which is a step by step guide on how to write your first unit test in python for pygame, which is very similar to how you would do it for other projects. || Want or need to compile pygame from source?| `See the compilation page &lt;https://www.pygame.org/wiki/Compilation&gt;`_ for more detailed instructions.|| For a detailed developer guide on &quot;How to Hack Pygame&quot;:| Head to the `Hacking Page &lt;https://www.pygame.org/wiki/Hacking&gt;`_.|| Beginner developers looking for ways to contribute to the project can look at issues labeled `&quot;good first issue&quot; &lt;https://github.com/pygame/pygame/labels/good%20first%20issue&gt;`_ or `&quot;Difficulty: Easy&quot; &lt;https://github.com/pygame/pygame/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Difficulty%3A+Easy%22&gt;`_. || To submit patches and report bugs:| Visit the `Bugs &amp; Patches &lt;https://www.pygame.org/wiki/patchesandbugs&gt;`_ page for detailed instructions.| | `See the info page &lt;https://www.pygame.org/wiki/info&gt;`_ for more info and ways to get in touch with the Pygame team.Credits-------Thanks to everyone who has helped contribute to this library.Special thanks are also in order.* Marcus Von Appen: many changes, and fixes, 1.7.1+ freebsd maintainer* Lenard Lindstrom: the 1.8+ windows maintainer, many changes, and fixes* Brian Fisher for svn auto builder, bug tracker and many contributions* Rene Dudfield: many changes, and fixes, 1.7+ release manager/maintainer* Phil Hassey for his work on the pygame.org website* DR0ID for his work on the sprite module* Richard Goedeken for his smoothscale function* Ulf Ekstr√∂m for his pixel perfect collision detection code* Pete Shinners: original author* David Clark for filling the right-hand-man position* Ed Boraas and Francis Irving: Debian packages* Maxim Sobolev: FreeBSD packaging* Bob Ippolito: MacOS and OS X porting (much work!)* Jan Ekhol, Ray Kelm, and Peter Nicolai: putting up with early design ideas* Nat Pryce for starting our unit tests* Dan Richter for documentation work* TheCorruptor for his incredible logos and graphics* Nicholas Dudfield: many test improvements* Alex Folkner for pygame-ctypesThanks to those sending in patches and fixes: Niki Spahiev, GordonTyler, Nathaniel Pryce, Dave Wallace, John Popplewell, Michael Urman,Andrew Straw, Michael Hudson, Ole Martin Bjoerndalen, Herve Cauwelier,James Mazer, Lalo Martins, Timothy Stranex, Chad Lester, MatthiasSpiller, Bo Jangeborg, Dmitry Borisov, Campbell Barton, Diego Essaya,Eyal Lotem, Regis Desgroppes, Emmanuel Hainry, Randy KaelberMatthew L Daniel, Nirav Patel, Forrest Voight, Charlie Nolan,Frankie Robertson, John Krukoff, Lorenz Quack, Nick Irvine,Michael George, Saul Spatz, Thomas Ibbotson, Tom Rothamel, Evan Kroske,Cambell Barton.And our bug hunters above and beyond: Angus, Guillaume Proux, FrankRaiser, Austin Henry, Kaweh Kazemi, Arturo Aldama, Mike Mulcheck,Michael Benfield, David LauThere's many more folks out there who've submitted helpful ideas, keptthis project going, and basically made our life easier.

It alsolinks to and embeds several other smaller libraries.  The fontmodule relies on SDL_ttf, which is dependent on freetype.  The mixer(and mixer.music) modules depend on SDL_mixer.  The image moduledepends on SDL_image, which also can use libjpeg and libpng.  Thetransform module has an embedded version of SDL_rotozoom for itsown rotozoom function.  The surfarray module requires the PythonNumPy package for its multidimensional numeric arrays.Dependency versions:+----------+------------------------+| CPython  | &gt;= 3.6 (Or use PyPy3)  |+----------+------------------------+| SDL      | &gt;= 2.0.8               |+----------+------------------------+| SDL_mixer| &gt;= 2.0.0               |+----------+------------------------+| SDL_image| &gt;= 2.0.2               |+----------+------------------------+| SDL_ttf  | &gt;= 2.0.11              |+----------+------------------------+| SDL_gfx  | (Optional, vendored in)|+----------+------------------------+| NumPy    | &gt;= 1.6.2 (Optional)    |+----------+------------------------+License-------This library is distributed under `GNU LGPL version 2.1`_, which canbe found in the file ``docs/LGPL.txt``.  We reserve the right to placefuture versions of this library under a different license.This basically means you can use pygame in any project you want,but if you make any changes or additions to pygame itself, thosemust be released with a compatible license (preferably submittedback to the pygame project).  Closed source and commercial games are fine.The programs in the ``examples`` subdirectory are in the public domain.See docs/licenses for licenses of dependencies... |AppVeyorBuild| image:: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/x4074ybuobsh4myx?svg=true   :target: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pygame/pygame.. |PyPiVersion| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pygame.svg?v=1   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygame.. |PyPiLicense| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/pygame.svg?v=1   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygame.. |Python3| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3-blue.svg?v=1.. |GithubCommits| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/pygame/pygame/2.1.2.svg   :target: https://github.com/pygame/pygame/compare/2.1.2...main.. |BlackFormatBadge| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg    :target: https://github.com/psf/black.. _pygame: https://www.pygame.org.. _Simple DirectMedia Layer library: https://www.libsdl.org.. _We need your help: https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html.. _Compilation wiki page: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/Compilation.. _docs page: https://www.pygame.org/docs/.. _GNU LGPL version 2.1: https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html</longdescription>
