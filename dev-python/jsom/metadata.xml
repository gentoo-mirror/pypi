	<longdescription># JSOM - not quite JSON, but close enough`jsom` is a simple and quick Python 3.7+ parser for terribly broken JSON.## Installation`$ pip install jsom`## Usage`jsom` works like this:```python&gt;&gt;&gt; import jsom&gt;&gt;&gt; broken_json = &quot;{\&quot;foo\&quot;: {bar: 1, 'baz':,}, bar: 1, baz: [1,2,3,],}&quot;)&gt;&gt;&gt; jsom.JsomParser(ignore_warnings=jsom.ALL_WARNINGS).loads(broken_json){'foo': {'bar': 1, 'baz': None}, 'bar': 1, 'baz': [1, 2, 3]}````jsom` happily gobbles up the following:* unquoted keys and values* single-quoted strings* trailing commas* empty values in objectsBy default, it will warn you whenever it sees one of those, but still parse it.It also doesn't give a shit about:* Newlines in strings* Stray backslashesYou will never get warned about those. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯Warnings are annoying, though, and to make matters worse, they slow the parser down - so just pass in the list of warnings you want `jsom` to be quietabout in the `ignore_warnings` parameter:```parser = JsomParser(    ignore_warnings=[jsom.SINGLE_QUOTED_STRING, jsom.EMPTY_OBJECT_VALUE])```Or, if you prefer, just tell it to shut up completely, by passing in `jsom.ALL_WARNINGS`.## LICENSE`jsom` is distributed under the terms of the **Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License (WTFPL)**:```        DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE                     Version 2, December 2004  Copyright (C) 2004 Sam Hocevar &lt;sam@hocevar.net&gt;  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified  copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long  as the name is changed.
