	<longdescription># gli_pyA aysnc python 3 API wrapper for GL-inet routers. [WIP][GL-inet](https://www.gl-inet.com/) routers are built on [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/). They are highly customizeable but have an attractive user interface.As part of their modiification of the UI they provide a [locally accessible API](https://dev.gl-inet.com/api).I thought it would be handy to develop a python 3 wrapper for the API for easy intergation into other services such as [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)## Installation`pip3 install gli-py`## Dev setup1. Clone the repo2. Ensure you have python 3 installed `python3 -V` or `python -V`3. Uses poetry for venv control `pip3 install poetry`4. `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true` create the venvs in the project folder5. `poetry install`6. `poetry shell`7. To run tests, ensure there is a file called `router_pwd` in the root directory with the router password in.8. Then run `pytest -s` to see responses, assumes the router is at `192.168.0.1`9. Set token with `poetry config pypi-token.pypi TOKEN`10. publish with `poetry publish`Todo list:- [ ] Decide on useful endpoints to expose - see https://github.com/HarvsG/ha-glinet-integration#todo- [ ] Expose said endpoints- [ ] Write remaining- [x] Package correctly- [x] Test that dev enviroment is re-producable- [x] Publish on pip- [ ] Static typing</longdescription>
