This should hopefully be the case on most *nix systems, in whichcase, the following ought to work::    pip install batoidGithub------If PyPI doesn't work, then you can try cloning the source from github andrunning setup.py.  Clone the repo with either ::    git clone git@github.com:jmeyers314/batoid.gitor ::    git clone https://github.com/jmeyers314/batoid.gitOnce the repo has been cloned, then compile and install with ::    python setup.py installor optionally ::    python setup.py install --userTests=====To run the unit tests, from the batoid directory, first install the testingrequirements ::    pip install -r test_requirements.txtAnd then run the tests using pytest ::    pytest</longdescription>
