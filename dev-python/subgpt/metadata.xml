	<longdescription>SubGPT takes subdomains you have already discovered for a target and uses BingGPT to predict what other subdomains are likely to exists. It's free as it uses Microsoft Bing.Like the tool? Support my work for as little as $1, [here](https://github.com/sponsors/s0md3v) :\)### Install &amp; Configuration#### Installation- with pip (recommended): `pip install subgpt`- from github: `git clone https://github.com/s0md3v/SubGPT &amp;&amp; cd SubGPT &amp;&amp; python setup.py install`#### Getting Bing Cookie1. Install 2. Visit bing.com3. Open the extension and copy your cookies using the &quot;export&quot; button4. Paste it in a file e.g. `cookies.json`5. Done. Now you can&gt; Note: Any issues regarding BingGPT itself should be reported [EdgeGPT](https://github.com/acheong08/EdgeGPT), not here.### Using SubGPT#### Find Subdomains```subgpt -i input.txt -o output.txt -c /path/to/cookies.json```#### Generate SubdomainsIf you just want to generate subdomains and not resolve them, use this option:```subgpt -i input.txt -o output.txt -c /path/to/cookies.json --dont-resolve```#### Important1. Sometimes your cookie will expire if you visit bing.com. In that case, just export it again.2. Make sure your subdomains list only has subdomains from one domain.3. SubGPT looks at A/CNAME records to determine whether a subdomain exists. It can also detect wildcard on first-level subdomains and handle it automatically. You can go through the code to see how its implemented if it concerns you.4. It can't replace traditional sub-generators like [gotator](https://github.com/Josue87/gotator), [alterx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/alterx), [dnsgen](https://github.com/ProjectAnte/dnsgen) etc. However, being powered by AI helps it generate subdomains that may not exist.</longdescription>
