This projects aimsto be a simple way of getting rid of those markups.Limitations-----------template_remover is based on regular expressions. This means that there are someedge cases that cannot be captured with this method. Although we believe thosecases are too contrived, and probably should be avoided as many developmenttools will fail as well.One example that won't work is the following:::  &lt;?php echo &quot;?&gt;&quot; ?&gt;The reason it does not work is because when the method sees the first '?&gt;'(the one inside the string), it thinks it's a closing tag.Example use-----------Below are example of how template_remover.py is used::  $ remove_template.py filename.html  $ remove_template.py filename.html | tidy -qeInstallation------------You can install, upgrade or uninstall template-remover with these commands::  $ pip install template-remover  $ pip install --upgrade template-remover  $ pip uninstall template-removerPython Versions---------------Python 2.7 is officially supported, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 should also work.Development-----------Help for this project is more than welcomed, so feel free to create an issue orto send a pull request via http://github.com/deezer/template-remover.Tests are run using nose, either with::  $ python -R setup.py nosetests  $ nosetestsUse the tool `git-lint &lt;https://github.com/sk-/git-lint&gt;`_ before any commit, soerrors and style problems are caught early.TODOS and Possible Features---------------------------* Support more template engines and languages (Smarty, ASP, JSP, etc).Changelog=========v0.1 (2014-05-07)-------------------* Initial commit.</longdescription>
