The type hint resolver reads those fields -- which themseves are either raw stringsor ASTs.It uses provided Python symbol tables to resolve type hints into actual type objects usingintrospection.By default, the resolver uses only built-in symbols when called directly or through ``augment()``.However, when called through ``parse()`` it uses ``globals()`` and ``locals()`` of the callerby default.The resolved type hints are stored directly in the AST. Specifically, each resolved field is storedin a correspondingly named field, which is either ``resolved_type_comment``, ``resolved_annotation``or ``resolved_returns``.Thus, static type information becomes available in the AST.Type information combining--------------------------For each AST node that might contain any name declarations, an exetended version of a nodeis provided. Each extended AST node has new fields that store those declared names and typeinformation associated with each name.These new fields store all type information from all resolved type hints within any local scope,so that a type conflict or lack of type information can be detected. Also, based on this combinedinformation, type inference can be performed.Specifically, new versions of following AST nodes with new fields are provided: ``Module``,``FunctionDef``, ``ClassDef``, ``Assign``, ``AnnAssign``, ``For`` and ``With``. Those new versionshave their names prefixed ``StaticallyTyped...``.A list of entities for which information is gathered in those new fields follows.For ``Module``:*   defined variables*   defined functions*   defined classesFor ``FunctionDef``:*   parameters and their types*   return types*   kind  (i.e. function, instance method, class method, static method, etc.)*   local variables and their typesFor ``ClassDef``:*   defined methods (all together and grouped by kind)*   class fields and their types*   instance fields and their typesFor ``Assign`` and ``AnnAssign``:*   assignment targets and their typesFor ``For``:*   index variables and their typesFor ``With``:*   context variables and their typesAST rewriting-------------The AST rewriting means replacing ordinary AST nodes listed above with their extended versions.Requirements============Python version 3.5 or later.Python libraries as specified in `requirements.txt &lt;https://github.com/mbdevpl/static-typing/blob/v0.2.7/requirements.txt&gt;`_.Building and running tests additionally requires packages listed in `test_requirements.txt &lt;https://github.com/mbdevpl/static-typing/blob/v0.2.7/test_requirements.txt&gt;`_.Tested on Linux and Windows.</longdescription>
