(SOFT_DELETE_CASCADE) - it can be normally deleted (HARD_DELETE) - it can be hard-deleted, but if its deletion would delete other objects, it will only be masked (HARD_DELETE_NOCASCADE) - it can be never deleted or masked from your database (NO_DELETE, use with caution)Example-------.. code-block:: python    # imports    from safedelete.models import SafeDeleteModel    from safedelete.models import HARD_DELETE_NOCASCADE    # Models    # We create a new model, with the given policy : Objects will be hard-deleted, or soft deleted if other objects would have been deleted too.    class Article(SafeDeleteModel):        _safedelete_policy = HARD_DELETE_NOCASCADE        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)    class Order(SafeDeleteModel):        _safedelete_policy = HARD_DELETE_NOCASCADE        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)        articles = models.ManyToManyField(Article)    # Example of use    &gt;&gt;&gt; article1 = Article(name='article1')    &gt;&gt;&gt; article1.save()    &gt;&gt;&gt; article2 = Article(name='article2')    &gt;&gt;&gt; article2.save()    &gt;&gt;&gt; order = Order(name='order')    &gt;&gt;&gt; order.save()    &gt;&gt;&gt; order.articles.add(article1)    # This article will be masked, but not deleted from the database as it is still referenced in an order.    &gt;&gt;&gt; article1.delete()    # This article will be deleted from the database.    &gt;&gt;&gt; article2.delete()Compatibilities---------------* Branch 0.2.x is compatible with django &gt;= 1.2* Branch 0.3.x is compatible with django &gt;= 1.4* Branch 0.4.x is compatible with django &gt;= 1.8* Branch 0.5.x is compatible with django &gt;= 1.11* Branch 1.0.x, 1.1.x and 1.2.x are compatible with django &gt;= 2.2* Branch 1.3.x is compatible with django &gt;= 3.2 and Python &gt;= 3.7Current branch (1.3.x) is tested with :*  Django 3.2 using python 3.7 to 3.10.*  Django 4.0 using python 3.8 to 3.10.*  Django 4.1 using python 3.8 to 3.10.*  Django 4.2 using python 3.8 to 3.11.Installation------------Installing from pypi (using pip). ::    pip install django-safedeleteInstalling from github. ::    pip install -e git://github.com/makinacorpus/django-safedelete.git#egg=django-safedeleteAdd ``safedelete`` in your ``INSTALLED_APPS``:.. code-block:: python    INSTALLED_APPS = [        'safedelete',        [...]    ]The application doesn't have any special requirement.Configuration-------------In the main django settings you can activate the boolean variable ``SAFE_DELETE_INTERPRET_UNDELETED_OBJECTS_AS_CREATED``.If you do this the ``update_or_create()`` function from django's standard manager class will return ``True`` forthe ``created`` variable if the object was soft-deleted and is now &quot;revived&quot;.By default, the field that indicates a database entry is soft-deleted is ``deleted``, however, you can override the field nameusing the ``SAFE_DELETE_FIELD_NAME`` setting.Documentation-------------The documentation is available `here &lt;http://django-safedelete.readthedocs.org&gt;`_.
