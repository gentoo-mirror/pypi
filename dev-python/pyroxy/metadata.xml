	<longdescription>Background----------Since the beginning of time (the 90s), `PyPI &lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi&gt;`_has stood as the pinnacle of centralized Python packaging.  Everytime an`easy_install` or a `pip` command is run, PyPI is servicing a request, routingyou to the correct version, architecture, etc., of the package you requested.Its very flexible--even allowing package authors to host packages both to PyPI*and* their personal web sites....which is all fine and dandy, until these third-party web sites run intoproblems.  Infinite loops due to randomly generated URLs names causing DDoSattacks, slow download speeds, missing files, and downtime, all affect the enduser's experience.  While `pip` seeks to address some of these issues, theplain and simple fact of the matter is: **PyPI is no longer a reliableresource.**``pyroxy`` is a special kind of proxy that sits between your client and`PyPI &lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi&gt;`_; with it, you can restrict what packagesare available, as well as what sources to use.  For example, the defaultbehavior is to choose PyPI hosted packages, direct download links, or genericURLs (which are then parsed), in that order--if the higher precendence isavailable, the more unreliable are omitted.  With the ability to setwhitelisted packages, this means that you can essentially control what yourclients are accessing at any time!Documentation-------------Documentation can be viewed through PyPI, or by building the documentationyourself using::    python setup.py develop    python setup.py build_sphinxThe latest (and previously published) versions of the documentation `are alwaysavailable on RTD &lt;http://readthedocs.org/docs/pyroxy/en/v0.1/&gt;`_.License-------pyroxy is covered by the APL 2.0 license.  See LICENSE for all details.</longdescription>
