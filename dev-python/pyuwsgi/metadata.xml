	<longdescription># The uWSGI server as a Python module## Install```pip install pyuwsgi```## RunuWSGI will get installed to your Python path with a console script named `pyuwsgi`. Tomake it a full drop-in replacement it will install a script named `uwsgi` as well.You can also call it directly in your Python code with a list of valid uWSGI options:```pythonimport pyuwsgipyuwsgi.run([&quot;--help&quot;])```## Differences from uWSGIThis is built from uWSGI's source without any modifications.A different [`setup.py`](https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi/blob/uwsgi-2.0/setup.pyuwsgi.py)is used to make the project a friendlier part of the Python ecosystem. It allows itto be imported as a Python module and distributed using the[wheel format](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/). The pre-packaged wheelsinclude the following common libraries used by uWSGI:* [zlib](https://zlib.net/)* [pcre](https://www.pcre.org/)* [jansson](http://www.digip.org/jansson/)SSL is intentionally excluded for security reasons. If you need SSL support, you canforce a wheel to be built locally with the `pip` flag `--no-binary=pyuwsgi`.In addition to the default plugins, the [`stats_pusher_statsd`](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Metrics.html#statsd)plugin is included by default in `pyuwsgi` where it is typically optional for uWSGI.The full uWSGI documentation can be found at[https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io).## LicenseuWSGI is licensed [GPLv2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt) witha [linking exception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL_linking_exception) which meansyou are allowed to use uWSGI (or pyuwsgi) unmodified in a proprietary or otherwise non-GPLlicensed project without invoking the GPL on the rest of the code.The [full license](https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi/blob/uwsgi-2.0/LICENSE) can be foundon GitHub.---[![Lincoln Loop](https://cldup.com/gyNz5rfTkR.png)](https://lincolnloop.com)`pyuwsgi` is sponsored by [Lincoln Loop](https://lincolnloop.com).[![Unbit](https://cldup.com/TTNag1Zlcw.png)](http://unbit.com/)`uwsgi` is the creation of [Unbit](http://unbit.com/).</longdescription>
