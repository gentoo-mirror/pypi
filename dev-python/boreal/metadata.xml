The reactive audio widgets can be used as part of astand-alone Bokeh application but the primary goal of the framework isto support the exploratory coding process when using Jupyter notebooksfor audio research.The library is designed to be extensible and supports the addition ofnew audio reactive widgets as well as audio processors that extractinformation from the underlying audio signal. Playback controls can beused to play, pause, and seek the underlying audio and associatedvisuals.Installation------------**Building from source**To build boreal from source try::  python setup.py buildThen to install::    python setup.py installIf all went well, you should be able to run the following command in Python::    import boreal Get started-----------To see how Boreal works try the following notebook (also part of the package):https://github.com/gtzan/boreal/blob/main/boreal/audio_widgets_notebook.ipynbFeatures--------* Bokeh application for audio reactive plots * Example audio widgets: time domain, spectrum, waveform envelope, circularEQ* Support for both real-time computation of visuals as well as pre-computation* Ability to use html audio for playback on a local machine when notebook  is hosted remotely * Straighforward to add new audio widgets and audio processors TODO====Boreal is under development and there is a lot of additinal work planned.Some examples include:*  More audio widgets*  Better documentation*  Support for multi-channel audio   Credits-------This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template... _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage=======History=======0.1.0 (2022-09-22)------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>
