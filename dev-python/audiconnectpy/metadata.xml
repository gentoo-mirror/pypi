It adds presence detection, sensors such as range, mileage, and fuel level, and provides car actions such as locking/unlocking and setting the pre-heater.Note: Certain functions require special permissions from Audi, such as position update via GPS.Credit for initial API discovery go to the guys at the ioBroker VW-Connect forum, who were able to figure out how the API and the PIN hashing works. Also some implementation credit to davidgiga1993 of the original AudiAPI Python package, on which some of this code is loosely based.## WarningUse this API with care. If you use it wrong (e.g. too many logins, repeated login attempts with wrong password, ...) your account may get blocked.## InstallUse the PIP package manager```bashpip install audiconnectpy```Or manually download and install the last version from github```bashgit clone https://github.com/cyr-ius/audiconnectpy.gitpython setup.py install```## Get started```python# Import the audiconnectpy package.from audiconnectpy import AudiConnectasync def main():    async with ClientSession() as session:        api = AudiConnect(session, VW_USERNAME, VW_PASSWORD, COUNTRY, SPIN)        await api.async_update()        print(api.vehicles)if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()    loop.run_until_complete(main())```Have a look at the [example.py](https://github.com/cyr-ius/audiconnectpy/blob/master/example.py) for a more complete overview.## Login &amp; ConsentAudiconectpy is based on the new Carnet ID API that was introduced with the new series of ID cars. If you use another car or hybrid you probably need to agree to the terms and conditions of the My Audi interface. Easiest to do so is by installing the My Audi app on your smartphone and login there. If necessary you will be asked to agree to the terms and conditions.## CreditsInspired by :- [arjenvrh/audi_connect_ha](https://github.com/arjenvrh/audi_connect_ha)- [tknaller/openhab-addons](https://github.com/tknaller/openhab-addons)- [davidgiga1993/AudiAPI](https://github.com/davidgiga1993/AudiAPI)</longdescription>
