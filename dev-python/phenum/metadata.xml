The code uses a newly developed group theoretic approachthat is extremely efficient and can include the enumeration ofdisplacement directions, or arrow directions, within a system.Full API Documentation available at: `githubpages &lt;https://wsmorgan.github.io/phenum/&gt;`__.Installing the code-------------------To install the code use the following command in the phonon-enumerationdirectory:::    pip intsall phenumAlternatively you can clone this repository and use:::    python setup.py installfrom within the phonon-enumeration directory.Running the code----------------Complete enumeration of a system.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~If you want to enumerate every possible structure specified in your'struct\_enum.in' file, a sample of which can be found in the inputfolder, then use the commend:::    enumeration-py -enumEnumerating a subset~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~If the total number of arrangements in your system is huge you may notwant to enumerate them all. In that case it is possible to enumerate asubset of the system as follows. Examples of all input files can befound in the input folder. First have the code find the polyadistribution for the system described in your lattice.in file:::    enumeration.py -polyaNext we need to build an enum.in file. You may either build this by handor have the code build it for you using the ``-distribution`` optionwhich takes two arguments, the type of distribution and the number ofstructures we want in the results.::    enumeration.py -distribution all all    enumeration.py -distribution all 100If any option other than 'all' is passed into the first argument thenthe code will not produce an enum.in file that will be useful for theactual enumeration. The options of 'HNF', 'shape', and 'conc' are simplyfor the user's viewing purposes.Once an enum.in file has been constructed we can enumerate the entireset of unique configurations:::    enumeration.py -enumThis will make an enum.out file listing the unique configurations.Making POSCARS==============Phenum contains a second executable for making POSCARS. To make a POSCARfirst select a structure number, or range of structures, for the POSCARsto be constructed for from the enum.out file. Then run:::    makeStr.py 10This would make the POSCAR for the 10th structure. For a range ofstructures use:::    makeStr.py 20 30To make POSCARs for the 20th to 30th structures. The POSCARS are savedas vasp.\* files. To have the code calculate the lattice parameter aswell use:::    makeStr.py 10 -species Al NiWhere the Al and Ni are replaced with the elements in the system beingmodeled.Visualization=============At times it is useful to construct the distribution based off the shapesof the supercells. For the non-expert user an option has been added tothe code to make pictures of the supercells. To do this first we need tomake a distribution of only the supercells:::    enumeration.py -distribution shape all -savedistThis created an enum.in file that lists only the supercells and thenumber of unique arrangements within each supercell. We can nowvisualize each of the supercells:::    enumeration.py -visualize -shapeThis creates a pdf file for each of the supercells. The ``-shape``option forces the code to include the lines that define the cell in thepdfs.Python Packages Used--------------------The enumeration.py code require the following python packages to run:-  numpy-  pyparsing-  termcolor-  matplotlib.. |PyPI| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/phenum.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/phenum/.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/wsmorgan/phonon-enumeration.svg?branch=master   :target: https://travis-ci.org/wsmorgan/phonon-enumeration.. |codecov| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/wsmorgan/phonon-enumeration/branch/master/graph/badge.svg   :target: https://codecov.io/gh/wsmorgan/phonon-enumeration.. |Code Issues| image:: https://www.quantifiedcode.com/api/v1/project/675d6268247c4c2cb80669f832bef46c/badge.svg   :target: https://www.quantifiedcode.com/app/project/675d6268247c4c2cb80669f832bef46c</longdescription>
