For each set of duplicates, the tool will ask you to enter the number corresponding to the copy you want to keep. Pressing 'enter' without entering a number will skip that set without deleting anything.  -ad, --autodelete     Automatically decide which file to keep and which to delete from each set of duplicate files instead of asking which to keep.  -ns, --no_show        Don't show printout of matching files.&lt;/pre&gt;</longdescription>
