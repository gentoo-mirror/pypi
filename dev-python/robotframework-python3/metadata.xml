	<longdescription>https://github.com/userzimmermann/robotframework/tree/python3- Forked from https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework- Compatible with **Python 2.7**Please report any issues to:https://github.com/userzimmermann/robotframework/issuesYou can look at this URL for a complete code diff:https://github.com/userzimmermann/robotframework/compare/master...python3Installation------------::    pip install robotframework-python3Requirements............* `six &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six&gt;`_Differences in Python 3-----------------------Python 3 makes a clear distinction between *str* for textual dataand *bytes* for binary data.This affects the Standard Test Libraries and their Keywords:- *str* arguments don't work where *bytes* are expected,  like writing to binary file streams or comparing with other *bytes*.- *bytes* don't work where *str* is expected,  like writing to text mode streams or comparing with another *str*.- Reading from binary streams always returns *bytes*.- Reading from text streams always returns *str*.You can use the following keywords to explicitly create *bytes*:- **BuiltIn.Convert To Bytes**- **String.Encode String To Bytes**I extended **Process.Start Process** with a *binary_mode* argument.By default the process streams are opened in text mode.You can change this with::    binary_mode=True**Collections.Get Dictionary Keys** normally sorts the keys.I disabled key sorting in Python 3,because most builtin types are not comparable to each other.This further affects **Get Dictionary Values** and **Get Dictionary Items**.I still need to find a better solution... Maybe imitate Python 2 sorting?Any suggestions? :)</longdescription>
