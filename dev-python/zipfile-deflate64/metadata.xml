This was developed in 2003 by Mark Adler, an original author of zlib, and is kept in the source repositoryof zlib, but it is not officially supported and contains no build tooling and is not distributed with zlib packages.Additionally, infback9 provides only low-level support for working with Deflate64 bitstreams, with no support forthe ZIP archive format (which is out of scope for zlib).infback9's C-language API is relatively simple, but requires a non-trivial struct and function pointers forinitialization and some explicit memory management operations (resizing allocated buffers and proving aPython-friendly `malloc`) to operate efficiently, so wrapping it with only[ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) seems to be inadequate.To manage ZIP archive extraction operations, the Python standard library[zipfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html) module provides the essential features and is alreadyubiquitous in availability and usage. However, zipfile is difficult to extend, as it hardcodes many conditionals forcompression formats and does not provide capabilities for easily augmenting or replacing parts of it. Monkey-patchingcan overcome some of these problems, and the promise of a drop-in, API-compatible patch to a standard library moduleoutweighed the engineering benefits of basing a solution off a more naturally extensible third-party ZIP manipulationpackage.</longdescription>
