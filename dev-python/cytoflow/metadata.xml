	<longdescription>Cytoflow========Python tools for quantitative, reproducible flow cytometry analysis-------------------------------------------------------------------Welcome to a different style of flow cytometry analysis. Take a look atsome example `Jupyter &lt;http://jupyter.org/&gt;`__ notebooks:-  `Basic flow cytometry   analysis &lt;https://github.com/cytoflow/cytoflow/blob/master/docs/examples-basic/Basic%20Cytometry.ipynb&gt;`__-  `An small-molecule induction curve with   yeast &lt;https://github.com/cytoflow/cytoflow/blob/master/docs/examples-basic/Yeast%20Dose%20Response.ipynb&gt;`__-  `Machine learning applied to flow cytometry   data &lt;https://github.com/cytoflow/cytoflow/blob/master/docs/examples-basic/Machine%20Learning.ipynb&gt;`__-  `Reproduced analysis from a published   paper &lt;https://github.com/cytoflow/cytoflow-examples/blob/master/kiani/Kiani%20Nature%20Methods%202014.ipynb&gt;`__-  `A multi-dimensional induction in   yeast &lt;https://github.com/cytoflow/cytoflow-examples/blob/master/yeast/Induction%20Timecourse.ipynb&gt;`__-  `Calibrated flow   cytometry &lt;https://github.com/cytoflow/cytoflow-examples/blob/master/tasbe/TASBE%20Workflow.ipynb&gt;`__or some `screenshots from theGUI &lt;http://cytoflow.github.io/screenshots.html&gt;`__Note: My ‘day job’ is teaching at a regional comprehensive college, so during the semester I may not have a huge amount of time to respond to bugs and feature requests. I’m still activately developing Cytoflow, so please continue to file bugs!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------What’s wrong with other packages?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Packages such as FACSDiva and FlowJo are focused on primarily onidentifying and counting subpopulations of cells in a multi-channel flowcytometry experiment. While this is important for many differentapplications, it reflects flow cytometry’s origins in separatingmixtures of cells based on differential staining of their cell surfacemarkers.Cytometers can also be used to measure internal cell state, frequentlyas reported by fluorescent proteins such as GFP. In this context, theyfunction in a manner similar to a high-powered plate-reader: instead ofreporting the sum fluorescence of a population of cells, the cytometershows you the *distribution* of the cells’ fluorescence. Thinking interms of distributions, and how those distributions change as you varyan experimental variable, is something existing packages don’t handlegracefully.What’s different about Cytoflow?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A few things.-  **Free and open-source.** Use the software free-of-charge; modify it   to suit your own needs, then contribute your changes back so the rest   of the community can benefit from them.-  A `point-and-click interface &lt;http://cytoflow.github.io/&gt;`__ for easy   analysis.-  **Python modules** to integrate into larger apps, automation, or for   use in a `Jupyter notebook &lt;http://jupyter.org/&gt;`__-  An emphasis on **metadata**. Cytoflow assumes that you are measuring   fluorescence on several samples that were treated differently: either   they were collected at different times, treated with varying levels   of inducers, etc. You specify the conditions for each sample up   front, then use those conditions to facet the analysis.-  Cytometry analysis conceptualized as a **workflow**. Raw cytometry   data is usually not terribly useful: you may gate out cellular debris   and aggregates (using FSC and SSC channels), then compensate for   channel bleed-through, and finally select only transfected cells   before actually looking at the parameters you’re interested in   experimentally. Cytoflow implements a workflow paradigm, where   operations are applied sequentially; a workflow can be saved and   re-used, or shared with your coworkers.-  **Easy to use.** Sane defaults; good documentation; focused on doing   one thing and doing it well.-  **Good visualization.** I don’t know about you, but I’m getting   really tired of FACSDiva plots.-  **Versatile.** Built on Python, with a well-defined library of   operations and visualizations that are well separated from the user   interface. Need an analysis that Cytoflow doesn’t have? Export your   workflow to a Jupyter notebook and use any Python module you want to   complete your analysis. Data is stored in a ``pandas.DataFrame``,   which is rapidly becoming the standard for Python data analysis (and   will make R users feel right at home.)-  **Extensible.** `Adding a new analysis or visualization   module &lt;http://cytoflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/new_modules.html&gt;`__   is simple; the interface to implement is only two or three functions.-  **Quantitative and statistically sound.** Ready access to useful   data-driven tools for analysis, such as fitting 2-dimensional   Gaussians for automated gating and mixture modeling.Installation~~~~~~~~~~~~**If you just want the point-and-click version (not the Python modules),you can install it from http://cytoflow.github.io/**See the `installationnotes &lt;http://cytoflow.readthedocs.org/en/stable/INSTALL.html&gt;`__ on`ReadTheDocs &lt;http://cytoflow.readthedocs.org/&gt;`__. Installation hasbeen tested on Linux, Windows (x86_64) and Mac. Cytoflow is distributedas an `Anaconda &lt;https://www.anaconda.com/&gt;`__ package **(recommended)**as well as a `traditional Pythonpackage &lt;https://pypi.org/project/cytoflow/&gt;`__.Documentation~~~~~~~~~~~~~Cytoflow’s documentation lives at`ReadTheDocs &lt;http://cytoflow.readthedocs.org/&gt;`__. Perhaps of most useis the `moduleindex &lt;http://cytoflow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py-modindex.html&gt;`__.The example `Jupyter &lt;http://jupyter.org/&gt;`__ notebooks, above,demonstrate how the package is intended to be used interactively.</longdescription>
