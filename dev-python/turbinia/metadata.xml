	<longdescription># Turbinia## SummaryTurbinia is an open-source framework for deploying, managing, and runningdistributed forensic workloads. It is intended to automate running of commonforensic processing tools (i.e. Plaso, TSK, strings, etc) to help withprocessing evidence in the Cloud, scaling the processing of large amounts ofevidence, and decreasing response time by parallelizing processing wherepossible.&lt;img src=&quot;docs/images/turbinia-logo.jpg?raw=true&quot; width=240&gt;## How it worksTurbinia is composed of different components for the client, server and theworkers. These components can be run in the Cloud, on local machines, or as ahybrid of both. The Turbinia client makes requests to process evidence to theTurbinia server. The Turbinia server creates logical jobs from these incominguser requests, which creates and schedules forensic processing tasks to be runby the workers. The evidence to be processed will be split up by the jobs whenpossible, and many tasks can be created in order to process the evidence inparallel. One or more workers run continuously to process tasks from the server.Any new evidence created or discovered by the tasks will be fed back intoTurbinia for further processing.Communication from the client to the server is currently done with either GoogleCloud PubSub or [Kombu](https://github.com/celery/kombu) messaging. The workerimplementation can use either [PSQ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/psq)(a Google Cloud PubSub Task Queue) or [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/)for task scheduling.The main documentation for Turbinia can be[found here](https://turbinia.readthedocs.io/). You can also find out more aboutthe architecture and[how it works here](https://turbinia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/how-it-works.html).## StatusTurbinia is currently in Alpha release.## InstallationThere is an[installation guide here](https://turbinia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install.html).## UsageThe basic steps to get things running after the initial installation andconfiguration are:*   Start Turbinia server component with `turbiniactl server` command*   Start Turbinia API server component with `turbiniactl api_server` command if using Celery*   Start one or more Turbinia workers with `turbiniactl celeryworker` if using Celery, or `turbiniactl psqworker` if using PSQ*   Install `turbinia-client` via `pip install turbinia-client`*   Send evidence to be processed from the turbinia client with `turbinia-client submit ${evidencetype}`*   Check status of running tasks with `turbinia-client status`turbinia-client can be used to interact with Turbinia through the API server component, and here is the basicusage:```$ turbinia-client -hUsage: turbinia-client [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
