	<longdescription># FylePython SDK for accessing Fyle Platform APIs. [Fyle](https://www.fylehq.com/) is an expense management system.## InstallationThis project requires [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) library (pip install requests).1. Download this project and use it (copy it in your project, etc).2. Install it from [pip](https://pypi.org).                $ pip install fyle## UsageTo use this SDK you'll need these Fyle credentials used for OAuth2 authentication: **client ID**, **client secret** and **refresh token**. You can follow the steps on this [Article](https://help.fylehq.com/en/articles/3045578-integrating-with-fyle) or reach out to support@fylehq.com.This SDK is very easy to use.* First you'll need to create a connection using the main class Platform.```pythonfrom fyle.platform import Platformfyle = Platform(    server_url='FYLE SERVER URL',    token_url='FYLE TOKEN URL',    refresh_token='FYLE REFRESH TOKEN',    client_id='FYLE CLIENT ID',    client_secret='FYLE CLIENT SECRET')```*  You can access the V1beta version of the APIs as follows:```python&quot;&quot;&quot;USAGE: &lt;Platform INSTANCE&gt;.&lt;VERSION: eg. v1beta&gt;.&lt;FYLE ROLE: eg. admin&gt;.&lt;API_NAME: eg. expenses&gt;.&lt;API_METHOD: eg. get&gt;(&lt;PARAMETERS&gt;)&quot;&quot;&quot;# Get a list of all Expenses in a paginated manner and add to a listexpenses = []query_params = {    'order': 'created_at.desc'}expenses_generator = fyle.v1beta.admin.expenses.list_all(query_params=query_params)for response in expenses_generator:    if response.get('data'):        expenses.extend(response['data'])```## Integration Tests1. Install [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/) package using pip as follows:```pip install pytest```2. Add the following environment variables to test_credentials.sh file```    export SERVER_URL=&lt;FYLE SERVER URL&gt;    export TOKEN_URL=&lt;FYLE TOKEN URL&gt;    export REFRESH_TOKEN=&lt;FYLE REFRESH TOKEN&gt;    export CLIENT_ID=&lt;FYLE CLIENT ID&gt;    export CLIENT_SECRET=&lt;FYLE CLIENT SECRET&gt;```##### NOTE: The credentials used should have required roles assigned to them3. Apply secrets and Run integration tests as follows:```source test_credentials.sh  &amp;&amp; python -m pytest test/integration```4. To get the code coverage execute the following:```pytest test/ --cov```Currently the code coverage is at 95%## Release latest version to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/fyle/)* Open the releases section on GitHub and [Draft a new release](https://github.com/fylein/fyle-platform-sdk-py/releases/new).* Check the version in setup.py, make sure you update that version along with your changes.* Add the version and description and click ok `Publish Release` button.* This will trigger the github action and automatically push the SDK to PyPi## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details</longdescription>
