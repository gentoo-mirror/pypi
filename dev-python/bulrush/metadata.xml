	<longdescription>Bulrush=======A [Bulma][1]-based [Pelican][2] blog theme; clean, flexible and responsive. ![Screenshot - Bulrush at 1440px][13]The icons are from [Font Awesome][3] by Dave Gandy. The pure HTML/CSS &quot;Fork meon GitHub&quot; ribbon is based on [`github-fork-ribbon-css`][4] by Simon Whitaker; Imodified it to be flatter.Features-------- - [x] **Responsive design** - four column layout on desktop (≥980px), three columnon tablet (≥769px), single column on mobile. Tabbed navigation bar collapsesinto drop-down &quot;burger menu&quot; on mobile. - [x] **Meta tagging functionality** - support for [Open Graph][5] and [TwitterCards][6] meta tags, giving enhanced display when sharing articles on socialmedia sites (**note**: *currently only available for [articles and pages][7]*). - [x] **Printable layouts** - the navigation is hidden when printed, avoidingwasted space. - [x] **Custom styling** - additional CSS files can be included to customisethe default styling. - [x] **Service integrations** - including Disqus, GitHub, Google Analyticsand MailChimp. - [x] **PyPI package available** - so it can be `pip install`-ed.Installation------------Bulrush is available via the [Python Package Index][22], so you can install itwith:```bashpip install bulrush```The main exports from the module are: - `PATH`: the path to the theme; - `FILTERS`: the additional Jinja filters used by the theme; and - `ENVIRONMENT`: the Jinja environment required by the theme.You can use them in your `pelicanconf.py` as follows:```pythonimport bulrushTHEME = bulrush.PATHJINJA_ENVIRONMENT = bulrush.ENVIRONMENTJINJA_FILTERS = bulrush.FILTERS```### Other RequirementsYou need to make the appropriate Pelican plugin, [`assets`][15], available. Oneway of achieving this is to make the `pelican-plugin` repository a submodule ofyour site, then you can add to your `pelicanconf.py`:```pythonPLUGIN_PATHS = ['pelican-plugins']PLUGINS = ['assets']```**Note**: referencing the Pelican plugins in this way may have implications forthe license of your project. See https://github.com/textbook/bulrush/issues/17.### AlternativeIf you don't want to install the theme from PyPI you can simply give Pelican arelative path to the inner `bulrush/` directory. For example, add `bulrush` asa submodule and set:```pythonTHEME = 'bulrush/bulrush'```In this case you will need to configure the environment and filters yourselfand ensure that `webassets` *is* installed from PyPI.Additional Screenshots---------------------- - 480 x 480px (mobile):     ![Screenshot - Bulrush at 480px][11] - 840 x 480px (tablet):     ![Screenshot - Bulrush at 840px][12] - 980 x 480px (desktop):     ![Screenshot - Bulrush at 980px][10]Settings--------As well as the [basic settings][14], Bulrush supports the following options inyour `pelicanconf.py`:| Setting name | What does it do? || --- | --- || `BULRUSH_SHOW_SUMMARY` | A boolean, whether to show a summary rather than full article on index, category and tag pages. Defaults to `False`. || `DISQUS_SITENAME` | Enables Disqus comments. Note that you should set up the full Comment Count Link, as no additional text is applied. || `GITHUB_URL` | Enables the &quot;Fork me on GitHub&quot; ribbon. || `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS` | Set to `'UA-XXXX-YYYY'` to activate Google Analytics. || `LICENSE` | A string or dictionary describing the license for the site; see details below. || `LINKS` | A list of tuples `('Title', 'URL')` for links to appear in the &quot;blogroll&quot; section of the sidebar. || `MAILCHIMP` | Configure to activate a [MailChimp][20] sign-up form; see details below. || `MENUITEMS` | A list of tuples `('Title', 'URL')` for items to appear in the tabbed navigation. || `SITESUBTITLE` | A subtitle to appear in the header. || `SOCIAL` | A list of tuples `('Title', 'URL')` to appear in the &quot;social&quot; section of the sidebar. || `TWITTER_USERNAME` | Enables Twitter meta-tags in the article and page headers. |If `DISPLAY_CATEGORIES_ON_MENU` is omitted or set explicitly to `True`, thecategories are shown in the tabbed navigation with any `MENUITEMS`. If`DISPLAY_PAGES_ON_MENU` is omitted or set explicitly to `True`, they are listedin the sidebar with any `SOCIAL` or other `LINKS`.### Social LinksAppropriate icons are provided in the sidebar for a range of sites in the`SOCIAL` link list. Have a look in [`social.html`][17] to see which titles thisapplies to. If none of the sites are a match, then: - if the second, URL element in the tuple starts with `'mailto:'`, an envelope   icon is used; otherwise - a globe icon is used. ![Screenshot - Social icons in sidebar][24]### MailChimp ConfigurationIf you're using [MailChimp][20] to handle a mailing list for your blog, youcan configure a subscription form in the sidebar. You need to set three valuesto enable this, which you can get from [the signup form creator][21]. Simplylook for the form action:```html&lt;form action=&quot;//user.region.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=abc123&amp;amp;id=def456&quot; ...```and extract the relevant sections:```pythonMAILCHIMP = dict(    domain='user.region.list-manage.com',    user_id='abc123',    list_id='def456',    validation=True,  # enable jQuery validation)```If you set `validation=False` (or leave it out entirely) you will reduce thepage load (as it won't need 140KB of JavaScript) but won't get inline formsubmission or email validation.You can also add `rewards_url`, providing your unique [MonkeyRewards][19] URL,to enable a *&quot;Powered by MailChimp&quot;* link.### License SettingsYou can provide one of two options to specify the license for your content: - License name (`str`): The name of the license to display. Unless otherwise   specified, a default icon ([`file-text-o`][23]) will be used and the entry   will link to the current page.   Creative Commons license names (e.g. `'CC BY-SA 4.0'`) are automatically   recognised and an appropriate icon and link are generated. - License definition (`dict`): A dictionary specifying the `name`, `url` and   optional `icon` (must be a Font Awesome icon name, default is   [`file-text-o`][23]).The license details will be displayed at the bottom of the sidebar on everypage.Custom Styling--------------If any of the entries in `EXTRA_PATH_METADATA` have `'path'`s ending with`'.css'` they will be included in the base template, allowing the site styleto be overridden as required. For example, in your `pelicanconf.py`:```python# Static filesSTATIC_PATHS = [    'extra',    ...]EXTRA_PATH_METADATA = {    'extra/custom.css': {'path': 'custom.css'},    ...}```In use------Here are few current users of Bulrush (or modified versions of it): - [textbook](http://blog.jonrshar.pe/) - [Simon Says](https://simonsays.neocities.org/) - [CodeRobot](http://coderobot.downley.net/)If you'd like to be featured here (or are and would prefer not to be), feelfree to submit a [pull request][18].
