Run `ipython` or `python`2. In `ipython`/`python`, run the following code (you can modify it if you need to specify your driver)3. ```pythonfrom linkedin_scraper import Personfrom selenium import webdriverdriver = webdriver.Chrome()person = Person(&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-iguodala-65b48ab5&quot;, driver = driver, scrape=False)```4. Login to Linkedin5. [OPTIONAL] Logout of Linkedin6. In the same `ipython`/`python` code, run```pythonperson.scrape()```The reason is that LinkedIn has recently blocked people from viewing certain profiles without having previously signed in. So by setting `scrape=False`, it doesn't automatically scrape the profile, but Chrome will open the linkedin page anyways. You can login and logout, and the cookie will stay in the browser and it won't affect your profile views. Then when you run `person.scrape()`, it'll scrape and close the browser. If you want to keep the browser on so you can scrape others, run it as **NOTE**: For version &gt;= `2.1.0`, scraping can also occur while logged in. Beware that users will be able to see that you viewed their profile.```pythonperson.scrape(close_on_complete=False)``` so it doesn't close.### Scraping sites and login automaticallyFrom verison **2.4.0** on, `actions` is a part of the library that allows signing into Linkedin first. The email and password can be provided as a variable into the function. If not provided, both will be prompted in terminal.```pythonfrom linkedin_scraper import Person, actionsfrom selenium import webdriverdriver = webdriver.Chrome()email = &quot;some-email@email.address&quot;password = &quot;password123&quot;actions.login(driver, email, password) # if email and password isnt given, it'll prompt in terminalperson = Person(&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-iguodala-65b48ab5&quot;, driver=driver)```## API### PersonA Person object can be created with the following inputs:```pythonPerson(linkedin_url=None, name=None, about=[], experiences=[], educations=[], interests=[], accomplishments=[], company=None, job_title=None, driver=None, scrape=True)```#### `linkedin_url`This is the linkedin url of their profile#### `name`This is the name of the person#### `about`This is the small paragraph about the person#### `experiences`This is the past experiences they have. A list of `linkedin_scraper.scraper.Experience`#### `educations`This is the past educations they have. A list of `linkedin_scraper.scraper.Education`#### `interests`This is the interests they have. A list of `linkedin_scraper.scraper.Interest`#### `accomplishment`This is the accomplishments they have. A list of `linkedin_scraper.scraper.Accomplishment`#### `company`This the most recent company or institution they have worked at. #### `job_title`This the most recent job title they have. #### `driver`This is the driver from which to scraper the Linkedin profile. A driver using Chrome is created by default. However, if a driver is passed in, that will be used instead.For example```pythondriver = webdriver.Chrome()person = Person(&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-iguodala-65b48ab5&quot;, driver = driver)```#### `scrape`When this is **True**, the scraping happens automatically. To scrape afterwards, that can be run by the `scrape()` function from the `Person` object.#### `scrape(close_on_complete=True)`This is the meat of the code, where execution of this function scrapes the profile. If *close_on_complete* is True (which it is by default), then the browser will close upon completion. If scraping of other profiles are desired, then you might want to set that to false so you can keep using the same driver. ### Company```pythonCompany(linkedin_url=None, name=None, about_us=None, website=None, headquarters=None, founded=None, company_type=None, company_size=None, specialties=None, showcase_pages=[], affiliated_companies=[], driver=None, scrape=True, get_employees=True)```#### `linkedin_url`This is the linkedin url of their profile#### `name`This is the name of the company#### `about_us`The description of the company#### `website`The website of the company#### `headquarters`The headquarters location of the company#### `founded`When the company was founded#### `company_type`The type of the company#### `company_size`How many people are employeed at the company#### `specialties`What the company specializes in#### `showcase_pages`Pages that the company owns to showcase their products#### `affiliated_companies`Other companies that are affiliated with this one#### `driver`This is the driver from which to scraper the Linkedin profile. A driver using Chrome is created by default. However, if a driver is passed in, that will be used instead.#### `get_employees`Whether to get all the employees of companyFor example```pythondriver = webdriver.Chrome()company = Company(&quot;https://ca.linkedin.com/company/google&quot;, driver=driver)```#### `scrape(close_on_complete=True)`This is the meat of the code, where execution of this function scrapes the company. If *close_on_complete* is True (which it is by default), then the browser will close upon completion. If scraping of other companies are desired, then you might want to set that to false so you can keep using the same driver.## Contribution&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/joeyism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png&quot; alt=&quot;Buy Me A Coffee&quot; style=&quot;height: 41px !important;width: 174px !important;box-shadow: 0px 3px 2px 0px rgba(190, 190, 190, 0.5) !important;-webkit-box-shadow: 0px 3px 2px 0px rgba(190, 190, 190, 0.5) !important;&quot; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;</longdescription>
