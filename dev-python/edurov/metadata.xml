	<longdescription>**********************************************eduROV - Educational Remotely Operated Vehicle**********************************************Stream camera feed from a Raspberry Pi camera to any web browser on the network.Control the robot with your keyboard directly in the browser.The eduROV project is all about spreading the joy of technology and learning.The eduROV is being developed as a DIY ROV kit meant to be affordable andusable by schools, hobbyists, researchers and others as they see fit.We are committed to be fully open-source, both software and hardware-wise,everything we develop will be available to you. Using other open-source and oropen-access tools and platforms.:GitHub: https://github.com/trolllabs/eduROV:PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/edurov/:Documentation: http://edurov.readthedocs.io:Engage eduROV: https://www.edurov.no/.. image:: ./docs/edurov_gui.jpgMain features=============1. **Low video latency**   You can stream HD video from the Raspberry Pi camera to any unit on the same   network with a video delay below 200ms.2. **No setup required**   The package works by displaying the video feed and other content in a web   browser. This means that you can use any device to display your interface.3. **Very easy to use**   With the exception of Pyro4 (which is installed automatically), edurov   doesn't require any other packages or software. Everything is written in   python and html. 4 lines of code is everything needed to get started!4. **Highly customizable**   Since you define the html page yourself, you can make it look and work   exactly the way you want. Use css and javascript as much as you want.5. **True parallelism**   Need to control motors, read sensor values and display video feed at the   same time? edurov can spawn your functions on multiple CPU cores while still   maintaining the possibility to share variables.Prerequisites=============- eduROV requires python 3, if you don't have python installed, you can  download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/- the camera on the raspberry pi has to be enabled, see  https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/camera.mdInstallation============Run the following commands in a terminal on the Raspberry Pi.::  sudo pip3 install edurovFor a more in depth description visit`the official documentation &lt;http://edurov.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_.Usage=====Engage eduROV submersible-------------------------On the Raspberry Pi, run the following command::  edurov-webThis will start the web server and print the ip where the web page can beviewed, e.g. ``Visit the webpage at 192.168.0.197:8000``.Create your own---------------The eduROV package includes multiple classes and functions to facilitateeasy robot communication with video feed. It will get you up and running in amatter of minutes. Visit`the official documentation &lt;http://edurov.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_ for a *gettingstarted*, examples and API.Performance===========The eduROV package were created with a strong focus on keeping the latency ata minimum. When deploying on a wireless network the actual performance willvary depending on factors such as distance, interference and hardware... image:: ./docs/latency.pngAuthor========The package is created by Martin LÃ¸land as part of the master thesis atNorwegian University of Science and Technology 2018</longdescription>
