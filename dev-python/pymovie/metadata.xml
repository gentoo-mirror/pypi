	<longdescription>PyMovie=======PyMovie is a simple (hopefully) application for extracting lightcurves from occultation videos.It is specially designed to be robust in both star tracking and data extraction when thevideo has been disturbed by wind-shake.The name was chosen out of respect and deference to LiMovie, a pioneer applicationpublished many years ago.This application has fewer 'bells and whistles' than LiMovie and so should be easierto use for a newbie.</longdescription>
