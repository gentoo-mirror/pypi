Tests should read like a description of behaviour, not Selenium commands.2 - Reduce the need for hand-written helper methods in Page Objects. Common actions should have universal solutions.3 - Provide a simple pattern for writing maintainable Page Objects.No automation abilities are built directly into the project; it completely relies on being hooked into other libraries.However, implementations using `Splinter &lt;https://github.com/cobrateam/splinter&gt;`_ and `Appium &lt;https://github.com/appium/appium&gt;`_ are available out of the box.Documentation-------------https://stere.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Basic Usage-----------Fundamentally, a Page Object is just a Python class.A minimal Stere Page Object should:1 - Subclass the Page class2 - Declare Fields and Areas in the __init__ methodAs an example, here's the home page for Wikipedia:.. code-block:: python    from stere import Page    from stere.areas import Area, RepeatingArea    from stere.fields import Button, Input, Link, Root, Text    class WikipediaHome(Page):        def __init__(self):            self.search_form = Area(                query=Input('id', 'searchInput'),                submit=Button('xpath', '//*[@id=&quot;search-form&quot;]/fieldset/button')            )            self.other_projects = RepeatingArea(                root=Root('xpath', '//*[@class=&quot;other-project&quot;]'),                title=Link('xpath', '//*[@class=&quot;other-project-title&quot;]'),                tagline=Text('xpath', '//*[@class=&quot;other-project-tagline&quot;]')            )The search form is represented as an `Area &lt;https://stere.readthedocs.io/en/latest/area.html&gt;`_ with two `Fields &lt;https://stere.readthedocs.io/en/latest/field.html&gt;`_ inside it.A Field represents a single item, while an Area represents a unique collection of Fields.The query and submit Fields didn't have to be placed inside an Area.However, doing so allows you to use Area's `perform() &lt;https://stere.readthedocs.io/en/latest/area.html#stere.areas.Area.perform&gt;`_ method.The links to other products are represented as a `RepeatingArea &lt;https://stere.readthedocs.io/en/latest/area.html#stere.areas.RepeatingArea&gt;`_ .A RepeatingArea represents a non-unique collection of Fields on the page.Using the root argument as the non-unique selector, RepeatingArea will find all instances of said root,then build the appropriate number of Areas with all the other Fields inside.It's just as valid to declare each of the other products as a separate Areaone at a time, like so:.. code-block:: python    self.commons = Area(        root=Root('xpath', '//*[@class=&quot;other-project&quot;][1]'),        title=Link('xpath', '//*[@class=&quot;other-project-title&quot;]'),        tagline=Text('xpath', '//*[@class=&quot;other-project-tagline&quot;]')    )    self.wikivoyage = Area(        root=Root('xpath', '//*[@class=&quot;other-project&quot;][2]'),        title=Link('xpath', '//*[@class=&quot;other-project-title&quot;]'),        tagline=Text('xpath', '//*[@class=&quot;other-project-tagline&quot;]')    )Which style you pick depends entirely on how you want to model the page.RepeatingArea does the most good with collections where the number of areas and/or the contents of the areascan't be predicted, such as inventory lists.Using a Page Object in a test can be done like so:.. code-block:: python    def test_search_wikipedia():        home = WikipediaHome()        home.search_form.perform('kittens')License-------Distributed under the terms of the `MIT`_ license, &quot;Stere&quot; is free and open source softwareIssues------If you encounter any problems, please `file an issue`_ along with a detailed description.Thanks------Cross-browser Testing Platform and Open Source &lt;3 Provided by `Sauce Labs`_.. _`file an issue`: https://github.com/jsfehler/stere/issues.. _`MIT`: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.. _`Sauce labs`: https://saucelabs.com</longdescription>
