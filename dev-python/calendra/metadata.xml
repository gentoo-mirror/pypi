Calendra follows the principles of [semver](https://semver.org) for released verisons.If you spot any bug or wish to add a calendar, please refer to the [Contributing doc](https://peopledoc.github.io/workalendar/contributing.html).## Usage sample```python-repl&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import date&gt;&gt;&gt; from calendra.europe import France&gt;&gt;&gt; cal = France()&gt;&gt;&gt; cal.holidays(2012)[(datetime.date(2012, 1, 1), 'New year'), (datetime.date(2012, 4, 9), 'Easter Monday'), (datetime.date(2012, 5, 1), 'Labour Day'), (datetime.date(2012, 5, 8), 'Victory in Europe Day'), (datetime.date(2012, 5, 17), 'Ascension Day'), (datetime.date(2012, 5, 28), 'Whit Monday'), (datetime.date(2012, 7, 14), 'Bastille Day'), (datetime.date(2012, 8, 15), 'Assumption of Mary to Heaven'), (datetime.date(2012, 11, 1), &quot;All Saints' Day&quot;), (datetime.date(2012, 11, 11), 'Armistice Day'), (datetime.date(2012, 12, 25), 'Christmas')]&gt;&gt;&gt; cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 25))  # it's ChristmasFalse&gt;&gt;&gt; cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 30))  # it's SundayFalse&gt;&gt;&gt; cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 26))True&gt;&gt;&gt; cal.add_working_days(date(2012, 12, 23), 5)  # 5 working days after Xmasdatetime.date(2012, 12, 31)```For a more complete documentation and advanced usage, go to [the official workalendar documentation](https://workalendar.github.io/workalendar).## External dependenciesCalendra has been tested on the Python versions declared in setup.cfg.## TestsTo run test, just install tox with `pip install tox` and run `tox`from the command line.## Available Calendars### Europe- Austria- Belarus- Belgium- Bulgaria- Cayman Islands- Croatia- Cyprus- Czech Republic- Denmark- Estonia- European Central Bank- Finland- France- France (Alsace / Moselle)- Georgia- Germany- Greece- Guernsey- Hungary- Iceland- Ireland- Italy- Latvia- Lithuania- Luxembourg- Malta- Monaco- Netherlands (optionally with school holidays and carnival)- Norway- Poland- Portugal- Romania- Russia- Serbia- Slovakia- Slovenia- Spain (Andalusia, Aragon, Castile and León, Castilla-La Mancha, Canary Islands, Extremadura, Galicia, Balearic Islands, La Rioja, Community of Madrid, Murcia, Navarre, Asturias, Basque Country, Cantabria, Valencian Community)- Sweden- Switzerland (Aargau, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Bern, Basel-Landschaft, Basel-Stadt, Fribourg, Geneva, Glarus, Graubünden, Jura, Luzern, Neuchâtel, Nidwalden, Obwalden, St. Gallen, Schaffhausen, Solothurn, Schwyz, Thurgau, Ticino, Uri, Vaud, Valais, Zug, Zurich)- Turkey- Ukraine- United Kingdom (incl.

The most common example is the Islamic calendar, where some computed holidays are not exactly on the same official day decided by religious authorities, and this may vary country by country. Whenever it's possible, try to adjust your results with the official data provided by the adequate authorities.Some countries have some holidays based on ephemerids and equinoxes. Those are computed for the previous and next 30 years to prevent big computations and dependencies.## ContributingPlease read our [contributing.md](https://github.com/workalendar/workalendar/blob/master/docs/contributing.md) document to discover how you can contribute to `workalendar`. Pull-requests are very welcome.## HistoryThis project was born in 2013, as an answer to the question &quot;how do we calculate *this date + 5 working days*?&quot;. It was a use-case for [PeopleDoc](https://www.people-doc.fr/), in their ticketing application, for calculating SLAs. And it began as a small open-source library, for France and the USA at first.Thanks to PeopleDoc, this project grew and eventually became a world-wide library, with the help of dozens of contributors.As of June 2021, this project has moved to its own organization.## LicenseThis library is published under the terms of the MIT License.
