Itdoes not manage installation of environments and packages but focuses onvalidation.Dante will help you keep track of dependencies with just a few simple commands.Unlike some other tools, it is not as opinionated, and is highly configurable.While it uses standard requirements files, a parser can be written for anyother file type.## Recommended conventionFiles to use:- **requirements.txt** for used project packages- **requirements.lock** for deployment packages- **requirements-dev.txt** for used development packages- **requirements-dev.lock** for all test environment packagesLock files enforce exact versions for all packages.When deploying and preparing the environment only install from lock files.## InstallationDante can be found on PyPI and can simply be installed with:    pip install danteSince version 2, it no longer installs it's own dependencies, but insteadvendors them to avoid possible false positives.## ConfigurationDante has a default configuration which can be overridden using a standard`setup.cfg` file. Configurable properties are as follows:|Property|Description||---|---||**checks**|Checks to run when calling the `check` command. Defaults are `conflicts`, `cyclic`, `missing`, `validate`.||**ignore_list**|List of package keys to ignore. Defaults are `dante`, `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel`.||**allow_named_versions**|Whether to allow custom named versions (invalid by default) for packages. Default is `false`.||**named_version_patterns**|List of regex patterns that will determine named versions. Default is empty.||**requirements_files**|List of requirement files used in the project. Defaults to `requirements.txt`.||**lock_files**|List of lock files used in the project. Defaults to `requirements.lock`.||**lock_file_path**|Path of the lock file that will be generated with `dante lock --save`.||**parser**|Parser to use to read/write requirements/lock files. Currently only the default is supported.||**any_version**|Undefined version name. Default is `Any`.||**graph_name**|Name of the graph that will be created. Defaults to `dante-graph`.||**graph_filename**|Filename of the graph that will be created. Defaults to `dante-graph.pdf` in the working directory.||**graph_format**|Format of the graph that will be created. Defaults to `pdf`. Supports all graphviz formats.||**graph_engine**|Engine of the graph that will be created. Defaults to `dot`. Supports all graphviz engines.||**graph_attributes**|Custom graph attributes. Supports all graphviz attributes.||**graph_strict**|Whether the graphviz graph follows strict rules. Defaults to `True`.||**graph_node_attributes**|Custom graph node attributes. Defaults to setting `shape` to `box3d`. Supports all graphviz node attributes.||**graph_edge_attributes**|Custom graph edge attributes. Defaults to setting `fontsize` to `10`. Supports all graphviz edge attributes.|## Functionality### Commands|Command|Description||---|---||**list**|List all dependencies|**tree**|Show dependency tree|**config**|Print configuration|**validate**|Validate requirements and lock files|**conflicts**|Check for conflicts in required dependencies|**cyclic**|Check for cyclic dependencies|**missing**|Show missing dependencies|**check**|Run a complete list of checks|**lock**|Display or generate lock file from environment and/or requirements file(s)|**graph**|Export a dependency graph using graphvizNote: Almost all command flags have shorthands that are equivalent to the firstletter of their name. They can be displayed with the help command.### VersionThe version flag will get dante to display it's installed version end exit:    dante --version### Dante commandDante has several flags on the CLI's top level:- `--all` - Shows all packages (Does not use the ignore list)- `--ignore IGNORE` - Ignore specified package. Can be used multiple times.### Dependency listLists all packages relevant to the project:    dante list [--requirements REQUIREMENTS]Flag|Shorthand|Description|---|---|---||**--requirements**|**-r**|Requirements file to use (will ignore `setup.cfg`)|Unlike `pip freeze` unless it's used with the `--all` flag dante will onlydisplay packages that are required for the project. This is determined by usinginstalled packages and requirements files.### Dependency treeDisplays a dependency tree for a single package or the entire environment:    dante tree [--package PACKAGE] [--requirements REQUIREMENTS]Flag|Shorthand|Description|---|---|---||**--package**|**-p**|Package to display the tree for||**--requirements**|**-r**|Requirements file to use (will ignore `setup.cfg`)|### ConfigurationDisplays the current configuration in JSON format:    dante configExample result:~~~json{    &quot;dante&quot;: {        &quot;any_version&quot;: &quot;Any&quot;,        &quot;checks&quot;: [            &quot;conflicts&quot;,            &quot;cyclic&quot;,            &quot;missing&quot;,            &quot;validate&quot;        ],        &quot;ignore_list&quot;: [            &quot;dante&quot;,            &quot;pip&quot;,            &quot;setuptools&quot;,            &quot;wheel&quot;        ],        &quot;allow_named_versions&quot;: true,        &quot;named_version_patterns&quot;: [            &quot;0.*version&quot;        ],        &quot;lock_file_path&quot;: &quot;requirements-dev.lock&quot;,        &quot;requirements_files&quot;: [            &quot;requirements-dev.lock&quot;        ],        &quot;lock_files&quot;: [            &quot;requirements-dev.lock&quot;        ],        &quot;graph_name&quot;: &quot;dante-graph&quot;,        &quot;graph_filename&quot;: null,        &quot;graph_format&quot;: &quot;pdf&quot;,        &quot;graph_engine&quot;: &quot;dot&quot;,        &quot;graph_strict&quot;: true    },    &quot;graph_attributes&quot;: {},    &quot;graph_node_attributes&quot;: {        &quot;shape&quot;: &quot;box3d&quot;    },    &quot;graph_edge_attributes&quot;: {        &quot;fontsize&quot;: &quot;10&quot;    }}~~~### ValidationPerforms various checks on requirements and lock files:    dante validate [-requirments REQUIREMENTS] [--lock LOCK] [--strict]Flag|Shorthand|Description|---|---|---||**--requirements**|**-r**|Requirements file to use (will ignore `setup.cfg`)||**--lock**|**-l**|Lock file to use (will ignore `setup.cfg`)||**--strict**|**-r**|Run strict checks|The checks performed are as follows:- Check if all set requirements are set to a version or a version range- Check if all locked requirements are set to an exact version- Check if all installed package versions match the locked requirement versions- Check if all required versions match the locked requirement versionsSuccessful run will print out:    All set requirements locked    No unset locks found    All package versions matching    All requirement versions matchingRunning validation with the `--strict` flag will add some additional checks:- Check if there are installed packages that are not required by anything- Check if there are locked requirements that are not required by anythingIt is recommended to use the strict check whenever it's possible.Successful run will print out:    No non-required packages found    No non-required locks found### Conflicting dependenciesDetects conflicts between installed packages:    dante conflictsConflicts can occur when multiple packages require the same package withincompatible versions (e.g. one requires &lt;1.0.0 and the other &gt;2.0.0).Successful run will print out:    No conflicts found### Cyclic dependenciesDetects cyclical dependencies in installed packages:    dante cyclicThis can occur when there is a cyclical path in package dependencies (e.g.`package1` requires `package2` which requires `package3`, which in turnrequires `package1`). Successful run will print out:    No cyclic dependencies found### Missing dependenciesDetects if there are required packages that are not installed in the environment:    dante missing [--requirements REQUIREMENTS]Flag|Shorthand|Description|---|---|---||**--requirements**|-r|Requirements file to use (will ignore `setup.cfg`)|Successful run will print out:    No missing dependencies found## CheckRuns all defined checks at once:    dante check [--requirements REQUIREMENTS] [--lock LOCK] [--strict]Flag|Shorthand|Description|---|---|---||**--requirements**|**-r**|Requirements file to use (will ignore `setup.cfg`)||**--lock**|**-l**|Lock file to use (will ignore `setup.cfg`)||**--strict**|**-r**|Run strict checks|Successful run with all checks will print out:    All set requirements locked    No unset locks found    All package versions matching    All requirement versions matching    No non-required packages found    No non-required locks found    No conflicts found    No cyclic dependencies found    No missing dependencies found## LockDisplays or saves locked requirements for the current project:    dante lock [--requirements REQUIREMENTS] [--save] [--file FILE]Flag|Shorthand|Description|---|---|---||**--requirements**|**-r**|Requirements file to use (will ignore `setup.cfg`)||**--save**|**-s**|Save to file||**--file**|**-f**|Filename to save to (will override `setup.cfg`)|Locked requirements are determined by walking through all installed packagesand provided requirements recursively retrieving their dependencies.Only the requirements that are needed for the project will be returned.## GraphReturns a dependency graph description or renders it to a file:    dante graph [--strict] [--render] [--view] [--name NAME] [--filename FILENAME]                       [--format FORMAT] [--engine ENGINE]                       [--graph_attr GRAPH_ATTR] [--node_attr NODE_ATTR]                       [--edge_attr EDGE_ATTR]Flag|Shorthand|Description|---|---|---||**--render**|**-r**|Render graph to file||**--view**|**-v**|Display graph after rendering||**--strict**|**-s**|Use strict graph rules||**--name**| |Graph name||**--filename**| |Filename to save graph to||**--format**| |Graph file format||**--engine**| |Graph engine||**--graph_attr**| |Graph attributes||**--node_attr**| |Graph node attributes||**--edge_attr**| |Graph edge attributes|## ApiDante exposes it's operations through the api module, so they can be importedand used in your libraries/applications:Example for retrieving installed packages:~~~pythonfrom dante.api import dependency_listinstalled_packages = dependency_list()~~~## CIDante can be used as a CI checking tool, with proper configuration in`setup.cfg` configured, all it takes to run a check on any CI is:    dante checkDante includes error codes when run through the CLI, so it will fail the buildif any problems are detected.Note: It's recommended to use the strict check whenever it's possible, sinceunnecessary requirements can still cause problems in the environments(e.g. can overwrite other package's files...):    dante check --strict## TestsTo run tests simply install all dependencies from `requirements-dev.lock` and run:~~~pytest --cov-config setup.cfg~~~## Roadmap:- Full documentation</longdescription>
