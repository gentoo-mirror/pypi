[![](autoapi/tasks/workflows/Curate.png)](autoapi/tasks/workflows/index.html#tasks.workflows.Curate)- **Annotate:** create various annotations on morphologies needed by specific BBP codes.  [![](autoapi/tasks/workflows/Annotate.png)](autoapi/tasks/workflows/index.html#tasks.workflows.Annotate)- **Repair:** process morphologies to correct for artifacts of in-vitro reconstruction.  [![](autoapi/tasks/workflows/Repair.png)](autoapi/tasks/workflows/index.html#tasks.workflows.Repair)In a nutshell, the user provides a list of morphologies in a ``.csv`` file, with their names andpaths and a ``luigi.cfg`` configuration file. Each workflow is run independently and creates anoutput folder, with one subfolder per task. In each, there will be a ``report.csv`` and a ``data``folder containing the output files of the task if any. In the ``report.csv`` file, columns containpaths to these files, additional information, error messages if the task failed on thatmorphologies, as well as a flag ``is_valid``, used in subsequent tasks to filter valid morphologies.At the end of each workflow, another ``report.csv`` file is created, with the main output columns ofeach tasks, and a ``report.pdf`` containing a human readable summary of the result of the workflow.Usually, the user should run the ``Curate`` workflow, then the ``Annotate`` workflow and finally the``Repair`` workflow.The complete documentation can be found here:  * stable: https://morphology-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/stable/  * latest: https://morphology-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/## InstallationThis should be installed using pip:```bashpip install morphology-workflows```## Usage### Create inputs for the workflows using the **Initialize** workflowUsually, user should create a new project folder using this workflow. It will create the filesrequired to run the other workflows. For example, the command:```bashmorphology-workflows Initialize --source-database NeuroMorpho```will create the inputs to download the morphologies from the NeuroMorpho database and the run theother workflows on these morphologies.If the user wants to provide arbitrary morphologies to the **Curate** / **Annotate** / **Repair**workflows, the following command can be used:```bashmorphology-workflows Initialize --input-dir &lt;path-to-the-morphologies&gt;```in order to create the dataset required by these workflows.Once the **Initialize** workflows is complete, the user can update the outputs according to itsneeds (see the next sections for details about each workflow).### Create inputs for the **Fetch** workflowThis workflow helps fetching morphologies from online databases. This workflow only needs aconfiguration file, which depends on the source from which the morphologies are fetched.The possible sources are:* NeuroMorpho* MouseLight* AllenFor each of them, the configuration file should be a JSON file containing a list of objects likethe following examples:* NeuroMorpho:  ```JSON  [      {          &quot;species&quot;: &quot;mouse&quot;,          &quot;brain_region&quot;: &quot;neocortex&quot;,          &quot;cell_type&quot;: &quot;interneuron&quot;,          &quot;nb_morphologies&quot;: 10      }  ]  ```* MouseLight:  ```JSON  [      {          &quot;brain_region&quot;: &quot;neocortex&quot;,          &quot;nb_morphologies&quot;: 10,          &quot;seed&quot;: 0      }  ]  ```* Allen:  ```JSON  [      {          &quot;species&quot;: &quot;Mus musculus&quot;,          &quot;brain_region&quot;: &quot;VISli&quot;,          &quot;cell_type&quot;: &quot;pyramidal&quot;,          &quot;nb_morphologies&quot;: 10,          &quot;seed&quot;: 0      }  ]  ```In these examples, the ``seed`` attribute is optional and is only used to sample which morphologiesare fetched among those which pass the filter.Each `JSON` object in the list will give a set of morphologies to fetch, depending on the givenfilters.Note that all attributes are optional, so it's possible to pass an empty object to fetch all themorphologies from the database, though it is not recommended.### Create inputs for the **Curate**, **Annotate** and **Repair** workflowsThe **Annotate** and **Repair** workflows should usually be run after the **Curate** workflow sincetheir inputs should be the outputs of the **Curate** workflow. But it is still possible to run themon arbitrary inputs (though the morphologies must be valid, as the ones processed by the **Curate**workflow).The inputs should consist in:* a directory containing the input morphologies.* a CSV file with the following columns:    1. ``morph_path``: the path to the morphology file.    2. ``morph_name``: the name of the morphology.    3. ``mtype``: the morphology-type of the morphology (this column is optional).  Any other column is kept into the results but not used in the workflows.  Note that the column names should not contain spaces between commas and names.* a ``luigi.cfg`` file containing the configuration for all the tasks of the workflow.* an optional ``logging.conf`` file containing the logging configuration. If you prefer default logging  behavior, remove this file and comment line in ``logging_conf_file = logging.conf`` in ``luigi.cfg``.The [examples](https://github.com/BlueBrain/morphology-workflows/tree/main/examples) folder containsexamples for the ``luigi.cfg`` and ``logging.conf`` files.These inputs can be created using the **Fetch** workflow that downloads morphlogies from onlinedatabases and create the dataset in the correct format.### Run the workflowsThese workflows are based on the ``luigi`` library but can be run via the command line interface.For example, you can run the ``Curate`` workflow with the following command:```bashmorphology-workflows Curate```&gt; **NOTE:** This command must be executed from a directory containing a ``luigi.cfg`` file.&gt; An example of such file is given in the ``examples`` directory.By default, a local scheduler is used but it is also possible to use a Luigi's master schedulerusing the `-m / --master-scheduler` trigger:```bashmorphology-workflows -m Curate```Once the **Curate** workflow has run, the **Annotate** and **Repair** workflows can be rundirectly, they will just take the results of the **Curate** workflow as input:```bashmorphology-workflows Annotatemorphology-workflows Repair```Note that it is also possible to run the 3 workflows directly because each workflow depends on each other:```bashmorphology-workflows Repair```More details can be found in the command line interface section of the documentation or by runningthe commands:```bashmorphology-workflows --helpmorphology-workflows &lt;workflow&gt; --help```## ResultsEach workflow will create several new directories, one for each sub-step. These new directories canbe nested into a global result directory for each workflow, using the ``result_path`` parameter.These directories contain intermediate data so it is possible to understand why a morphologycould not be validated at a given step.The invalid morphologies should be manually fixed before being processed again by the workflows.The main workflows (**Curate**, **Annotate** and **Repair**) will also create a final CSV filewhich contains most of the relevant data of the workflow (main sub-step results and finalmorphology paths). Finally, the **Repair** workflow can generate morphology releases that containthe final morphologies that could be validated and automatically fixed by the workflow. Usuallythese morphologies are the most relevant ones for later use.## ExamplesThe [examples](https://github.com/BlueBrain/morphology-workflows/tree/main/examples) folder containsa simple example that will fetch and process a set of morphologies.A ``dataset.csv`` file is provided which is taken as input for the workflows. A ``luigi.cfg`` fileis also provided to give a default configuration for the workflows.This example can simply be run using the following command:```bash./run_curation.sh```This script will create a new directory ``out_curated`` which will contain the report and all theresults.## Funding &amp; AcknowledgmentThe development of this software was supported by funding to the Blue Brain Project, a researchcenter of the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), from the Swiss government’s ETH Boardof the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology.For license and authors, see `LICENSE.txt` and `AUTHORS.md` respectively.Copyright © 2021-2022 Blue Brain Project/EPFL</longdescription>
