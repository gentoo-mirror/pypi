That is, in its own lineand separated by blank lines.For code include, use `!include` statement in a code block:````markdown```cpp!include filename.cpp```````The path can be either absolute or relative to the **current** file's directory.Besides, [unix-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) pathname can used.(If the include statement is used in an included file,then the path is absolute or relative to the included file itself.)If there are special characters in the filename, use quotes:```!include &quot;filename with space&quot;!include 'filename&quot;with&quot;quotes'```If the filename contains special sequences in markdown, use backquotes:(**Note**: this also applies to include statment in code blocks)```!include `__filename__````The second syntax may lead to wrong highlighting when using a markdown editor.If it happens, use the first syntax.Also make sure that there are no circular includes.The `!include` command also supports options:```!include`&lt;key1&gt;=&lt;value1&gt;, &lt;key2&gt;=&lt;value2&gt;` some_file```For example, to specify line ranges in options:```!include`startLine=1, endLine=10` some_file```Or to include snippets with enclosed delimiters:```!include`snippetStart=&quot;&lt;!-- Start --&gt;&quot;, snippetEnd=&quot;&lt;!-- End --&gt;&quot;` some_file```where `&lt;!-- Start --&gt;` and `&lt;!-- End --&gt;` are two strings occuring in `some_file`.If multiple occurences of `&lt;!-- Start --&gt;` or `&lt;!-- End --&gt;` are in `some_file`, then pandoc-include will include all the blocks between the delimiters.If `snippetEnd` or `snippetStart` is not found or specified, it will include till the end or from the start.Supported options:| Key | Value | Description || --- | ----- | ----------- || startLine | `int` | Start line of include (default: 1) || endLine | `int` | End line of include (default: number of the last line) || snippetStart | `str` | Start delimiter of a snippet || snippetEnd | `str` | End delimiter of a snippet || includeSnippetDelimiters | `bool` | Whether to include the delimiters (default: `False`) || incrementSection | `int` | Increment (or decrement) section levels of include || dedent | `int` | Remove n leading whitespaces of each line where possible (`-1` means remove all) || format | `str` | The input format of the included file (see `pandoc --list-input-formats`). It will be automatically deduced from the path if not set. (Hint: extensions can also be enabled here) || raw | `str` | Include as raw block. The arg is the format (`latex`, `html`...) |**Note**: the values above are parsed as Python literals. So `str` should be quoted like `'xxx'` or `&quot;xxx&quot;`; `bool` should be `True` or `False`.### Header options```---include-entry: '&lt;path&gt;'include-order: 'natural'rewrite-path: truepandoc-options:  - --filter=pandoc-include  - &lt;other options&gt;---```#### `include-entry`The `include-entry` option is to make recursive includes work.Its value is a path relative to current working directory or absolutewhere the entry file (the initial file) locates.It should be placed in the entry file only, not in the included files.It is optional and the default `include-entry` value is `.`.For example, to compile a file in current directory, no header is needed:```pandoc test.md --filter pandoc-include -o test.pdf```However, to compile a file not in current directory, like:```pandoc dir/test.md --filter pandoc-include -o test.pdf```The header should now be set to: `include-entry: 'dir'`.#### `include-order`The `include-order` options is to define the order of included files if the unix-style pathname matches multiple files.The default value is `natural`, which means using the [natural order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order).Other possible values are `alphabetical` and `default`.The `default` means to keep the order returned by the Python `glob` module.#### `rewrite-path`The `rewrite-path` option is a boolean value to configure whether the relative paths of images should be rewritten to paths relative to the root file.The default value is `true`.For example, consider the following directory structure:```main.mdcontent/  chapter01.md  image.png```Suppose `chapter01.md` uses the image `image.png`.It should use `![Image](image.png)` if `rewrite-path` is `true`,or `![Image](content/image.png)` if `rewrite-path` is `false`.#### `pandoc-options`The `pandoc-options` option is **a list** to specify the pandoc options when recursively processing included files.By default, the included file will **inherit** the `pandoc-options` from its parent file, **unless** specified in its own file.To make the recursive includes work, `--filter=pandoc-include` is **necessary**.The default value of `pandoc-options` is:```pandoc-options:  - --filter=pandoc-include```## Examples### File includeFile include can be used to separate chapters into different files,or include some latex files:```markdown---title: Articleauthor: Authortoc: true---!include chapters/chap01.md!include chapters/chap02.md!include chapters/chap03.md!include`raw=&quot;latex&quot;` data/table.tex```### Header includeFor header include, it is useful to define a header templateand include it in many files.For example, in the `header.yaml`, we can define basic info:```yamlname: xxxschool: yyyemail: zzz```In the `main.md`, we can extend the header:```markdown---title: Title---!include-header header.yaml# SectionBody```The `main.md` then is equivalent to the follow markdown:```markdown---title: Titlename: xxxschool: yyyemail: zzz---# SectionBody```## Trouble ShootingThe pandoc command-line options are processed in order.If you want some options to be applied in included files,make sure the `--filter pandoc-include` option is specified before those options.For example, use bibliography in the included files:```pandoc main.md --filter pandoc-include --citeproc --bibliography=ref.bib -o main.pdf```## LicenseMIT License</longdescription>
