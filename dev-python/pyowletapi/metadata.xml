	<longdescription># IntroductionFirst pass at creating a wrapper for the Owlet baby monitor api, this currently only supports the sock v3 as I do not have a v2 to test withinspiration and API reverse engineering taken from various projects:https://github.com/BastianPoe/owlet_apihttps://github.com/mbevand/owlet_monitorEnd goal is to create a homeassistant integration using this API. But the intention is that this library will always be usable standalone## InstallTo install via pip run command ```pip install pyowletapi```## To doTidy up exception loggingCreate test routines## Useimport the api and sock objects```pythonfrom pyowletapi.api import OwletAPIfrom pyowlet.sock import Sock```create an api object passing your region, username and password, the OwletAPI will also take a aiohttp session as a keyword argument```pythonapi = OwletAPI('europe', username, password)```you can then authenticate against the Owlet servers using this object and create a list of sock objects```pythonawait api.authenticate()socks = {device['device']['dsn']: Sock(api, device['device']) for device in devices}```to get current reading from sock call the update_properties function on each sock object```pythondevice.update_properties()```This will return a tuple, the first element being the raw response as a dict and the second element is a more cut down dict version of the response showing only the most relevant data.</longdescription>
