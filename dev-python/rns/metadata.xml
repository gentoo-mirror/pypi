It can operate even with very high latencyand extremely low bandwidth. Reticulum allows you to build wide-area networkswith off-the-shelf tools, and offers end-to-end encryption and connectivity,initiator anonymity, autoconfiguring cryptographically backed multi-hoptransport, efficient addressing, unforgeable delivery acknowledgements andmore.The vision of Reticulum is to allow anyone to be their own network operator,and to make it cheap and easy to cover vast areas with a myriad of independent,inter-connectable and autonomous networks. Reticulum **is not** *one* network.It is **a tool** for building *thousands of networks*. Networks withoutkill-switches, surveillance, censorship and control. Networks that can freelyinteroperate, associate and disassociate with each other, and require nocentral oversight. Networks for human beings. *Networks for the people*.Reticulum is a complete networking stack, and does not rely on IP or higherlayers, but it is possible to use IP as the underlying carrier for Reticulum.It is therefore trivial to tunnel Reticulum over the Internet or private IPnetworks.Having no dependencies on traditional networking stacks frees up overhead thathas been used to implement a networking stack built directly on cryptographicprinciples, allowing resilience and stable functionality, even in open andtrustless networks.No kernel modules or drivers are required. Reticulum runs completely inuserland, and can run on practically any system that runs Python 3.## Read The ManualThe full documentation for Reticulum is available at [markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/](https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/).You can also download the [Reticulum manual as a PDF](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum/raw/master/docs/Reticulum%20Manual.pdf) or [as an e-book in EPUB format](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum/raw/master/docs/Reticulum%20Manual.epub).For more info, see [reticulum.network](https://reticulum.network/)## Notable Features- Coordination-less globally unique addressing and identification- Fully self-configuring multi-hop routing- Initiator anonymity, communicate without revealing your identity- Asymmetric X25519 encryption and Ed25519 signatures as a basis for all communication- Forward Secrecy with ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman keys on Curve25519- Reticulum uses the following format for encrypted tokens:  - Keys are ephemeral and derived from an ECDH key exchange on Curve25519  - AES-128 in CBC mode with PKCS7 padding  - HMAC using SHA256 for authentication  - IVs are generated through os.urandom()- Unforgeable packet delivery confirmations- A variety of supported interface types- An intuitive and easy-to-use API- Reliable and efficient transfer of arbitrary amounts of data  - Reticulum can handle a few bytes of data or files of many gigabytes  - Sequencing, transfer coordination and checksumming are automatic  - The API is very easy to use, and provides transfer progress- Lightweight, flexible and expandable Request/Response mechanism- Efficient link establishment  - Total cost of setting up an encrypted and verified link is only 3 packets, totalling 297 bytes  - Low cost of keeping links open at only 0.44 bits per second- Reliable sequential delivery with Channel and Buffer mechanisms## RoadmapWhile Reticulum is already a fully featured and functional networking stack,many improvements and additions are actively being worked on, and planned for the future.To learn more about the direction and future of Reticulum, please see the [Development Roadmap](./Roadmap.md).## Examples of Reticulum ApplicationsIf you want to quickly get an idea of what Reticulum can do, take a look at thefollowing resources.- You can use the [rnsh](https://github.com/acehoss/rnsh) program to establish remote shell sessions over Reticulum.- For an off-grid, encrypted and resilient mesh communications platform, see [Nomad Network](https://github.com/markqvist/NomadNet)- The Android, Linux and macOS app [Sideband](https://github.com/markqvist/Sideband) has a graphical interface and focuses on ease of use.- [LXMF](https://github.com/markqvist/lxmf) is a distributed, delay and disruption tolerant message transfer protocol built on Reticulum## Where can Reticulum be used?Over practically any medium that can support at least a half-duplex channelwith greater throughput than 5 bits per second, and an MTU of 500 bytes. Data radios,modems, LoRa radios, serial lines, AX.25 TNCs, amateur radio digital modes,WiFi and Ethernet devices, free-space optical links, and similar systems areall examples of the types of physical devices Reticulum can use.An open-source LoRa-based interface called[RNode](https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/hardware.html#rnode) hasbeen designed specifically for use with Reticulum. It is possible to buildyourself, or it can be purchased as a complete transceiver that just needs aUSB connection to the host.Reticulum can also be encapsulated over existing IP networks, so there'snothing stopping you from using it over wired Ethernet, your local WiFi networkor the Internet, where it'll work just as well. In fact, one of the strengthsof Reticulum is how easily it allows you to connect different mediums into aself-configuring, resilient and encrypted mesh, using any available mixture ofavailable infrastructure.As an example, it's possible to set up a Raspberry Pi connected to both a LoRaradio, a packet radio TNC and a WiFi network. Once the interfaces areconfigured, Reticulum will take care of the rest, and any device on the WiFinetwork can communicate with nodes on the LoRa and packet radio sides of thenetwork, and vice versa.## How do I get started?The best way to get started with the Reticulum Network Stack depends on whatyou want to do. For full details and examples, have a look at the [Getting Started Fast](https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/gettingstartedfast.html) section of the [Reticulum Manual](https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/).To simply install Reticulum and related utilities on your system, the easiest way is via `pip`.You can then start any program that uses Reticulum, or start Reticulum as a system service with[the rnsd utility](https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/using.html#the-rnsd-utility).```bashpip install rns```If you are using an operating system that blocks normal user package installation via `pip`,you can return `pip` to normal behaviour by editing the `~/.config/pip/pip.conf` file,and adding the following directive in the `[global]` section:```text[global]break-system-packages = true```Alternatively, you can use the `pipx` tool to install Reticulum in an isolated environment:```bashpipx install rns```When first started, Reticulum will create a default configuration file,providing basic connectivity to other Reticulum peers that might be locallyreachable. The default config file contains a few examples, and references forcreating a more complex configuration.If you have an old version of `pip` on your system, you may need to upgrade it first with `pip install pip --upgrade`. If you no not already have `pip` installed, you can install it using the package manager of your system with `sudo apt install python3-pip` or similar.For more detailed examples on how to expand communication over many mediums such as packet radio or LoRa, serial ports, or over fast IP links and the Internet using the UDP and TCP interfaces, take a look at the [Supported Interfaces](https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/interfaces.html) section of the [Reticulum Manual](https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/).## Included UtilitiesReticulum includes a range of useful utilities for managing your networks, viewing status and information, and other tasks. You can read more about these programs in the [Included Utility Programs](https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/using.html#included-utility-programs) section of the [Reticulum Manual](https://markqvist.github.io/Reticulum/manual/).- The system daemon `rnsd` for running Reticulum as an always-available service- An interface status utility called `rnstatus`, that displays information about interfaces- The path lookup and management tool `rnpath` letting you view and modify path tables- A diagnostics tool called `rnprobe` for checking connectivity to destinations- A simple file transfer program called `rncp` making it easy to transfer files between systems- The identity management and encryption utility `rnid` let's you manage Identities and encrypt/decrypt files- The remote command execution program `rnx` let's you run commands and  programs and retrieve output from remote systemsAll tools, including `rnx` and `rncp`, work reliably and well even over verylow-bandwidth links like LoRa or Packet Radio. For full-featured remote shellsover Reticulum, also have a look at the [rnsh](https://github.com/acehoss/rnsh)program.## Supported interface types and devicesReticulum implements a range of generalised interface types that covers most ofthe communications hardware that Reticulum can run over. If your hardware isnot supported, it's relatively simple to implement an interface class. I willgratefully accept pull requests for custom interfaces if they are generallyuseful.Currently, the following interfaces are supported:- Any Ethernet device- LoRa using [RNode](https://unsigned.io/rnode/)- Packet Radio TNCs (with or without AX.25)- KISS-compatible hardware and software modems- Any device with a serial port- TCP over IP networks- UDP over IP networks- External programs via stdio or pipes- Custom hardware via stdio or pipes## PerformanceReticulum targets a *very* wide usable performance envelope, but prioritisesfunctionality and performance on low-bandwidth mediums. The goal is toprovide a dynamic performance envelope from 250 bits per second, to 1 gigabitper second on normal hardware.Currently, the usable performance envelope is approximately 150 bits per secondto 20 megabits per second, with physical mediums faster than that not beingsaturated. Performance beyond the current level is intended for futureupgrades, but not highly prioritised at this point in time.## Current StatusReticulum should currently be considered beta software. All core protocolfeatures are implemented and functioning, but additions will probably occur asreal-world use is explored. There will be bugs. The API and wire-format can beconsidered relatively stable at the moment, but could change if warranted.## DependenciesThe installation of the default `rns` package requires the dependencies listedbelow. Almost all systems and distributions have readily available packages forthese dependencies, and when the `rns` package is installed with `pip`, theywill be downloaded and installed as well.- [PyCA/cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography)- [pyserial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial)On more unusual systems, and in some rare cases, it might not be possible toinstall or even compile one or more of the above modules. In such situations,you can use the `rnspure` package instead, which require no externaldependencies for installation. Please note that the contents of the `rns` and`rnspure` packages are *identical*. The only difference is that the `rnspure`package lists no dependencies required for installation.No matter how Reticulum is installed and started, it will load externaldependencies only if they are *needed* and *available*. If for example you wantto use Reticulum on a system that cannot support[pyserial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial), it is perfectly possible todo so using the `rnspure` package, but Reticulum will not be able to useserial-based interfaces. All other available modules will still be loaded whenneeded.**Please Note!** If you use the `rnspure` package to run Reticulum on systemsthat do not support [PyCA/cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography),it is important that you read and understand the [CryptographicPrimitives](#cryptographic-primitives) section of this document.## Public TestnetIf you just want to get started experimenting without building any physicalnetworks, you are welcome to join the Unsigned.io RNS Testnet. The testnet isjust that, an informal network for testing and experimenting. It will be upmost of the time, and anyone can join, but it also means that there's noguarantees for service availability.The testnet runs the very latest version of Reticulum (often even a short whilebefore it is publicly released). Sometimes experimental versions of Reticulummight be deployed to nodes on the testnet, which means strange behaviour mightoccur. If none of that scares you, you can join the testnet via either TCP orI2P. Just add one of the following interfaces to your Reticulum configurationfile:```# TCP/IP interface to the RNS Amsterdam Hub  [[RNS Testnet Amsterdam]]    type = TCPClientInterface    enabled = yes    target_host = amsterdam.connect.reticulum.network    target_port = 4965# TCP/IP interface to the BetweenTheBorders Hub (community-provided)  [[RNS Testnet BetweenTheBorders]]    type = TCPClientInterface    enabled = yes    target_host = betweentheborders.com    target_port = 4242# Interface to Testnet I2P Hub  [[RNS Testnet I2P Hub]]    type = I2PInterface    enabled = yes    peers = g3br23bvx3lq5uddcsjii74xgmn6y5q325ovrkq2zw2wbzbqgbuq.b32.i2p```The testnet also contains a number of [Nomad Network](https://github.com/markqvist/nomadnet) nodes, and LXMF propagation nodes.## Support ReticulumYou can help support the continued development of open, free and private communications systems by donating via one of the following channels:- Monero: ```  84FpY1QbxHcgdseePYNmhTHcrgMX4nFfBYtz2GKYToqHVVhJp8Eaw1Z1EedRnKD19b3B8NiLCGVxzKV17UMmmeEsCrPyA5w  ```- Ethereum  ```  0x81F7B979fEa6134bA9FD5c701b3501A2e61E897a  ```- Bitcoin  ```  3CPmacGm34qYvR6XWLVEJmi2aNe3PZqUuq  ```- Ko-Fi: https://ko-fi.com/markqvistAre certain features in the development roadmap are important to you or yourorganisation? Make them a reality quickly by sponsoring their implementation.## Cryptographic PrimitivesReticulum uses a simple suite of efficient, strong and modern cryptographicprimitives, with widely available implementations that can be used both ongeneral-purpose CPUs and on microcontrollers. The necessary primitives are:- Ed25519 for signatures- X22519 for ECDH key exchanges- HKDF for key derivation- Modified Fernet for encrypted tokens  - AES-128 in CBC mode  - HMAC for message authentication  - No Fernet version and timestamp fields- SHA-256- SHA-512In the default installation configuration, the `X25519`, `Ed25519` and`AES-128-CBC` primitives are provided by [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)(via the [PyCA/cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography) package).The hashing functions `SHA-256` and `SHA-512` are provided by the standardPython [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html). The `HKDF`,`HMAC`, `Fernet` primitives, and the `PKCS7` padding function are alwaysprovided by the following internal implementations:- [HKDF.py](RNS/Cryptography/HKDF.py)- [HMAC.py](RNS/Cryptography/HMAC.py)- [Fernet.py](RNS/Cryptography/Fernet.py)- [PKCS7.py](RNS/Cryptography/PKCS7.py)Reticulum also includes a complete implementation of all necessary primitivesin pure Python. If OpenSSL &amp; PyCA are not available on the system whenReticulum is started, Reticulum will instead use the internal pure-pythonprimitives. A trivial consequence of this is performance, with the OpenSSLbackend being *much* faster. The most important consequence however, is thepotential loss of security by using primitives that has not seen the sameamount of scrutiny, testing and review as those from OpenSSL.If you want to use the internal pure-python primitives, it is **highlyadvisable** that you have a good understanding of the risks that this pose, andmake an informed decision on whether those risks are acceptable to you.Reticulum is relatively young software, and should be considered as such. Whileit has been built with cryptography best-practices very foremost in mind, it_has not_ been externally security audited, and there could very well beprivacy or security breaking bugs. If you want to help out, or help sponsor anaudit, please do get in touch.## Acknowledgements &amp; CreditsReticulum can only exist because of the mountain of Open Source work it wasbuilt on top of, the contributions of everyone involved, and everyone that hassupported the project through the years.
