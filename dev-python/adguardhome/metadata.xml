It is mainly created to allow third-party programs to automatethe behavior of AdGuard.An excellent example of this might be Home Assistant, which allows you to writeautomations, to turn on parental controls when the kids get home.## Installation```bashpip install adguardhome```## Usage```pythonfrom adguardhome import AdGuardHomeimport asyncioasync def main():    &quot;&quot;&quot;Show example how to get status of your AdGuard Home instance.&quot;&quot;&quot;    async with AdGuardHome(&quot;192.168.1.2&quot;) as adguard:        version = await adguard.version()        print(&quot;AdGuard version:&quot;, version)        active = await adguard.protection_enabled()        active = &quot;Yes&quot; if active else &quot;No&quot;        print(&quot;Protection enabled?&quot;, active)        if not active:            print(&quot;AdGuard Home protection disabled. Enabling...&quot;)            await adguard.enable_protection()if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    asyncio.run(main())```## Changelog &amp; ReleasesThis repository keeps a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]functionality. The format of the log is based on[Keep a Changelog][keepchangelog].Releases are based on [Semantic Versioning][semver], and use the formatof `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. In a nutshell, the version will be incrementedbased on the following:- `MAJOR`: Incompatible or major changes.- `MINOR`: Backwards-compatible new features and enhancements.- `PATCH`: Backwards-compatible bugfixes and package updates.## ContributingThis is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want touse the code or contribute to it.We've set up a separate document for our[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:## Setting up development environmentThis Python project is fully managed using the [Poetry][poetry] dependencymanager. But also relies on the use of NodeJS for certain checks duringdevelopment.You need at least:- Python 3.11+- [Poetry][poetry-install]- NodeJS 20+ (including NPM)To install all packages, including all development requirements:```bashnpm installpoetry install```As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changesare linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and testsmanually, using the following command:```bashpoetry run pre-commit run --all-files```To run just the Python tests:```bashpoetry run pytest```## Authors &amp; contributorsThe original setup of this repository is by [Franck Nijhof][frenck].For a full list of all authors and contributors,check [the contributor's page][contributors].## LicenseMIT LicenseCopyright (c) 2019-2023 Franck NijhofPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
