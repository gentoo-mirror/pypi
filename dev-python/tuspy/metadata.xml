Resumable&gt; means that an upload can be interrupted at any moment and can be resumed without&gt; re-uploading the previous data again. An interruption may happen willingly, if&gt; the user wants to pause, or by accident in case of a network issue or server&gt; outage.**tus-py-client** is a Python client for uploading files using the *tus* protocol to any remote server supporting it.## DocumentationSee documentation here: http://tus-py-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/## Get started```bashpip install tuspy```Now you are ready to use the api.``` pythonfrom tusclient import client# Set Authorization headers if it is required# by the tus server.my_client = client.TusClient('http://tusd.tusdemo.net/files/',                              headers={'Authorization': 'Basic xxyyZZAAbbCC='})# Set more headers.my_client.set_headers({'HEADER_NAME': 'HEADER_VALUE'})uploader = my_client.uploader('path/to/file.ext', chunk_size=200)# A file stream may also be passed in place of a file path.fs = open('path/to/file.ext')uploader = my_client.uploader(file_stream=fs, chunk_size=200)# Upload a chunk i.e 200 bytes.uploader.upload_chunk()# Uploads the entire file.# This uploads chunk by chunk.uploader.upload()# you could increase the chunk size to reduce the# number of upload_chunk cycles.uploader.chunk_size = 800uploader.upload()# Continue uploading chunks till total chunks uploaded reaches 1000 bytes.uploader.upload(stop_at=1000)```If the upload url is known and the client headers are not required, uploaders can also be used standalone.``` pythonfrom tusclient.uploader import Uploadermy_uploader = Uploader('path/to/file.ext',                       url='http://tusd.tusdemo.net/files/abcdef123456',                       chunk_size=200)```## LicenseMIT</longdescription>
