	<longdescription>=======Read me=======Dennis is a set of utilities for working with PO files to ease development andimprove quality. Translate POT files to find problems with localization in yourcode. Lint PO files for common problems like variable formatting, mismatchedHTML, missing variables, etc.``dennis-cmd`` has the following subcommands:* **lint**: Lints PO and POT files for problems including errors that can cause  your production system to crash and problems in strings that can lead to poor  translations.  The system allows for defining other variable formats.* **status**: Get a high-level status of a PO file including a list of  unstranslated strings.* **translate**: Translates strings in PO files into something else! Comes with  an HTML extractor (tokenizes strings so that only the text is translated) and  a bunch of translations like Pirate!.  This is helpful for l10n testing, development, finding unicode/layout  problems, amazing your friends, hilarious April 1st shenanigans, etc.  Specify the tokenizer/transform pipeline you want to use that combines  things. Zombie? Sure! Shouty Zombie? Ok! Manic shouty Dubstep? Bring it on!  This also works on strings passed in as command line arguments and as  stdin---it doesn't have to be a PO file or in a PO format format. For  example, Dennis uses Dennis to translate all Dennis commit messages into  Pirate!. That's how cool Dennis is!Quick start===========Install::    $ pip install dennisLint a PO file for problems::    $ dennis-cmd lint locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/messages.poLint all your PO files for errors::    $ dennis-cmd lint --errorsonly locale/Lint a POT file for problems::    $ dennis-cmd lint locale/templates/LC_MESSAGES/messages.potTranslate a PO file in place into Pirate!::    $ dennis-cmd translate --pipeline=html,pirate \        locale/xx/LC_MESSAGES/messages.poGet help::    $ dennis-cmdProject details===============:Code:          https://github.com/mozilla/dennis:Documentation: https://dennis.readthedocs.io/:Issue tracker: https://github.com/mozilla/dennis/issues:License:       BSD 3-clause; see LICENSE fileWhy is it called Dennis?========================This is how @willkg names his software projects.</longdescription>
