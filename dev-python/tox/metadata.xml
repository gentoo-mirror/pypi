It is part of a larger vision of easing the packaging, testingand release process of Python software (alongside [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and[devpi](https://www.devpi.net)).tox is a generic virtual environment management and test command line tool you can use for:- checking your package builds and installs correctly under different environments (such as different Python  implementations, versions or installation dependencies),- running your tests in each of the environments with the test tool of choice,- acting as a frontend to continuous integration servers, greatly reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based  testing.Please read our [user guide](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/user_guide.html#basic-example) for an example and more detailedintroduction, or watch [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFqna5ilqig) that presents the problem spaceand how tox solves it.</longdescription>
