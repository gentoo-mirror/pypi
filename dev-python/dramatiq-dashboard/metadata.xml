	<longdescription># dramatiq_dashboardA dashboard for [dramatiq], specific to its Redis broker (sorryRabbitMQ users!).  Very alpha stuff.It comes in the form of a WSGI middleware, with as few dependencies aspossible (`dramatiq`, `jinja2` and `redis`) so it's super easy to pluginto whatever web application you have.![screencast](https://media.defn.io/dramatiq-dashboard-screencast.gif)## Installation    pip install dramatiq_dashboard## Quickstart#### Run the dashboard on top of an existing WSGI app```python# Assuming at some point you instantiate your app.app = create_wsgi_application()# Import the library, create the middleware and wrap your app with it.import dramatiq_dashboarddashboard_middleware = dramatiq_dashboard.make_wsgi_middleware(&quot;/drama&quot;)app = dashboard_middleware(app)```Run your app, visit `/drama` and you should see the dashboard.#### Run the dashboard as a standalone webserverIf you don't want to wrap an existing WSGI app, you can also run thedashboard as a standalone server.  Install the WSGI server of yourchoice (e.g. uWSGi, gunicorn, bjoern, etc), setup the Redis broker,and then start `DashboardApp` directly.For example, to serve the dashboard on `http://127.0.0.1:8080` usingthe `bjoern` WSGI server and a redis server on `17.0.0.1:6379`, runthe following:```pythonimport bjoernimport dramatiqfrom dramatiq.brokers.redis import RedisBrokerfrom dramatiq_dashboard import DashboardAppbroker = RedisBroker(host=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, port=6379)broker.declare_queue(&quot;default&quot;)dramatiq.set_broker(broker)app = DashboardApp(broker=broker, prefix=&quot;&quot;)bjoern.run(app, &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, 8080)```Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ to see the running dashboard.*Note that if you use custom queues in your application, they won't bediscovered using this approach.  You'll have to either add each one ofthem manually to your broker or import and pass your application'sbroker to `DashboardApp`.*## Licensedramatiq_dashboard is licensed under the LGPL.
