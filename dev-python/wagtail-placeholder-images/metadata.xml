	<longdescription>[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/wagtail-placeholder-images.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/wagtail-placeholder-images)# wagtial placeholder imagesThis is a package for using placeholder images when developing which can be useful if you're storing them on a server and don't want to download them or link directly to the server when working locally.## InstallationFirst download the package:```shpip install wagtail-placeholder-images```Then there's two options. If you're using your own custom image model you can use `PlaceholderRenditionMixin` like so:```pythonfrom wagtail.images.models import AbstractImagefrom wagtail_placeholder_images.mixins import PlaceholderRenditionMixinclass CustomImage(PlaceholderRenditionMixin, AbstractImage):    admin_form_fields = Image.admin_form_fields + (        # Then add the field names here to make them appear in the form:        # 'caption',    )```If you're using the standard Wagtail Image model you can monkey patch it:```pythonfrom wagtail.images.models import AbstractImagefrom wagtail_placeholder_images.mixins import PlaceholderRenditionMixinAbstractImage.get_placeholder_rendition = PlaceholderRenditionMixin.get_placeholder_renditionAbstractImage.get_rendition = PlaceholderRenditionMixin.get_rendition```Then you have to set `WAGTAIL_PLACEHOLDERIMAGES_DUMMY` to `True` and use your desired placeholder source by setting `WAGTAIL_PLACEHOLDERIMAGES_SOURCE`. This should be done in your development settings file, so this doesn't get enabled on your servers. E.g.```python# settings_dev.pyWAGTAIL_PLACEHOLDERIMAGES_DUMMY = TrueWAGTAIL_PLACEHOLDERIMAGES_SOURCE = &quot;//placedog.net/{width}/{height}/&quot;```That should be it!</longdescription>
