	<longdescription>PuDB: a console-based visual debugger for Python================================================.. image:: https://gitlab.tiker.net/inducer/pudb/badges/main/pipeline.svg    :alt: Gitlab Build Status    :target: https://gitlab.tiker.net/inducer/pudb/commits/main.. image:: https://github.com/inducer/pudb/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main&amp;event=push    :alt: Github Build Status    :target: https://github.com/inducer/pudb/actions?query=branch%3Amain+workflow%3ACI+event%3Apush.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/pudb.png    :alt: Python Package Index Release Page    :target: https://pypi.org/project/pudb/Its goal is to provide all the niceties of modern GUI-based debuggers in amore lightweight and keyboard-friendly package. PuDB allows you to debug coderight where you write and test it--in a terminal.Here are some screenshots:* Light theme  .. image:: doc/images/pudb-screenshot-light.png* Dark theme  .. image:: doc/images/pudb-screenshot-dark.pngYou may watch screencasts too:* `Meet Pudb, a debugger for Python code (2020) &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJYkCWPs_UU&gt;`_* `PuDB Intro Screencast (2009) &lt;http://vimeo.com/5255125&gt;`_Features--------* Syntax-highlighted source, the stack, breakpoints and variables are all  visible at once and continuously updated. This helps you be more aware of  what's going on in your program. Variable displays can be expanded, collapsed  and have various customization options.* Pre-bundled themes, including dark themes via &quot;Ctrl-P&quot;. Could set a custom theme also.* Simple, keyboard-based navigation using single keystrokes makes debugging  quick and easy. PuDB understands cursor-keys and Vi shortcuts for navigation.  Other keys are inspired by the corresponding pdb commands.* Use search to find relevant source code, or use &quot;m&quot; to invoke the module  browser that shows loaded modules, lets you load new ones and reload existing  ones.* Breakpoints can be set just by pointing at a source line and hitting &quot;b&quot; and  then edited visually in the breakpoints window.  Or hit &quot;t&quot; to run to the line  under the cursor.* Drop to a Python shell in the current environment by pressing &quot;!&quot;.  Or open a command prompt alongside the source-code via &quot;Ctrl-X&quot;.* PuDB places special emphasis on exception handling. A post-mortem mode makes  it easy to retrace a crashing program's last steps.* Ability to control the debugger from a separate terminal.* IPython integration (see `wiki &lt;http://wiki.tiker.net/PuDB&gt;`_)* Should work with Python 3.6 and newer. (Versions 2019.2 and older continue  to support Python 2.7.)Links-----`PuDB documentation &lt;https://documen.tician.de/pudb&gt;`_PuDB also has a `mailing list &lt;http://lists.tiker.net/listinfo/pudb&gt;`_ thatyou may use to submit patches and requests for help.  You can also send a pullrequest to the `GitHub repository &lt;https://github.com/inducer/pudb&gt;`_Development Version-------------------You may obtain the development version using the `Git &lt;http://git-scm.org/&gt;`_version control tool.::    git clone https://github.com/inducer/pudb.gitYou may also `browse the code &lt;https://github.com/inducer/pudb&gt;`_ online.</longdescription>
