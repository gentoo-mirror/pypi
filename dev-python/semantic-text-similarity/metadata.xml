	<longdescription># semantic-text-similarityan easy-to-use interface to fine-tuned BERT models for computing semantic similarity. that's it.This project contains an interface to fine-tuned, BERT-based semantic text similarity models. It modifies [pytorch-transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-transformers) by abstracting away all the research benchmarking code for ease of real-world applicability.| Model             |          Dataset | Dev.

Try clearing this folder if you have issues.# AcknowledgementClinical models in this project were submitted to the 2019 N2C2 Shared Task Track 1.Implementation and model training in this project was supported by funding from the Mark Dredze Lab at Johns Hopkins University.</longdescription>
