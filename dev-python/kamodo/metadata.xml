CCMC's Kamodo readers may be found here [https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Kamodo/](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Kamodo/)## UsageSuppose we have a vector field defined by a function of positions in the x-y plane:```pythonfrom kamodo import kamodofyimport numpy as npx = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 25)y = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 30)xx, yy = np.meshgrid(x,y)points = np.array(list(zip(xx.ravel(), yy.ravel())))@kamodofy(units = 'km/s')def fvec(rvec = points):    ux = np.sin(rvec[:,0])    uy = np.cos(rvec[:,1])    return np.vstack((ux,uy)).T```The @kamodofy decorator lets us register this field with units to enable unit-conversion downstream:```pythonfrom kamodo import Kamodokamodo = Kamodo(fvec = fvec)kamodo```When run in a jupyter notebook, the above kamodo object will render as a set of equations:$$\vec{f}{\left (\vec{r} \right )} [km/s] = \lambda{\left (\vec{r} \right )}$$We can now evaluate our function using dot notation:```pythonkamodo.fvec(np.array([[-1,1]]))``````consolearray([[-0.84147098,  0.54030231]])```We can perform unit conversion by function composition:```pythonkamodo['gvec[m/s]'] = 'fvec'```kamodo automatically generates the appropriate multiplicative factors:$$\vec{g}{\left (\vec{r} \right )} [m/s] = 1000 \vec{f}{\left (\vec{r} \right )}$$we can verify these results through evaluation```pythonkamodo.gvec(np.array([[-1,1]]))``````consolearray([[-841.47098481,  540.30230587]])```Kamodo also generates quick-look graphics via function inspection.```pythonimport plotly.io as piofig = kamodo.plot('fvec')pio.write_image(fig, 'images/fig2d-usage.svg')```![usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnsembleGovServices/kamodo-core/joss/docs/notebooks/images/fig2d-usage.svg)Head over to the [Introduction](notebooks/Kamodo.ipynb) page for more details.## Getting startedKamodo may be installed from pip```consolepip install kamodo```Kamodo is now maintained by Ensemble Government Services. To get the latest version, install from the Ensemble git repo:```consolepip install git+https://github.com/EnsembleGovServices/kamodo-core.git```### Kamodo EnvironmentWe strongly recommend using the conda environment system to avoid library conflicts with your host machine's python.Download and install miniconda from [here](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). The advantage to using miniconda is that each new environment includes the bare-minimum for a project. This allows you to keep many different projects on a single work station.#### Create Kamodo environmentCreate a new environment for kamodo```consoleconda create -n kamodo python=3.7conda activate kamodo(kamodo) pip install kamodo```!!! note    The leading (kamodo) in your prompt indicates that you have activated the `kamodo` environment.    From here on, anything you install will be isolated to the `kamodo` environment.#### Loading example notebooksIf you want to run any of the notebooks in docs, you will need to install `jupyter`:```console(kamodo) conda install jupyter```Navigate to the top-level of the kamodo repo, then point jupyter to `docs/notebooks`:    (kamodo) jupyter notebook docs/notebooksThis should open a browser window that will allow you to load any of the example notebooks.#### RequirementsThe following (minimum) requirements are obtained by running `pip install kamodo`* decorator&gt;=4.4.2* numpy* scipy* sympy==1.5.1* pandas* plotly* pytest* hydra-core==0.11.3* Flask==1.1.2* flask-cors* flask-restful==0.3.8* antlr4-python3-runtime==4.7* python-forge* requests* incremental* pycapnp* pyOpenSSLThe antlr package may be necessary for rendering latex in a notebook```shconda install antlr-python-runtime```Plotly-orca may be needed for proper image export```shconda install -c plotly plotly-orca (for writing images)```!!! note    plotly version in flux## Test SuiteKamodo's unit tests are run with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/). To install pytest with code coverage```shpython -m pip install flake8 pytestpip install pytest-cov```Then, from the base of the git repo:```shpytest --cov kamodo.kamodo --cov kamodo.util --cov plotting kamodo/test_plotting.py kamodo/test_kamodo.py kamodo/test_utils.py```This will generate a test report and coverage of the `kamodo` module.To run RPC tests, you must first generate a self-signed certificate.```shpython kamodo/rpc/gen_self_signed_cert.py certfile# certfile.key and certfile.cert will be placed in your local directorypytest kamodo/rpc/test_rpc_threaded.py```</longdescription>
