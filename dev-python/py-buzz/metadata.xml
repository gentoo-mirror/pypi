This allows the user tofocus on creating a set of Exceptions that provide complete coverage for issueswithin their application without having to re-write convenience functionsthemselves.Super-quick Start----------------- - requirements: `python3.6+` - install through pip: `$ pip install py-buzz` - minimal usage example: `examples/with_buzz_class.py &lt;https://github.com/dusktreader/py-buzz/tree/master/examples/with_buzz_class.py&gt;`_Documentation-------------The complete documentation can be found at the`py-buzz home page &lt;http://py-buzz.readthedocs.io&gt;`_</longdescription>
