Cross-chain atomic swap is the cheapest and most secured by cryptographic proof to swap cryptocurrencies. It’s a brand new decentralized payment environment based on Hash Time Lock Contracts (HTLCs) protocol.## Available Cryptocurrencies, Assets &amp; TokensYou can swap the following available cryptocurrencies:| Cryptocurrencies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Networks                                            || -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------: || &lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; height=&quot;25&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movnetwork/swap/master/docs/static/svg/readme/bitcoin.svg&quot;&gt; [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) `BTC`                                                                           | `mainnet`, `testnet`                                || &lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; height=&quot;25&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movnetwork/swap/master/docs/static/svg/readme/bytom.svg&quot;&gt; [Bytom v1.0](https://github.com/bytom/bytom) `BTM` - [More Assets](https://classic.blockmeta.com/assets)                        | `mainnet`, `solonet`, `testnet`                     || &lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; height=&quot;25&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movnetwork/swap/master/docs/static/svg/readme/ethereum.svg&quot;&gt; [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) `ETH`, `ERC20` - [More Tokens](https://etherscan.io/tokens)              | `mainnet`, `ropsten`, `kovan`, `rinkeby`, `testnet` || &lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; height=&quot;25&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movnetwork/swap/master/docs/static/svg/readme/vapor.svg&quot;&gt; [Vapor](https://github.com/bytom/vapor) `BTM` - [More Assets](https://vapor.blockmeta.com/assets)                               | `mainnet`, `solonet`, `testnet`                     || &lt;img align=&quot;left&quot; height=&quot;25&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/movnetwork/swap/master/docs/static/svg/readme/xinfin.svg&quot;&gt; [XinFin](https://github.com/XinFinOrg/XDPoSChain) `XDC`, `XRC20` - [More Tokens](https://explorer.xinfin.network/tokens/xrc20) | `mainnet`, `apothem`, `testnet`                     |## What is a HTLC?A Hash Time Lock contract (HTLC) is essentially a type of payment in which two peopleagree to a financial arrangement where one party will pay the other party a certainamount of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Bytom assets. However, because thesecontracts are Time Locked, the receiving party only has a certain amount of time toaccept the payment, otherwise the money can be returned to the sender.Hash time lock contracts can help to eliminate the need for third parties in contractsbetween two parties. Third parties that are often involved in contracts are lawyers,banks, etc. Lawyers are often required to draw up contracts, and banks are oftenrequired to help store money and then transfer it to the receiving party in the contract.With hash time lock contracts, two parties could hypothetically set up contracts andtransfer money without the need for third parties. This is because the sending partycould create the conditional payment, and then the receiving party could agree to it,receive it, and help validate the transaction in the process.This could potentially revolutionize the way that many businesses interact with one anotherand dramatically speed up the time that it takes for business deals to be set up.## How do HTLC work?The way that Hash Time Lock Contracts work is that the person who will be making the paymentsets up a specific hash, which represents the amount of money that will be paid. To receivethe payment, the recipient will have to create a cryptographic proof of payment, and he orshe will have to do this within the specified amount of time. The amount of time that therecipient has to accept the payment can vary significantly from one Time Locked contract tothe next. If the recipient meets the deadline, then the money will be theirs, if he or shefails to meet the deadline, it won’t. So, there is an often a lot at stake when it comes tomeeting deadlines from hash Time Locked contracts, when cryptocurrencies are being exchanged.A Hash Time Lock Contract or HTLC is a class of payments that uses Hash Locked and Time Lockedto require that the receiver of a payment either acknowledge receiving the payment prior to adeadline by generating cryptographic proof of payment or forfeit the ability to claim the payment,returning(refunding) it to the payer.Hash Time Lock Contracts (HTLCs) allow payments to be securely routed across multiple paymentchannels which is super important because it is not optimal for a person to open a payment channelwith everyone he/she is transacting with.- **Hash Locked** · A Hash Locked functions like “two-factor authentication” (2FA). It requires the intended recipientto provide the correct secret passphrase to claim the funds.- **Time Locked** · A Time Locked adds a “timeout” expiration date to a payment. It requires the intended recipient toclaim the funds prior to the expiry. Otherwise, the transaction defaults to enabling the originalsender of funds to claim a refund.## Benefits of HTLCs There are many benefits to these types of contracts. First, because they are time sensitive, itprevents the person who is making the payment from having to wait indefinitely to find out whetheror not his or her payment goes through. Second, the person who makes the payment will not have towaste his or her money if the payment is not accepted. It will simply be returned.- **Time Sensitivity** · The time sensitive nature of the transaction prevents the sender from havingto wait forever to find out whether their payment went through. If the time runs out, the funds willjust be sent back to the sender, so they don’t have to worry and can wait for the process to unfold.- **Trustless system** · As is the case with all smart contracts, trust is not needed as the rules arealready coded into the contract itself. Hash Time Lock Contracts take this one step further byimplementing a time limit for recipients to acknowledge the payment.- **Validation of the Blockchain** · Transactions are validated because of the cryptographic proof ofpayment required by the receiver.- **Private Information's** · There are no complicated account setups or KYC/AML restrictions. Tradedirectly from your wallet with a counterparty of your choice. Only the parties involved know thedetails of the trade.- **Trading across multiple Cryptocurrencies** · HTLC makes Cross-chain transactions easier and moresecure than ever. Cross chain transactions are the next step in the evolution of cryptocurrencyadoption. The easier it becomes to unite the hundreds of blockchain's that currently exist insilos, the faster the technology as a whole can begin to scale and achieve mass adoption.For more read the [documentation](https://swap.readthedocs.io).| Hash Time Lock Contracts (HTLCs)       | Scripts                                                                                                           ||:-------------------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: || Bitcoin: native BTC coin               | [htlc.script](https://github.com/movnetwork/swap/blob/master/swap/providers/bitcoin/contracts/htlc.script)        || Bytom v1.0: native BTM and more assets | [htlc.equity](https://github.com/movnetwork/swap/blob/master/swap/providers/bytom/contracts/htlc.equity)          || Ethereum: native ETH coin              | [htlc.sol](https://github.com/movnetwork/swap/blob/master/swap/providers/ethereum/contracts/htlc.sol)             || Ethereum for ERC20 tokens              | [htlc-erc20.sol](https://github.com/movnetwork/swap/blob/master/swap/providers/ethereum/contracts/htlc-erc20.sol) || Vapor: native BTM and more assets      | [htlc.equity](https://github.com/movnetwork/swap/blob/master/swap/providers/vapor/contracts/htlc.equity)          || XinFin: native XDC coin                | [htlc.sol](https://github.com/movnetwork/swap/blob/master/swap/providers/xinfin/contracts/htlc.sol)               || XinFin for XRC20 tokens                | [htlc-xrc20.sol](https://github.com/movnetwork/swap/blob/master/swap/providers/xinfin/contracts/htlc-xrc20.sol)   |## InstallationPIP to install Swap globally, for Linux `sudo` may be required:```pip install swap```If you want to run the latest version of the code, you can install from git:```pip install git+git://github.com/meherett/swap.git```For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/meherett/swap/tags).## DevelopmentWe welcome pull requests.
