Run your tests normally:    pytestIf you would like more detailed output (one test per line), then you may use the verbose option:    pytest --verboseIf you would like to run tests without pytest-sugar, use:    pytest -p no:sugar## How to contribute üë∑‚ôÇÔ∏è[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&amp;ref=master&amp;repo=10950375)Make sure to read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Teemu/pytest-sugar/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). You can get started modifying the codebase with the following commands. Alternatively, you can try Github Codespaces (click the badge above). Push the changes to your repository &amp; create a pull request.````git clone git@github.com:Teemu/pytest-sugar.gitcd pytest-sugarpython -m venv .venvsource .venv/bin/activateecho &quot;.venv&quot; &gt;&gt; .git/info/excludepip install -e &quot;.[dev]&quot;pre-commit install````There are two ways of running tests. We have our proper tests:````pytest .````There are also fake tests that can be used to visualise the output:````pytest faketests````When submitting a pull request, please add a `RELEASE.md` file in the root of the project that contains the release type (major, minor, patch) and a summary of the changes that will be used as the release changelog entry. For example:```markdownRelease type: patchFor long-running tests, display minutes and not only seconds.```## RequirementsYou will need the following prerequisites in order to use pytest-sugar:- Python 3.8 or newer- pytest 6.2 or newer## Running on WindowsIf you are seeing gibberish, you might want to try changing charset and fonts.
