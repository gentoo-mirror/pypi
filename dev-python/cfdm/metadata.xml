	<longdescription>The **cfdm** Python package is a reference implementation of the `CFdata model &lt;https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/10/4619/2017&gt;`_ for CF-1.10, thatidentifies the fundamental elements of the `CF conventions&lt;http://cfconventions.org/&gt;`_ and shows how they relate to each other,independently of the `netCDF&lt;https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/&gt;`_ encoding.The central element defined by the CF data model is the **fieldconstruct**, which corresponds to a CF-netCDF data variable with allof its metadata.A simple example of reading a field construct from a file andinspecting it:    &gt;&gt;&gt; import cfdm    &gt;&gt;&gt; f = cfdm.read('file.nc')    &gt;&gt;&gt; f    [&lt;Field: air_temperature(time(12), latitude(64), longitude(128)) K&gt;]    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(f[0])    Field: air_temperature (ncvar%tas)    ----------------------------------    Data            : air_temperature(time(12), latitude(64), longitude(128)) K    Cell methods    : time(12): mean (interval: 1.0 month)    Dimension coords: time(12) = [0450-11-16 00:00:00, ..., 0451-10-16 12:00:00] noleap                    : latitude(64) = [-87.8638, ..., 87.8638] degrees_north                    : longitude(128) = [0.0, ..., 357.1875] degrees_east                    : height(1) = [2.0] mThe **cfdm** package can* read field and domain constructs from netCDF and CDL datasets,* create new field and domain constructs in memory,* write and append field and domain constructs to netCDF datasets on disk,* read, write, and create coordinates defined by geometry cells,* read and write netCDF4 string data-type variables,* read, write, and create netCDF and CDL datasets containing hierarchical groups,* inspect field and domain constructs,* test whether two constructs are the same,* modify field and domain construct metadata and data,* create subspaces of field and domain constructs,* incorporate, and create, metadata stored in external files, and* read, write, and create data that have been compressed by convention  (i.e. ragged or gathered arrays, or coordinate arrays compressed  by subsampling), whilst presenting a view of the data in its  uncompressed form.Documentation=============https://ncas-cms.github.io/cfdmTutorial========https://ncas-cms.github.io/cfdm/tutorialInstallation============https://ncas-cms.github.io/cfdm/installationCommand line utility====================During installation the `cfdump` command line tool is also installed,which generates text descriptions of the field constructs containedin a netCDF dataset.Source code===========This project is hosted in a `GitHub repository&lt;https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cfdm&gt;`_ where you can access the mostup-to-date source.</longdescription>
