Telescopes whichcollect data as timestreams rather than images give us a unique set of analysischallenges. Detector data usually contains noise which is correlated in time as well assources of correlated signal from the instrument and the environment. Large pieces ofdata must often be analyzed simultaneously to extract an estimate of the sky signal.## DocumentationSee the full documentation here:https://toast-cmb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</longdescription>
