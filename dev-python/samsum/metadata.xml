Usage could be:```pythonfrom samsum import commandssam=&quot;/home/user/reads_to_genome.sam&quot;fasta=&quot;/home/user/genome.fasta&quot;ref_seq_abunds = commands.ref_sequence_abundances(aln_file=sam, seq_file=fasta, min_aln=10, p_cov=0, map_qual=0)```The `ref_seq_abunds` object is a dictionary of `RefSequence` instances indexed by their header/sequence names.`RefSequence` objects have several variables that are of interest:-   `self.name` is the name of the (reference) sequence or header-   `self.length` is the length (in base-pairs) of the sequence-   `self.reads_mapped` is the number of reads that were mapped-   `self.weight_total` is the number of fragments (float) that were mapped to the sequence-   `self.fpkm` is Fragments Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads-   `self.tpm` is Transcripts Per Million mapped reads## OutputsIf `samsum stats` was executed, a &quot;samsum_log.txt&quot; file is written to the current working directory (i.e. where `samsum` was executed from). A comma-separated value (CSV) file with the fields  &quot;QueryName&quot;, &quot;RefSequence&quot;, &quot;ProportionCovered&quot;, &quot;Coverage&quot;, &quot;Fragments&quot;, &quot;FPKM&quot; and &quot;TPM&quot; is written to a file path specified on the command-line, or by default &quot;samsum_table.csv&quot;.  A TSV file can be written instead if the `sep` argument was modified to 'tab'.</longdescription>
