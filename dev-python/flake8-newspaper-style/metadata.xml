	<longdescription># Enforce Newspaper Style with Flake## MotivationGood code reads like a newspaper. Start with the highest abstraction, go to the details.This also enables to read the code without an editor.Quoting Robert C. Martin from his Clean Code book.“Think of a well-written newspaper article. You read it vertically. At the top you expect a headline that will tell you what the story is about and allows you to decide whether it is something you want to read. The first paragraph gives you a synopsis of the whole story, hiding all the details while giving you the broad-brush concepts. As you continue downward, the details increase until you have all the dates, names, quotes, claims, and other minutia.”In Python newspaper code should look like this.```pydef headline():    text()def text():  # this needs to be defined after the usage.    ...```There hasn't been an automatic way in python to check for this. So here it is.## Usage```py# install the flake8 extension for newspaper stylepip3 install flake8-newspaper-style==0.4.2# then check your codeflake8 --select=NEW src  # here it restricts flake8 to newspaper style issues```## References - Clean Code book by Robert C.
