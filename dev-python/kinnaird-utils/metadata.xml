	<longdescription># kinnaird-utilsMy personal helper methods.[https://github.com/kmcquade/kinnaird-utils](https://github.com/kmcquade/kinnaird-utils)[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/kinnaird-utils)](https://pepy.tech/project/kinnaird-utils)## MotivationI forget how to do plenty of Python things regularly that I have solved before and find myself wasting time looking through old code to figure out how I did something in the past. I am storing some helper methods in this package, so I can use them during rapid development of stuff.## Process* Use this package when developing rapidly* When I have my tools in a more usable state, I can eliminate the tool's dependency on `kinnaird-utils` by simply copying over the helper methods to the tool I am working on.</longdescription>
