Secondarily, it can be used for **recognizing arbitrary structures** that can be described by Python's typing system.Please see [Philosophy] for more information about how trycastdiffers from similar libraries like pydantic.[Philosophy]: https://github.com/davidfstr/trycast/wiki/Philosophy### Why use TypedDict?Why use typed dictionaries to represent data structures instead of classes,named tuples, or other formats?Typed dictionaries are the natural form that JSON data comes in over the wire.They can be trivially serialized and deserialized without any additional logic.For applications that use a lot of JSON data - such as web applications - using typed dictionaries is very convenient for representing data structures.If you just need a lightweight class structure that doesn't need excellentsupport for JSON-serialization you might consider other alternatives forrepresenting data structures in Python such as [dataclasses] (**recommended**),[named tuples], [attrs], or plain classes.[dataclasses]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/#abstract[named tuples]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple[attrs]: https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/## Installation```shellpython -m pip install trycast```## Recommendations while using trycast- So that `trycast()` can recognize TypedDicts with mixed required and  not-required keys correctly:    * Use Python 3.9+ if possible.    * Prefer using `typing.TypedDict`, unless you must use Python 3.8.      In Python 3.8 prefer `typing_extensions.TypedDict` instead.    * Avoid using `mypy_extensions.TypedDict` in general.## Presentations &amp; VideosA presentation about **using trycast to parse JSON** was given at the2021 PyCon US Typing Summit:[![2021 PyCon US Typing Summit Presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidfstr/trycast/main/README/TypingSummit2021_Presentation_FirstSlide.png)](https://youtu.be/ld9rwCvGdhc?t=1782)A presentation describing **tools that use Python type annotations at runtime**,including trycast, was given at the 2022 PyCon US Typing Summit:[![2022 PyCon US Typing Summit Presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidfstr/trycast/main/README/TypingSummit2022_Presentation_FirstSlide.png)](https://youtu.be/CmXQOoiMy-g)## ContributingPull requests are welcome!
