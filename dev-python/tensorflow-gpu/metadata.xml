Please install tensorflow instead.The tensorflow package supports GPU accelerated operations via Nvidia CUDA.## Removal Informationtensorflow and tensorflow-gpu have been the same package since TensorFlow2.1, released in September 2019. Although the checksums differ due to metadata,they were built in the same way and both provide GPU support via Nvidia CUDA.As of December 2022, tensorflow-gpu has been removed and has been replaced withthis new, empty package that generates an error upon installation.All existing versions of tensorflow-gpu are still available, but theTensorFlow team has stopped releasing any new tensorflow-gpu packages, andwill not release any patches for existing tensorflow-gpu versions.## About this packageThis simple package raises a warning if setup.py is executed as part of apackage installation.
