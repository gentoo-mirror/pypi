But please help out in adding more languages! It'svery easy, you don't even need to be a programmer.Some languages...* Just need a little push, as they are almost fully complete* Got initiatied and need a new instigator to carry on the ambitions* Do not exist yet - but you can request them and become the coordinator.`Visit the django-wiki project on Transifex &lt;https://www.transifex.com/django-wiki/django-wiki/&gt;`__Demo----A demo running the latest ``master`` is available here, sign up for anaccount to see the notification system, or you can log in withuser:``test`` and password:``test``.https://demo.django-wiki.orgCommunity---------Please use our IRC or mailing list (google group) for getting in touchon development and support. Please do not email developers asking forpersonal support.- #django-wiki on irc.freenode.net- `django-wiki@googlegroups.com &lt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-wiki&gt;`__- `twitter:djangowiki &lt;https://twitter.com/djangowiki&gt;`__*THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRE...*-----------------------------Currently, the model API is subject to smaller changes, and the pluginAPI seems pretty stable.In order to customize the wiki, best idea is to override templates and createyour own template tags. Do not make your own hard copy of this repository inorder to fiddle with internal parts of the wiki -- this strategy will lead youto lose out on future updates with highly improved features and plugins.Possibly security updates as well!The release cycle has already begun, so you can administer django-wikithrough Pypi and pip.All views are class-based, however don't take it as an encouragement toextend them, unless you are prepared to modify both templates and viewclasses every time there is an update.Contributing------------Please read our`Developer Guide &lt;https://django-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/index.html&gt;`__Manifesto---------Django needs a mature wiki system appealing to all kinds of needs, bothbig and small:-  **Be pluggable and light-weight.** Don't integrate optional features   in the core.-  **Be open.** Make an extension API that allows the ecology of the   wiki to grow in a structured way. Wikipedia consists of over `1100   extension projects &lt;https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/diffusion/query/all/?after=1100&gt;`__   written for MediaWiki. We should learn from this.-  **Be smart.** `This   is &lt;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/MediaWiki_1.24.1_database_schema.svg&gt;`__   the map of tables in MediaWiki - we'll understand the choices of   other wiki projects and make our own. After-all, this is a Django   project.-  **Be simple.** The source code should *almost* explain itself.-  **Be structured.** Markdown is a simple syntax for readability.   Features should be implemented either through easy coding patterns in   the content field, but rather stored in a structured way (in the   database) and managed through a friendly interface. This gives   control back to the website developer, and makes knowledge more   usable. Just ask: Why has Wikipedia never changed? Answer: Because   it's knowledge is stored in a complicated way, thus it becomes very   static.Docs----See the docs/ folder, or read them at:https://django-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/If you wish to add something, please ask in the google group or raise anissue if you're in doubt about whether something might change.Background----------Django-wiki is a rewrite of`django-simplewiki &lt;https://code.google.com/p/django-simple-wiki/&gt;`__, aproject from 2009 that aimed to be a base system for a wiki. It proposedthat the user should customize the wiki by overwriting templates, butsoon learned that the only customization that really took place was thatpeople forked the entire project. We don't want that for django-wiki, wewant it to be modular and extendable.As of now, Django has existed for too long without a proper wikiapplication. The dream of django-wiki is to become a contestantalongside Mediawiki, so that Django developers can stick to the Djangoplatform even when facing tough challenges such as implementing a wiki.Q&amp;A----  **Why is the module named just** ``wiki`` **?** Because when we tried   ``pip install wiki``, it returned &quot;No distributions at all found   for wiki&quot;, so we had to make up for that!-  **What markup language will you use?**   `Markdown &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown&gt;`__. The markup   renderer is not a pluggable part but has been internalized into core   parts. Discussion should go here:   https://github.com/django-wiki/django-wiki/issues/76-  **Why not use django-reversion?** It's a great project, but if the   wiki has to grow ambitious, someone will have to optimize its   behavior, and using a third-party application for something as   crucial as the revision system is a no-go in this regard.-  **Any support for multiple wikis?** Yes, in an sense you can just   imagine that you always have multiple wikis, because you always have   hierarchies and full control of their permissions. See this   discussion: https://github.com/django-wiki/django-wiki/issues/63Requirements------------Please refer to current release to see exact version dependencies.
