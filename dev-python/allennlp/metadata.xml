That means we are no longer adding new features or upgrading dependencies. We will still respond to questions and address bugs as they arise up until December 16th, 2022. If you have any concerns or are interested in maintaining AllenNLP going forward, please open an issue on this repository.AllenNLP has been a big success, but as the field is advancing quickly it's time to focus on new initiatives. We're working hard to make [AI2 Tango](https://github.com/allenai/tango) the best way to organize research codebases. If you are an active user of AllenNLP, here are some suggested alternatives:* If you like the trainer, the configuration language, or are simply looking for a better way to manage your experiments, check out [AI2 Tango](https://github.com/allenai/tango).* If you like AllenNLP's `modules` and `nn` packages, check out [delmaksym/allennlp-light](https://github.com/delmaksym/allennlp-light). It's even compatible with [AI2 Tango](https://github.com/allenai/tango)!* If you like the framework aspect of AllenNLP, check out [flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair). It has multiple state-of-art NLP models and allows you to easily use pretrained embeddings such as those from transformers.* If you like the AllenNLP metrics package, check out [torchmetrics](https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). It has the same API as AllenNLP, so it should be a quick learning curve to make the switch.* If you want to vectorize text, try [the transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).* If you want to maintain the AllenNLP Fairness or Interpret components, please get in touch. There is no alternative to it, so we are looking for a dedicated maintainer.* If you are concerned about other AllenNLP functionality, please create an issue. Maybe we can find another way to continue supporting your use case.## Quick Links- ‚ÜóÔ∏è [Website](https://allennlp.org/)- üî¶ [Guide](https://guide.allennlp.org/)- üñº [Gallery](https://gallery.allennlp.org)- üíª [Demo](https://demo.allennlp.org)- üìì [Documentation](https://docs.allennlp.org/) ( [latest](https://docs.allennlp.org/latest/) | [stable](https://docs.allennlp.org/stable/) | [commit](https://docs.allennlp.org/main/) )- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è [Upgrade Guide from 1.x to 2.0](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/discussions/4933)- ‚ùì [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/allennlp)- ‚úã [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)- ü§ñ [Officially Supported Models](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models)    - [Pretrained Models](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models/blob/main/allennlp_models/pretrained.py)    - [Documentation](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/) ( [latest](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/latest/) | [stable](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/stable/) | [commit](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/) )- ‚öôÔ∏è [Continuous Build](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/actions)- üåô [Nightly Releases](https://pypi.org/project/allennlp/#history)## In this README- [Getting Started Using the Library](#getting-started-using-the-library)- [Plugins](#plugins)- [Package Overview](#package-overview)- [Installation](#installation)    - [Installing via pip](#installing-via-pip)    - [Installing using Docker](#installing-using-docker)    - [Installing from source](#installing-from-source)- [Running AllenNLP](#running-allennlp)- [Issues](#issues)- [Contributions](#contributions)- [Citing](#citing)- [Team](#team)## Getting Started Using the LibraryIf you're interested in using AllenNLP for model development, we recommend you check out the[AllenNLP Guide](https://guide.allennlp.org) for a thorough introduction to the library, followed by our more advanced guideson [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/discussions/categories/guides).When you're ready to start your project, we've created a couple of template repositories that you can use as a starting place:* If you want to use `allennlp train` and config files to specify experiments, use [this  template](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-template-config-files). We recommend this approach.* If you'd prefer to use python code to configure your experiments and run your training loop, use  [this template](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-template-python-script). There are a few  things that are currently a little harder in this setup (loading a saved model, and using  distributed training), but otherwise it's functionality equivalent to the config files  setup.In addition, there are external tutorials:* [Hyperparameter optimization for AllenNLP using Optuna](https://medium.com/optuna/hyperparameter-optimization-for-allennlp-using-optuna-54b4bfecd78b)* [Training with multiple GPUs in AllenNLP](https://medium.com/ai2-blog/tutorial-how-to-train-with-multiple-gpus-in-allennlp-c4d7c17eb6d6)* [Training on larger batches with less memory in AllenNLP](https://medium.com/ai2-blog/tutorial-training-on-larger-batches-with-less-memory-in-allennlp-1cd2047d92ad)* [How to upload transformer weights and tokenizers from AllenNLP to HuggingFace](https://medium.com/ai2-blog/tutorial-how-to-upload-transformer-weights-and-tokenizers-from-allennlp-to-huggingface-ecf6c0249bf)And others on the [AI2 AllenNLP blog](https://medium.com/ai2-blog/allennlp/home).## PluginsAllenNLP supports loading &quot;plugins&quot; dynamically. A plugin is just a Python package thatprovides custom registered classes or additional `allennlp` subcommands.There is ecosystem of open source plugins, some of which are maintained by the AllenNLPteam here at AI2, and some of which are maintained by the broader community.&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt; Plugin &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt; Maintainer &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt; CLI &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt; Description &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;allennlp-models&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; AI2 &lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; No &lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; A collection of state-of-the-art models &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-semparse&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;allennlp-semparse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; AI2 &lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; No &lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; A framework for building semantic parsers &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-server&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;allennlp-server&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; AI2 &lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; Yes &lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; A simple demo server for serving models &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/himkt/allennlp-optuna&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;allennlp-optuna&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://himkt.github.io/profile/&quot;&gt;Makoto Hiramatsu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; Yes &lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://optuna.org/&quot;&gt;Optuna&lt;/a&gt; integration for hyperparameter optimization &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;AllenNLP will automatically find any official AI2-maintained plugins that you have installed,but for AllenNLP to find personal or third-party plugins you've installed,you also have to create either a local plugins file named `.allennlp_plugins`in the directory where you run the `allennlp` command, or a global plugins file at `~/.allennlp/plugins`.The file should list the plugin modules that you want to be loaded, one per line.To test that your plugins can be found and imported by AllenNLP, you can run the `allennlp test-install` command.Each discovered plugin will be logged to the terminal.For more information about plugins, see the [plugins API docs](https://docs.allennlp.org/main/api/common/plugins/). And for information on how to create a custom subcommandto distribute as a plugin, see the [subcommand API docs](https://docs.allennlp.org/main/api/commands/subcommand/).## Package Overview&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt; allennlp &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; An open-source NLP research library, built on PyTorch &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt; allennlp.commands &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; Functionality for the CLI &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt; allennlp.common &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; Utility modules that are used across the library &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt; allennlp.data &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; A data processing module for loading datasets and encoding strings as integers for representation in matrices &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt; allennlp.fairness &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; A module for bias mitigation and fairness algorithms and metrics &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt; allennlp.modules &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; A collection of PyTorch modules for use with text &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt; allennlp.nn &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; Tensor utility functions, such as initializers and activation functions &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;    &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt; allennlp.training &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;    &lt;td&gt; Functionality for training models &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;## InstallationAllenNLP requires Python 3.6.1 or later and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).We support AllenNLP on Mac and Linux environments. We presently do not support Windows but are open to contributions.### Installing via conda-forgeThe simplest way to install AllenNLP is using conda (you can choose a different python version):```conda install -c conda-forge python=3.8 allennlp```To install optional packages, such as `checklist`, use```conda install -c conda-forge allennlp-checklist```or simply install `allennlp-all` directly. The plugins mentioned above are similarly installable, e.g.```conda install -c conda-forge allennlp-models allennlp-semparse allennlp-server allennlp-optuna```### Installing via pipIt's recommended that you install the PyTorch ecosystem **before** installing AllenNLP by following the instructions on [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/).After that, just run `pip install allennlp`.&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è If you're using Python 3.7 or greater, you should ensure that you don't have the PyPI version of `dataclasses` installed after running the above command, as this could cause issues on certain platforms. You can quickly check this by running `pip freeze | grep dataclasses`. If you see something like `dataclasses=0.6` in the output, then just run `pip uninstall -y dataclasses`.If you need pointers on setting up an appropriate Python environment or would like to install AllenNLP using a different method, see below.#### Setting up a virtual environment[Conda](https://conda.io/) can be used set up a virtual environment with theversion of Python required for AllenNLP.  If you already have a Python 3environment you want to use, you can skip to the 'installing via pip' section.1.  [Download and install Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).2.  Create a Conda environment with Python 3.8 (3.7 or 3.9 would work as well):    ```    conda create -n allennlp_env python=3.8    ```3.  Activate the Conda environment. You will need to activate the Conda environment in each terminal in which you want to use AllenNLP:    ```    conda activate allennlp_env    ```#### Installing the library and dependenciesInstalling the library and dependencies is simple using `pip`.```bashpip install allennlp```To install the optional dependencies, such as `checklist`, run```bashpip install allennlp[checklist]```Or you can just install all optional dependencies with `pip install allennlp[all]`.*Looking for bleeding edge features? You can install nightly releases directly from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/allennlp/#history)*AllenNLP installs a script when you install the python package, so you can run allennlp commands just by typing `allennlp` into a terminal.  For example, you can now test your installation with `allennlp test-install`.You may also want to install `allennlp-models`, which contains the NLP constructs to train and run our officiallysupported models, many of which are hosted at [https://demo.allennlp.org](https://demo.allennlp.org).```bashpip install allennlp-models```### Installing using DockerDocker provides a virtual machine with everything set up to run AllenNLP--whether you will leverage a GPU or just run on a CPU.  Docker provides moreisolation and consistency, and also makes it easy to distribute yourenvironment to a compute cluster.AllenNLP provides [official Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/allennlp/allennlp) with the library and all of its dependencies installed.Once you have [installed Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/),you should also install the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)if you have GPUs available.Then run the following command to get an environment that will run on GPU:```bashmkdir -p $HOME/.allennlp/docker run --rm --gpus all -v $HOME/.allennlp:/root/.allennlp allennlp/allennlp:latest```You can test the Docker environment with```bashdocker run --rm --gpus all -v $HOME/.allennlp:/root/.allennlp allennlp/allennlp:latest test-install ```If you don't have GPUs available, just omit the `--gpus all` flag.#### Building your own Docker imageFor various reasons you may need to create your own AllenNLP Docker image, such as if you need a different versionof PyTorch. To do so, just run `make docker-image` from the root of your local clone of AllenNLP.By default this builds an image with the tag `allennlp/allennlp`, but you can change this to anything you wantby setting the `DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME` flag when you call `make`. For example,`make docker-image DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME=my-allennlp`.If you want to use a different version of Python or PyTorch, set the flags `DOCKER_PYTHON_VERSION` and `DOCKER_TORCH_VERSION` to something like`3.9` and `1.9.0-cuda10.2`, respectively. These flags together determine the base image that is used. You can see the list of validcombinations in this GitHub Container Registry: [github.com/allenai/docker-images/pkgs/container/pytorch](https://github.com/allenai/docker-images/pkgs/container/pytorch).After building the image you should be able to see it listed by running `docker images allennlp`.```REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZEallennlp/allennlp   latest              b66aee6cb593        5 minutes ago       2.38GB```### Installing from sourceYou can also install AllenNLP by cloning our git repository:```bashgit clone https://github.com/allenai/allennlp.git```Create a Python 3.7 or 3.8 virtual environment, and install AllenNLP in `editable` mode by running:```bashpip install -U pip setuptools wheelpip install --editable .[dev,all]```This will make `allennlp` available on your system but it will use the sources from the local cloneyou made of the source repository.You can test your installation with `allennlp test-install`.See [https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models)for instructions on installing `allennlp-models` from source.## Running AllenNLPOnce you've installed AllenNLP, you can run the command-line interfacewith the `allennlp` command (whether you installed from `pip` or from source).`allennlp` has various subcommands such as `train`, `evaluate`, and `predict`.To see the full usage information, run `allennlp --help`.You can test your installation by running  `allennlp test-install`.## IssuesEveryone is welcome to file issues with either feature requests, bug reports, or general questions.  As a small team with our own internal goals, we may ask for contributions if a prompt fix doesn't fit into our roadmap.  To keep things tidy we will often close issues we think are answered, but don't hesitate to follow up if further discussion is needed.## ContributionsThe AllenNLP team at AI2 ([@allenai](https://github.com/allenai)) welcomes contributions from the community. If you're a first time contributor, we recommend you start by reading our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.Then have a look at our issues with the tag [**`Good First Issue`**](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22).If you would like to contribute a larger feature, we recommend first creating an issue with a proposed design for discussion. This will prevent you from spending significant time on an implementation which has a technical limitation someone could have pointed out early on. Small contributions can be made directly in a pull request.Pull requests (PRs) must have one approving review and no requested changes before they are merged.  As AllenNLP is primarily driven by AI2 we reserve the right to reject or revert contributions that we don't think are good additions.## CitingIf you use AllenNLP in your research, please cite [AllenNLP: A Deep Semantic Natural Language Processing Platform](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/AllenNLP%3A-A-Deep-Semantic-Natural-Language-Platform-Gardner-Grus/a5502187140cdd98d76ae711973dbcdaf1fef46d).```bibtex@inproceedings{Gardner2017AllenNLP,  title={AllenNLP: A Deep Semantic Natural Language Processing Platform},  author={Matt Gardner and Joel Grus and Mark Neumann and Oyvind Tafjord    and Pradeep Dasigi and Nelson F.
