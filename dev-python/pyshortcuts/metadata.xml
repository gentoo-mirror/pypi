	<longdescription>Pyshortcuts helps developers and Python users to create shortcuts on aUsers Desktop or Start Menu that will run python scripts and applications.Pyshortcuts is cross-platform, supporting Windows, MacOS, and Linux each inthe way most natural for the OS.  On Windows, a Shortcut or Link iscreated.  On Linux a &quot;.desktop&quot; file is created.  On MacOS, a minimalApplication is created.  In all cases, the shortcuts are put eitherdirectly on the Desktop or Start Menu , or in a folder on the Desktop orStart Menu of the current user.  That means that there is not need forelevated permission or writing to system-level files (registry,/Applications, /usr/bin).  The user has complete control to rename, move,or delete the shortcut after it is created.  Shortcuts can have a customicon (`.ico` files on Windows or Linux, or `.icns` files on MacOS)specified, defaulting to a Python icon included with the pyshortcutsmodule. Pyshortcuts is pure python, has a small footprint and is very easyto install and use either from a python script.  That is to say, it caneasily be part of a installation (or post-installation process) process forlarger packages.</longdescription>
