Check that the environment was created$ conda env list4. Activate the new environment$ conda activate EcosizerEngineIf an environment already exits it can be removed with:$ conda remove --name EcosizerEngine --allAll the available environment can be found with:$ conda env list### Testing:From the parent directory, type$ python -m pytestThis will run all unit tests for the package### Updating Documentation:1.
