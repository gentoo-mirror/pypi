To harmonize it with other tools, now the executable is called `scenecut-extractor`. Please ensure you remove the old executable (e.g. run `which scenecut_extractor` and remove the file).Author: Werner Robitza &lt;werner.robitza@gmail.com&gt;**Contents:**- [Requirements](#requirements)- [Installation](#installation)- [Usage](#usage)- [Extended Usage](#extended-usage)- [API](#api)- [Alternatives](#alternatives)- [License](#license)## Requirements- Python 3.8 or higher- FFmpeg:    - download a static build from [their website](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html))    - put the `ffmpeg` executable in your `$PATH`## Installation```bashpip3 install --user scenecut_extractor```Or clone this repository, then run the tool with `python3 -m scenecut_extractor`.## UsageRun:```bashscenecut-extractor &lt;input-file&gt;```This might take a while depending on the length of your input file, and then output a list of scene cuts in JSON format:```json[  {    &quot;frame&quot;: 114,    &quot;pts&quot;: 114.0,    &quot;pts_time&quot;: 3.8,    &quot;score&quot;: 0.445904  },  {    &quot;frame&quot;: 159,    &quot;pts&quot;: 159.0,    &quot;pts_time&quot;: 5.3,    &quot;score&quot;: 0.440126  }]```To extract the scene cuts, use the `-x` flag and optionally specify an output directory with `-d`:```bashscenecut-extractor &lt;input-file&gt; -x -d output-directory```This will create a directory called `output-directory` and put the extracted scenes in there. The filenames will be the same as the input file, but with the scene times appended to them.**Note:** Cutting may not be frame-accurate. To be precise, you have to re-encode the video. Use the `--no-copy` flag to do this. The output will use libx264 encoding with CRF 23 to achieve a good balance between quality and file size. Future versions of this tool will allow you to specify your own encoding options.## Extended UsageThe command supports the following arguments and options, see `scenecut-extractor -h`:```usage: scenecut-extractor [-h] [-t THRESHOLD] [-o {all,frames,seconds}]                   [-of {json,csv}] [-x] [-d OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] [--no-copy]                   [-p] [-v]                   inputscenecut_extractor v0.5.0positional arguments:  input                 input fileoptions:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -t THRESHOLD, --threshold THRESHOLD                        threshold (between 0 and 1) (default: 0.3)  -o {all,frames,seconds}, --output {all,frames,seconds}                        output which information (default: all)  -of {json,csv}, --output-format {json,csv}                        output in which format (default: json)  -x, --extract         extract the scene cuts (default: False)  -d OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, --output-directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY                        Set the output directory. Default is the current                        working directory. (default: None)  --no-copy             Don't stream-copy, but re-encode the video. (default:                        False)  -p, --progress        Show a progress bar on stderr (default: False)  -v, --verbose         Print verbose info to stderr (default: False)```You can use the `-t` parameter to set the threshold that ffmpeg internally uses (between 0 and 1) – if you set it to 0, all frames will be printed with their probabilities.## APIThis program has a simple API that can be used to integrate it into other Python programs.For more information see the [API documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/slhck/scenecut-extractor/blob/master/docs/scenecut_extractor.html).## AlternativesFor extended scene detection features such as automatic splitting or perceptual hashing, you may want to check out [PySceneDetect](https://pyscenedetect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).## Licensescenecut_extractor, Copyright (c) 2018–2023 Werner RobitzaPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
