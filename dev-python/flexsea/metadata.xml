	<longdescription># FlexSEA`flexsea` is a Python package for interacting with Dephy's wearable robotic devices.It can be used for gathering data from a device or for writing your own controller.## InstallationPlease see the installation documentation [here](https://flexsea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing/index.html) for detailedinstallation instructions.## Usage### DemosA good reference for what `flexsea` is capable of is the collection of demo scriptsthat live in the `demos/` directory. The demos are numbered and should be viewed inorder, as each successive demo builds off of the information presented in the previousone. Each demo has verbose comments explaining each step.You can also find a quickstart guide [here](https://flexsea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html)## TestingYou really only need to do this if you're developing on `flexsea`. There are two typesof tests: unit tests and integration tests. Currently, the integration tests are,essentially, the same as the demos, but set up in such a way as to be more configurablefrom the command line.The easiest way to run them is:```bashcd tests/integration_tests/python3 ./test_open_control.py --help```The above command will show the required arguments for the test you've chosen to run.You'll then run the script with the necessary arguments. For the open control testreferenced above, there are no required arguments, but all key parameters can becontrolled via command-line options.```bashpython3 ./test_open_control.py```### API OverviewPlease see the api documentation [here](https://flexsea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html).## ContributingIf you find a bug or have a feature request, please fork the repository, make yourchanges, and then issue a pull request (PR). We'd love to hear from you!</longdescription>
