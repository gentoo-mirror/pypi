	<longdescription># The pokemon showdown Python environment[![PyPI version fury.io](https://badge.fury.io/py/poke-env.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/poke-env/)[![PyPI pyversions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/poke-env.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/poke-env/)[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/poke-env/badge/?version=stable)](https://poke-env.readthedocs.io/en/stable/?badge=stable)A Python interface to create battling pokemon agents. `poke-env` offers an easy-to-use interface for creating rule-based or training Reinforcement Learning bots to battle on [pokemon showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/).![A simple agent in action](rl-gif.gif)# Getting startedAgents are instance of python classes inheriting from `Player`. Here is what your first agent could look like:```pythonclass YourFirstAgent(Player):    def choose_move(self, battle):        for move in battle.available_moves:            if move.base_power &gt; 90:                # A powerful move! Let's use it                return self.create_order(move)        # No available move? Let's switch then!        for switch in battle.available_switches:            if switch.current_hp_fraction &gt; battle.active_pokemon.current_hp_fraction:                # This other pokemon has more HP left... Let's switch it in?                return self.create_order(switch)        # Not sure what to do?        return self.choose_random_move(battle)```To get started, take a look at [our documentation](https://poke-env.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)!## Documentation and examplesDocumentation, detailed examples and starting code can be found [on readthedocs](https://poke-env.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).## InstallationThis project requires python &gt;= 3.7 and a [Pokemon Showdown](https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown) server.```pip install poke-env```You can use [smogon's server](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/) to try out your agents against humans, but having a development server is strongly recommended. In particular, it is recommended to use the `--no-security` flag to run a local server with most rate limiting and throttling turned off. Please refer to [the docs](https://poke-env.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html#configuring-a-showdown-server) for detailed setup instructions.```git clone https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown.gitcd pokemon-showdownnpm installcp config/config-example.js config/config.jsnode pokemon-showdown start --no-security```### Development versionYou can also clone the latest master version with:```git clone https://github.com/hsahovic/poke-env.git```Dependencies and development dependencies can then be installed with:```pip install -r requirements.txtpip install -r requirements-dev.txt```## AcknowledgementsThis project is a follow-up of a group project from an artifical intelligence class at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/).You can find the original repository [here](https://github.com/hsahovic/inf581-project). It is partially inspired by the [showdown-battle-bot project](https://github.com/Synedh/showdown-battle-bot). Of course, none of these would have been possible without [Pokemon Showdown](https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown).Team data comes from [Smogon forums' RMT section](https://www.smogon.com/).## DataData files are adapted version of the `js` data files of [Pokemon Showdown](https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown).## License[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)## Other[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/hsahovic/poke-env.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/hsahovic/poke-env)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/hsahovic/poke-env/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/hsahovic/poke-env)&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ambv/black&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Code style: black&quot; src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</longdescription>
