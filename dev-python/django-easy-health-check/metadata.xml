	<longdescription># Django-easy-health-checkDjango-easy-health-check is a Django package that provides an easy-to-use middleware to allow health check.## MotivationDjango's ALLOWED_HOSTS setting often would prevent health check from being completed successfully in production. Acommon method of getting around this involves making a request to fetch ip address about the instance itself and addingit to the ALLOWED_HOSTS. This approach often varies depending on deployment platform/environment.This package provides a simple middleware that allows requests to a specified health check path to be made withoutchecking against ALLOWED_HOSTS setting. This negates the need to modify ALLOWED_HOSTS setting in runtime, and istherefore platform-agnostic.## Quick startInstall using pip:```pip install django-easy-health-check```Or, install from source:```commandlinepip install git+https://github.com/oscarychen/django-easy-health-check.git```Add the health check middleware to Django settings before `django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware`:```pythonMIDDLEWARE = [    ...,    'easy_health_check.middleware.HealthCheckMiddleware',    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',    ...]```By default, the health check url will be available at &quot;example.com/healthcheck/&quot;.## SettingsYou can customize and overwrite the default settings by including the following in your project's settings.py:```pythonDJANGO_EASY_HEALTH_CHECK = {    &quot;PATH&quot;: &quot;/healthcheck/&quot;,    &quot;RETURN_STATUS_CODE&quot;: 200,    &quot;RETURN_BYTE_DATA&quot;: &quot;&quot;,    &quot;RETURN_HEADERS&quot;: None}```In production, you may also want to set the following Django settings:```pythonALLOWED_HOSTS = [&quot;example.com&quot;]SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = TrueSECURE_REDIRECT_EXEMPT = [r'^healthcheck/$']```</longdescription>
