	<longdescription># IntroductionThis package contains the scoring functions for REINVENT.# InstallationTo install in REINVENT's environment either install from repo or use `pip install reinvent-scoring` for the latestofficial release.# Developing## Setup environmentYou can use Conda to create an environment with all the necessary packages installed.```$ conda env create -f reinvent_scoring[...]$ conda activate reinvent_scoring```## Run testsThe tests use the `unittest` package testing framework.  Before you can run the tests make sure that you have created a`config.json`file in the `reinvent_scoring/configs` directory.  There is an example config in the same directory, which you can base your own config off of.  Make sure that you set `MAIN_TEST_PATH` to a non-existent directory; it is where temporary files will be written during the tests; if it is set to an existing directory, that directory will be removed once the tests have finished.Some tests require a proprietary OpenEye license; you have to set up a few things to make the tests read yourlicense.  The simple way is to just set the `OE_LICENSE` environment variable to the path of the file containing thelicense.  If you just want to set the license in the `reinvent_scoring` Conda environment, it is a bit more complicated,but you only have to do it once.```(reinvent-scoring) $ cd $CONDA_PREFIX$ mkdir -p etc/conda/activate.d$ mkdir -p etc/conda/deactivate.d```Put the following in `etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh`.```#!/bin/shexport OE_LICENSE='&lt;/path/to/your/oe_license/file&gt;'```And put the following in `etc/conda/deactivate.d/env_vars.sh`.```#!/bin/shunset OE_LICENSE```Once you have created the files, deactivate and re-activate the environment, and `echo $OE_LICENSE` should output thepath to the license file.Once you have created a config file and configured your environment, you can run the tests, located in the `unittest_reinvent` directory, by running```$ python main_test.py```# Building- Building: `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`- Upload build to test: `python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`- Upload build: `python -m twine upload dist/*`</longdescription>
