	<longdescription># Utilitys## General Python UtilitiesA collection of PyQt gui builders and other functions I've found helpful as I develop python mockups.## Installation`utilitys` lives in pypi too, so the easiest way to install it is through `pip`:```bashpip install utilitys```Note that a version of Qt must be installed for it to work, such as PyQt5/6 or Pyside2/6.PyQt5 will also be installed with `pip install utilitys[full]`Alternatively, you can do so through downloading the repository:```bashgit clone https://gitlab.com/ntjess/utilityspip install -e ./utilitys # Or ./utilitys[full] as mentioned above```## UsageUsage will vary depending on the requested capabilities. Check out the `examples` folder for some usages</longdescription>
