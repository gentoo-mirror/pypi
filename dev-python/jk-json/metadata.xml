	<longdescription>jk_json=======Introduction------------This python module provides parser and validator for JSON files and data structures.The JSON parser is designed as a drop-in replacement for the built in python JSON parser as this parser here supports using comments in JSON files (which in some use cases is very a very handy feature).Information about this module can be found here:* [github.org](https://github.com/jkpubsrc/python-module-jk-json)* [pypi.python.org](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jk_json)Why a replacement?------------------For two reasons:1. The existing JSON library does report errors in the data format very well.2. The existing JSON library can't cope with comments. Unfortunately comments in JSON files are a very nice thing.How to use this module----------------------(TODO)Author(s)-------------------* JÃ¼rgen Knauth: pubsrc@binary-overflow.deLicense-------This software is provided under the following license:* Apache Software License 2.0</longdescription>
