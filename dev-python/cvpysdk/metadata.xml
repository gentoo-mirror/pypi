	<longdescription>CVPySDK=======CVPySDK is a Python Package for Commvault Software.CVPySDK uses REST APIs to perform CommCell operations.Requirements------------- Python 3 and above- `requests &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/&gt;`_ Python package- `future &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future&gt;`_ Python package- `xmltodict &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xmltodict&gt;`_ Python package- Commvault Software v11 SP7 or later release with WebConsole installedInstalling CVPySDK------------------CVPySDK can be installed directly from PyPI using pip:    &gt;&gt;&gt; pip install cvpysdkCVPySDK is available on GitHub `here &lt;https://github.com/Commvault/cvpysdk&gt;`__It can also be installed from source.After downloading, from within the ``cvpysdk`` directory, execute:    &gt;&gt;&gt; python setup.py installUsing CVPySDK-------------Login to Commcell:    &gt;&gt;&gt; from cvpysdk.commcell import Commcell    &gt;&gt;&gt; commcell = Commcell(webconsole_hostname, commcell_username, commcell_password)Print all clients:    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(commcell.clients)Get a client:&gt;&gt;&gt; client = commcell.clients.get(client_name)Get an agent:&gt;&gt;&gt; agent = client.agents.get(agent_name)Get an instance:&gt;&gt;&gt; instance = agent.instances.get(instance_name)Browsing content at instance level:&gt;&gt;&gt; paths, dictionary = instance.browse(path='c:\\', show_deleted=True)Browsing content of a instance in a specific time range:&gt;&gt;&gt; paths, dictionary = instance.browse(path='f:\\', from_time='2010-04-19 02:30:00', to_time='2014-12-20 12:00:00')Searching a file in instance backup content:&gt;&gt;&gt; paths, dictionary = instance.find(file_name=&quot;*.csv&quot;)Get a backupset:&gt;&gt;&gt; backupset = instance.backupsets.get(backupset_name)Run backup for a backupset:&gt;&gt;&gt; job = backupset.backup()Browsing content at backupset level:&gt;&gt;&gt; paths, dictionary = backupset.browse(path='c:\\', show_deleted=True)Browsing content of a backupset in a specific time range:&gt;&gt;&gt; paths, dictionary = backupset.browse(path='f:\\', from_time='2010-04-19 02:30:00', to_time='2014-12-20 12:00:00')Searching a file in backupset backup content:&gt;&gt;&gt; paths, dictionary = backupset.find(file_name=&quot;*.csv&quot;)Get a subclient:&gt;&gt;&gt; subclient = backupset.subclients.get(subclient_name)Run backup for a subclient:&gt;&gt;&gt; job = subclient.backup(backup_level, incremental_backup, incremental_level)Browsing content at subclient level:&gt;&gt;&gt; paths, dictionary = subclient.browse(path='c:\\', show_deleted=True)Browsing content of a subclient in a specific time range:&gt;&gt;&gt; paths, dictionary = subclient.browse(path='f:\\', from_time='2010-04-19 02:30:00', to_time='2014-12-20 12:00:00')Searching a file in subclient backup content:&gt;&gt;&gt; paths, dictionary = subclient.find(file_name=&quot;*.txt&quot;)Run restore in place job for a subclient:&gt;&gt;&gt; job = subclient.restore_in_place(paths, overwrite, restore_data_and_acl)Run restore out of place job for a subclient:&gt;&gt;&gt; job = subclient.restore_out_of_place(client, destination_path, paths, overwrite, restore_data_and_acl)Job Operations:&gt;&gt;&gt; job.pause()    # Suspends the Job&gt;&gt;&gt; job.resume()    # Resumes the Job&gt;&gt;&gt; job.kill()    # Kills the Job&gt;&gt;&gt; job.status    # Current Status the Job  --  Completed / Pending / Failed / .... / etc.&gt;&gt;&gt; job.is_finished    # Job finished or not     --  True / False&gt;&gt;&gt; job.delay_reason    # Job delay reason (if any)&gt;&gt;&gt; job.pending_reason    # Job pending reason (if any)Uninstalling------------On Windows, if CVPySDK was installed using an ``.exe`` or ``.msi``installer, simply use the uninstall feature of &quot;**Add/Remove Programs**&quot; in theControl Panel.Alternatively, you can uninstall using the **pip** command:    &gt;&gt;&gt; pip uninstall cvpysdkSubclient Support-----------------Subclient operations are currently supported for the following Agents:#. File System#. Virtual Server#. Cloud Apps#. SQL Server#. NAS / NDMP#. SAP HANA#. ORACLE#. Sybase#. SAP ORACLE#. Exchange Database#. Exchange Mailbox#. Informix#. Notes Database#. MySQL#. PostgreS#. Big Data AppsDocumentation-------------To get started, please see the `full documentation for this library &lt;https://commvault.github.io/cvpysdk/cvpysdk/index.html&gt;`_Contribution Guidelines-----------------------#. We welcome all the enhancements from everyone although we request the developer to follow some guidelines while interacting with the ``CVPySDK`` codebase.#. Before adding any enhancements/bug-fixes, we request you to open an Issue first.#. The SDK team will go over the Issue and notify if it is required or already been worked on.#. If the Issue is approved, the contributor can then make the changes to their fork and open a pull request.Pull Requests*************- CVPySDK has 2 active branches, namely:    - **master**    - **dev**- The contributor should *Fork* the **dev** branch, and make their changes on top of it, and open a *Pull Request*- The **master** branch will then be updated with the **dev** branch, once everything is verified **Note:** The SDK team will not accept any *Pull Requests* on the **master** branchCoding Considerations*********************- All python code should be **PEP8** compliant.- All changes should be consistent with the design of the SDK.- The code should be formatted using **autopep8** with line-length set to **99** instead of default **79**.- All changes and any new methods/classes should be properly documented.- The doc strings should be of the same format as existing docs.Questions/Comments/Suggestions------------------------------If you have any questions or comments, please contact us `here &lt;https://ma.commvault.com/&gt;`__.Also Check out our community for `Automation &lt;https://community.commvault.com/developer-tools-integration-and-automation-workflow-rest-powershell-etc-50&gt;`_ incase of queries.Code of Conduct***************Everyone interacting in the **CVPySDK** project's codebases, issue trackers,chat rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the`PyPA Code of Conduct`_... _PyPA Code of Conduct: https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct/License-------**CVPySDK** and its contents are licensed under `Commvault License &lt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Commvault/cvpysdk/master/LICENSE.txt&gt;`_About Commvault---------------.. image:: https://commvault.github.io/cvpysdk/logo.png    :align: center|`Commvault &lt;https://www.commvault.com/&gt;`_(NASDAQ: CVLT) is a publicly traded data protection and information management software company headquartered in Tinton Falls, New Jersey.It was formed in 1988 as a development group in Bell Labs, and later became a business unit of AT&amp;T Network Systems.
