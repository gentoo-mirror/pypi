Instead of repeating tedious steps to create your Oracle Commerce Cloud’s widget and extension file and folder structures you simply provide with the necessary information needed by your Oracle Commerce Cloud’s backend instance and the module will generate the structure and the basic code you need to start working on your next widget or extension. On top of that, you can also upload it directly to your Oracle Commerce Cloud’s backend instance from the wizard process itself. # Video Tutorial[![Watch the video](https://github.com/valdal14/widgetwizard/blob/master/images/playVideo.png?raw=true)](https://youtu.be/PO--gHMWQac)# ContributingWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.
