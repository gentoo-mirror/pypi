It focuses primarily on facilitating consuming our most popular APIs and services, currently including BIG-IP (via Automation Tool Chain) and F5 Cloud Services.Benefits:- Provides hand-written or auto-generated client code to make F5â€™s APIs/services simple and intuitive to use.- Handles the low-level details of communication with the API or service, including authentication sessions, async task handling, protocol handling, large file uploads, and more.- Can be installed using familiar package management tools such as pip.## Table of Contents- [Usage](#usage)- [User Documentation](#user-documentation)## Usage```python&quot;&quot;&quot; Update BIG-IP L4-L7 configuration using AS3Notes-----Set local environment variables first&quot;&quot;&quot;# export F5_SDK_HOST='192.0.2.10'# export F5_SDK_USERNAME='admin'# export F5_SDK_PWD='admin'# export F5_SDK_AS3_DECL='./my_declaration.json'# export F5_SDK_LOG_LEVEL='DEBUG'import osfrom f5sdk.bigip import ManagementClientfrom f5sdk.bigip.extension import AS3Clientfrom f5sdk.logger import LoggerLOGGER = Logger(__name__).get_logger()def update_as3_config():    &quot;&quot;&quot; Update AS3 configuration    Notes    -----    Includes package installation, service check while    maintaining idempotency    &quot;&quot;&quot;    # create management client    mgmt_client = ManagementClient(        os.environ['F5_SDK_HOST'],        user=os.environ['F5_SDK_USERNAME'],        password=os.environ['F5_SDK_PWD'])    # create extension client    as3_client = AS3Client(mgmt_client)    # Get installed package version info    version_info = as3_client.package.is_installed()    LOGGER.info(version_info['installed'])    LOGGER.info(version_info['installed_version'])    LOGGER.info(version_info['latest_version'])    # install package    if not version_info['installed']:        as3_client.package.install()    # ensure service is available    as3_client.service.is_available()    # configure AS3    return as3_client.service.create(config_file=os.environ['F5_SDK_AS3_DECL'])if __name__ == '__main__':    LOGGER.info(update_as3_config())```## User DocumentationSee the [documentation](https://clouddocs.f5.com/sdk/f5-sdk-python/) for details on installation, usage and much more.## Source RepositorySee the source repository [here](https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-sdk-python).## Filing Issues and Getting HelpIf you come across a bug or other issue when using the SDK, use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-sdk-python/issues) to submit an issue for our team.
