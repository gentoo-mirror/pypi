	<longdescription># PDF and PostScript UtilitiesWeb site: https://github.com/rrthomas/psutils  Maintainer: Reuben Thomas &lt;rrt@sc3d.org&gt;  PSUtils is a suite of utilities for manipulating PDF and PostScriptdocuments. You can select and rearrange pages, including arrangement intosignatures for booklet printing, combine multple pages into a single pagefor n-up printing, and resize, flip and rotate pages.PSUtils is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3, or,at your option, any later version; see the file COPYING. (Some of the inputfiles in the tests directory are not under this license; see the fileCOPYRIGHT in that directory.)If you simply want to use PSUtils, you will find it in most GNU/Linuxdistributions; it is available in brew for macOS and Cygwin for Windows.PostScript files should conform to the PostScript Document StructuringConventions (DSC); however, PSUtils intentionally does not check this, assome programs produce non-conforming output that can be successfullyprocessed anyway. If PSUtils does not work for you, check whether yoursoftware needs to be configured to produce DSC-conformant PostScript.Some old Perl scripts, which mostly fix up the output of various obsoleteprograms and drivers to enable PSUtils to process it, are available in gitin the `old-scripts` directory. They are not supported, and their use isdiscouraged, unless you know you need them!## InstallationThe easiest way to install PSUtils is from PyPI, the Python Package Index:`pip install pspdfutils`(Note the PyPI package name!)## Installation from source or gitPSUtils requires Python 3.9 or later, a handful of Python libraries (listedin `pyproject.toml`, and automatically installed by the build procedure),and libpaper, which allows named paper sizes to be used and configured:libpaper: https://github.com/rrthomas/libpaperIn the source directory: `python -m build` (requires the `build` package tobe installed).Note that to use the scripts before installing them, you need to run themas Python modules; for example:```PYTHONPATH=. python -m psutils.command.psnup -2 foo.ps```## BugsPlease send bug reports, patches and suggestions to the bug tracker ormaintainer (see the top of this file).## AcknowledgementsPSUtils is written and maintained by Reuben Thomas. Version 1 was written byAngus Duggan.psselect in modeled on Chris Torek's dviselect, as is psbook, via AngusDuggan's dvibook; pstops is modeled on Tom Rokicki's dvidvi. psjoin wasoriginally written by Tom Sato.</longdescription>
