	<longdescription>|buildstatus| |Supported Python Versions|An Earley Algorithm Parser toolkit.===========================================This package uses Jay Earley's algorithm for parsing context freegrammars, and comes with some generic Abstract Syntax Treeroutines. There is also a prototype scanner which does its job bycombining Python regular expressions.(SPARK stands for Scanning, Parsing, and Rewriting Kit. It is a poorname since it conflicts with a more popular package of the samename. In the future we will rename this.)The original version of this was written by John Aycock for his Ph.dthesis and was described in his 1998 paper: &quot;Compiling LittleLanguages in Python&quot; at the 7th International Python Conference. Thecurrent incarnation of this code is maintained (or not) by RockyBernstein.Note: Earley algorithm parsers are almost linear when given an LR grammar.These are grammars which are left-recursive.Installation------------This uses `setup.py`, so it follows the standard Python routine:::    python setup.py install # may need sudo    # or if you have pyenv:    python setup.py developExample-------The github `example` directory_ has a worked-out examples; Package uncompyle6_uses this and contains a much larger example.See Also--------* features_* http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~aycock/spark/ (Old and not very well maintained)* https://pypi.python.org/pypi/uncompyle6/.. _features: https://github.com/rocky/python-spark/blob/master/NEW-FEATURES.rst.. _directory: https://github.com/rocky/python-spark/tree/master/example.. _uncompyle6: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/uncompyle6/.. |downloads| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dd/spark.svg.. |buildstatus| image:: https://travis-ci.org/rocky/python-spark.svg :target: https://travis-ci.org/rocky/python-spark.. |Supported Python Versions| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/spark_parser.svg</longdescription>
