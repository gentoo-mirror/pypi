Violating either constraint (e.g. using a high-res image or annotating ~1000 components) incur detrimental performance impacts. S3A is designed to combat both these deficiencies. With images up to 150 MB and 2000 components, the tool remains interactive.___A more detailed overview can be found in the project wiki [here](https://gitlab.com/ficsresearch/s3a/-/wikis/docs/user's-guide).___## InstallationThe easiest method for installing `s3a` is via `pip` after cloning the repository, or directly from pypi:```bashgit clone https://gitlab.com/ficsresearch/s3apip install -e ./s3a# Or from pypi using &quot;pip install s3a&quot;```Note that a version of OpenCV and Qt binding are required for S3A to work. These can be installed for you with the &quot;full&quot; option:```bashpip install -e ./s3a[full]# Or &quot;pip install s3a[full]&quot;```## Running the AppRunning the app is as easy as calling `s3a` as a module or using a provided entry point:```bashpython -m s3a```Or, equivalently:```bashs3a-gui```From here, projects can be created to host groups of related images, or images can be annotated in the default project. Both options are available through the `File` menu.## Detailed Feature ListMore information about the capabilities of this tool are outlined in the [project wiki](https://gitlab.com/ficsresearch/s3a/-/wikis/home).## &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Please Note&lt;/span&gt;S3A's programmatic API is still largely under development. It still needs refinement to allow for consistent naming schemes, removing vestigial elements, confirming private vs. public-facing elements, and a few other line items. However, the graphical interface should be minimally affected by these alterations.Thus, while the GUI entry point should be consistently useful, be aware of these developments when using the scripting portion of S3A in great detail.## LicenseThis tool is free for personal and commercial use (except the limits imposed by the selected Qt binding).
