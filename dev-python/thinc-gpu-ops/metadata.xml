	<longdescription>Thinc GPU Ops*************This library provides additionally CUDA kernels used for `Thinc &lt;https://github.com/explosion/thinc&gt;`_. The kernels need to be compiled, which means they can't be provided in a binary wheel. Since we'd like to provide binary wheels of the rest of Thinc, we split these out into their own package.</longdescription>
