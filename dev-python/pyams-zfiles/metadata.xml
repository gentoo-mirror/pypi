	<longdescription>====================PyAMS ZFiles package====================.. contents::What is PyAMS?==============PyAMS (Pyramid Application Management Suite) is a small suite of packages written for applicationsand content management with the Pyramid framework.**PyAMS** is actually mainly used to manage web sites through content management applications (CMS,see PyAMS_content package), but many features are generic and can be used inside any kind of webapplication.All PyAMS documentation is available on `ReadTheDocs &lt;https://pyams.readthedocs.io&gt;`_; source codeis available on `Gitlab &lt;https://gitlab.com/pyams&gt;`_ and pushed to `Github&lt;https://github.com/py-ams&gt;`_. Doctests are available in the *doctests* source folder.What is ZFiles?===============ZFiles is an extension package for PyAMS which allows to define a &quot;files storage&quot; environment.This environment is very simple, and provides several APIs (for REST/JSON, XML-RPCor JSON-RPC protocols) which allows applications to store and retrieve external files of anytype (maybe images, videos, PDF files...). Applications which are using the service just get aunique ID (called OID) when they upload a new document, which can be stored by the applicationsand used to retrieve them afterwards when needed.ZFiles is just a storage manager for these documents; the lifecycle management is delegated tothe applications which use it as storage backend.Changelog=========2.0.0----- - upgraded to Pyramid 2.0 - updated tests for unauthenticated requests1.4.6----- - updated REST document search API schema1.4.5----- - updated access and update modes management1.4.4----- - updated Colander API schemas for better OpenAPI specifications - added enums for workflow states1.4.3----- - updated translations1.4.2----- - updated workflow delete view1.4.1----- - updated generation evolve1.4.0----- - added multiple synchronizer configurations - added synchronizer access to REST API1.3.4----- - updated synchronizer call result to return enums values instead of enums, which can't be   converted to JSON1.3.3----- - removed permission check for CORS OPTIONS request on document data1.3.2----- - added new PyAMS_security CORS validators to REST services1.3.1----- - updated CORS support in REST API - added support for Python 3.101.3.0----- - added support for CORS preflight OPTIONS verb used by REST services - updated support for search params in URL - updated Gitlab-CI configuration - small ZMI updates1.2.1----- - added enumeration to handle synchronizer status - PyAMS_security interfaces refactoring1.2.0----- - added workflow label - added &quot;NOT_FOUND&quot; status to documents synchronizer if given OID doesn't match an existing   document - added &quot;NO_DATA&quot; status to documents synchronizer if a POSError occurs when reading   document data1.1.0----- - add index on properties to make them searchable1.0.6----- - updated document properties widget template1.0.5----- - added option to display menu to access documents container from ZMI home page1.0.4----- - added missing &quot;context&quot; argument to permission check1.0.3----- - added title to applications vocabulary terms1.0.2----- - updated application manager permissions1.0.1----- - updated context of permissions checks in REST and GraphQL APIs1.0.0----- - initial release</longdescription>
