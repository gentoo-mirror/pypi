	<longdescription>Keras is a deep learning API written in Python,running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow.It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation andproviding a delightful developer experience.The purpose of Keras is to give an *unfair advantage* to any developerlooking to ship ML-powered apps.Keras is:-   **Simple** -- but not simplistic. Keras reduces developer *cognitive load*    to free you to focus on the parts of the problem that really matter.    Keras focuses on ease of use, debugging speed, code elegance &amp; conciseness,    maintainability, and deployability (via TFServing, TFLite, TF.js).-   **Flexible** -- Keras adopts the principle of *progressive disclosure of    complexity*: simple workflows should be quick and easy, while arbitrarily    advanced workflows should be *possible* via a clear path that builds upon    what you've already learned.-   **Powerful** -- Keras provides industry-strength performance and    scalability: it is used by organizations and companies including NASA,    YouTube, and Waymo. That's right -- your YouTube recommendations are    powered by Keras, and so is the world's most advanced driverless vehicle.</longdescription>
