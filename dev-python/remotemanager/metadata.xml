These runs are then executed on the remote machine described by the provided `URL`### InstallationA quick install of the latest stable release can be done via `pip install remotemanager`Alternatively, clone this repo and do a local install via `cd remotemanager &amp;&amp; pip install .`### DocumentationSee the [documentation](https://l_sim.gitlab.io/remotemanager/) for further information, tutorials and api documentation.</longdescription>
