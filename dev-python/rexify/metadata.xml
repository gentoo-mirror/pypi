Rexify also includesmodules to deal with feature engineering as Scikit-Learn Transformers and Pipelines.With Rexify, users may easily train Recommender Systems models, just by specifying what theirdata looks like. Rexify also comes equipped with pre-built machine learning pipelines which canbe used serverlessly. ## What is Rexify?Rexify is a low-code personalization tool, that makes use of traditional machine learning frameworks, such as Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow, to create scalable Recommender Systemsworkflows that anyone can use.### Who is it for?Rexify is a project that simplifies and standardizes the workflow of recommender systems. It is mostly geared towards people with little to no machine learning knowledge, that want to implementsomewhat scalable Recommender Systems in their applications.## InstallationThe easiest way to install Rexify is via `pip`:```shellpip install rexify```## Quick TourRexify is meant to be usable right out of the box. All you need to set up your model is interactiondata - something that kind of looks like this:| user_id | item_id | timestamp  | event_type  ||---------|---------|------------|-------------|| 22      | 67      | 2021/05/13 | Purchase    || 37      | 9       | 2021/04/11 | Page View   || 22      | 473     | 2021/04/11 | Add to Cart || ...     | ...     | ...        | ...         || 358     | 51      | 2021/04/11 | Purchase    |Additionally, we'll have to have configured a schema for the data.This schema is what will allow Rexify to generate a dynamic model and preprocessing steps.The schema should be comprised of two dictionaries (`user`, `Ã¬tem`) and two key-value pairs: `event_type` (which should point to the column of the event type) and `timestamp` (which should point to the timestamp column)Each of these dictionaries should consist of features and internal data types, such as: `id`, `category`, `number`. More data types will be available in the future.```json{  &quot;user&quot;: {    &quot;user_id&quot;: &quot;id&quot;,    &quot;age&quot;: &quot;number&quot;  },  &quot;item&quot;: {    &quot;item_id&quot;: &quot;id&quot;,    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;category&quot;  },  &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;timestamp&quot;  &quot;event_type&quot;: &quot;event_type&quot;}```Essentially, what Rexify will do is take the schema, and dynamically adapt to the data.There are two main components in Rexify workflows: `FeatureExtractor` and `Recommender`.The `FeatureExtractor` is a scikit-learn Transformer that basically takes the schema of the data, and transforms the event data accordingly. Another method `.make_dataset()`, converts the transformed data into a `tf.data.Dataset`, all correctly configured to be fedto the `Recommender` model.`Recommender` is a `tfrs.Model` that basically implements the Query and Candidate towers. During training, the Query tower will take the user ID, user features, and context, to learn an embedding; the Candidate tower will do the same for the item ID and its features. More information about how the `FeatureExtractor` and the `Recommender` works can be found [here](https://rexify.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/architecture.html). A sample Rexify workflow should sort of look like this:````pythonimport pandas as pdfrom rexify import Schema, FeatureExtractor, Recommenderevents = pd.read_csv('path/to/events/data')schema = Schema.load('path/to/schema')feat = FeatureExtractor(schema, users='path/to/users/data', items='path/to/events/data')x = feat.fit_transform(events)x = feat.make_dataset(x)model = Recommender(**feat.model_params)model.compile()model.fit(events, batch_size=512)````When training is complete, you'll have a trained `tf.keras.Model` ready to be used, asyou normally would. ## License[MIT](https://github.com/joseprsm/rexify/blob/main/LICENSE)</longdescription>
