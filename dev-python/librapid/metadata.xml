All calculations are vectorised with SIMD instructions and are run on multiple threads (ifnecessary) to make them as fast as possible on any given machine.There are also a wide range of helper functions and classes to aid the development of your own project.LibRapid is highly templated, meaning it can conform to exactly your needs with minimal compile-times and even supportfor custom datatypes.# Current Development StageAt the current point in time, LibRapid C++ is under rapid development byme ([pencilcaseman](https://github.com/Pencilcaseman)).I am currently doing my A-Levels and do not have time to work on the library as much as I would like, so if you orsomeone you know might be willing to support the development of the library, feel free to create a pull request or chatto us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cGxTFTgCAC). Any help is greatly appreciated!# Future PlansMy goal for LibRapid is to develop the C++ interface further, at least initially. At some point I want to add Python andJavascript interfaces (in that order) to increase the range of people who can benefit from the library, but the mostimportant thing is the performance of the underlying C++ code.# External DependenciesLibRapid has a few external dependencies to improve functionality and performance. Some of these are optional, and canbe included with a CMake option. The following is a list of the external dependencies and their purpose:- Required    - [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) - Advanced string formatting    - [scnlib](https://github.com/eliaskosunen/scnlib) - Advanced string parsing    - [thread-pool](https://github.com/bshoshany/thread-pool) - Thread pool for parallel execution- Optional    - [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) - Multi-threading library    - [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) - GPU computing library    - [mpfr](https://github.com/Pencilcaseman/mpfr) - Arbitrary precision numbers (integer, real, rational)    - [Vc](https://github.com/VcDevel/Vc) - SIMD library# Star History[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=librapid/librapid&amp;type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#librapid/librapid&amp;Date)# SupportThanks to JetBrains for providing LibRapid with free licenses for their amazing tools!&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com&quot;&gt;    &lt;img src=&quot;https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/jetbrains-variant-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;JetBrains&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</longdescription>
