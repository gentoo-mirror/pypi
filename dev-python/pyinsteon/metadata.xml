	<longdescription>This is a Python package to interface with an Insteon Modem. It has beentested to work with most USB or RS-232 serial based devices such as the`2413U &lt;https://www.insteon.com/powerlinc-modem-usb&gt;`__,`2412S &lt;https://www.insteon.com/powerlinc-modem-serial&gt;`__,`2448A7 &lt;http://www.insteon.com/usb-wireless-adapter&gt;`__ and Hub models`2242 &lt;https://www.insteon.com/support-knowledgebase/2014/9/26/insteon-hub-owners-manual&gt;`__and `2245 &lt;https://www.insteon.com/insteon-hub/&gt;`__. Other models havenot been tested but the underlying protocol has not changed much overtime so it would not be surprising if it worked with a number of othermodels.
