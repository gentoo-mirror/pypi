	<longdescription># django_orm_viewsThe package for managing database views using django, without the migrations.It can be used for generating database views and reading from them using django orm system.## What does this support?* This package adds support to Django for **writing** Postgres views using:  * Raw SQL  * Django QuerysetsThey look something like this:```pythonclass MySQLView(PostgresViewFromSQL):    sql = &quot;&quot;&quot;       SELECT col_a, col_b FROM table_1;    &quot;&quot;&quot;``````pythonclass MyQuerysetView(PostgresViewFromQueryset):    @classmethod    def get_queryset(cls):        return (            Table1            .objects            .values('col_a', 'col_b')        )```* The package allows reading from a view using django ORM. For a view to be readable, it has to be inherited from  one of the readable view abstractions - `ReadableViewFromQueryset` or `ReadableViewFromSQL`. It would look like this:```pythonclass MyReadableView(ReadableViewFromQueryset):    @classmethod    def get_queryset(cls):        return (            Table1            .objects            .values('col_a', 'col_b')        )    result = MyReadableView.objects.all()result = MyReadableView.objects.filter(name=&quot;test&quot;)result = MyReadableView.objects.get(id=1)```The **name** for the view in the database is generated automatically in the base class - `BasePostgresView`.It's not possible at the moment to define a custom name in the database for a readable view. Though it's possible if theview is not readable (not inherited from the readable view abstraction).Since a readable view is basically a not managed django model, you might want toset some custom meta data for it by defining a Meta class inside the readable view (For example changing the data source - `db_table`).**! Note** that defining a custom Meta class is not allowed in the current version of the package and will lead to an error!See some more examples in the tests [here](https://github.com/iwoca/django-orm-views/blob/main/tests/test_project/test_app/postgres_views.py)This also supports the construction of materialised views via `PostgresMaterialisedViewMixin`. Note that the function `refresh_materialized_view` willneed to be managed by the user in order to keep these up to date where required.   ## What does this not support?* Any database engines aside from Postgres (unless syntax happens to be the same!)* Defining custom name for a readable view in the database. Although it's possible for a view that is not readable.* Defining custom Meta class in a readable view as it can be done for a django modelto define additional settings E.g. `db_table`## When should I use this?Our use-case is for a database which is managed by Djangoin which we would like to provide an analytics-friendlyrepresentation of some of our data.  This involves givinganalytics direct access to our database (whilst using apermissions framework), but using views to expose the datain a more simple way, as well as obscuring data whichwe consider personally identifiable/sensitive.There are other frameworks existing which do similar things,usually including reads via the ORM.  We found that thesepackages all generate migrations (despite being unmanaged)and we wanted to remove this from the django migrations processaltogether - there seemed to be no value add by includingmigrations and they would just muddy our migration states.## Cool! But how do I use this?* `pip install django-orm-views`* Add `'django_orm_views'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`* Create a `postgres_views.py` (file or package) inside any app* Add a `PostgresViewFromQueryset` or `PostgresViewFromSQL` to your `postgres_views.py` (as above)* run `./manage.py sync_views`A `postgres_views.py` file might look something like the following:```pythonclass ComplexViewFromQueryset(PostgresViewFromQueryset):    prefix = 'test'  # This is optional, but allows you to prefix the table names for views        @classmethod    def get_queryset(cls):  # Return a `.values` with the query you desire        return (            TestModelWithForeignKey            .objects            .all()            .annotate(                double_integer_col=F('foreign_key__integer_col') * 2            )            .values(                'id',                'foreign_key__id',                'foreign_key__integer_col',                'foreign_key__character_col',                'foreign_key__date_col',                'foreign_key__datetime_col',                'double_integer_col',            )        )```When we run the `./manage.py sync_views`, we'll create a view called `test_complexviewfromqueryset` underthe `views` schema.Note, you can put `./manage.py sync_views` into your CI/CD.  It works by:* Opening a transaction* Dropping the views schema* Recreating the views schema* Recreating all views under that schema* Committing the transaction## What's still to come?* Support for more database engines.  This currently only supports Postgres, but should be a reasonably light shift to support other database engines.* Making the package more configurable using settings.* Consideration of 0 downtime deployments with views.  * Note, this can still be achieved with the current implementation,  but a bad migration (with a view depending) could  cascade a view and create downtime.  Ideally migrations +   view creation should happen in a single transaction.## ContributingFeel free to fork the package and propose changes.  The repo comes with a test django project whichcan be used to effectively test changes.  It also demonstrates the functionality pretty well.</longdescription>
