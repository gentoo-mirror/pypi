But, it's a bit annoyingto have to change the filename to change the names in the sidebar or reorder the pagesin your app. Even more, I really dislike having to put emojis in filenames.This is an experimental package to try out how page-management might work ifyou could name the pages whatever you wanted, and could manage which pages are visible,and how they appear in the sidebar, via a setup function.This enables you to set page _name_, _icon_ and _order_ independently of file name/path,while still retaining the same sidebar &amp; url behavior of current streamlit multi-pageapps.## How to use### Method one: declare pages inside your streamlit code```pythonfrom st_pages import Page, show_pages, add_page_title# Optional -- adds the title and icon to the current pageadd_page_title()# Specify what pages should be shown in the sidebar, and what their titles and icons# should beshow_pages(    [        Page(&quot;streamlit_app.py&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;üè†&quot;),        Page(&quot;other_pages/page2.py&quot;, &quot;Page 2&quot;, &quot;:books:&quot;),    ])```If you want to organize your pages into sections with indention showing which pagesbelong to which section, you can do the following:```pythonfrom st_pages import Page, Section, show_pages, add_page_titleadd_page_title() # By default this also adds indentation# Specify what pages should be shown in the sidebar, and what their titles and icons# should beshow_pages(    [        Page(&quot;streamlit_app.py&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;üè†&quot;),        Page(&quot;other_pages/page2.py&quot;, &quot;Page 2&quot;, &quot;:books:&quot;),        Section(&quot;My section&quot;, icon=&quot;üéàÔ∏è&quot;),        # Pages after a section will be indented        Page(&quot;Another page&quot;, icon=&quot;üí™&quot;),        # Unless you explicitly say in_section=False        Page(&quot;Not in a section&quot;, in_section=False)    ])```### Method two: declare pages inside of a config fileContents of `.streamlit/pages.toml````toml[[pages]]path = &quot;streamlit_app.py&quot;name = &quot;Home&quot;icon = &quot;üè†&quot;[[pages]]path = &quot;other_pages/page2.py&quot;name = &quot;Page 2&quot;icon = &quot;:books:&quot;```Example with sections:```toml[[pages]]path = &quot;streamlit_app.py&quot;name = &quot;Home&quot;icon = &quot;üè†&quot;[[pages]]path = &quot;other_pages/page2.py&quot;name = &quot;Page 2&quot;icon = &quot;:books:&quot;[[pages]]name = &quot;My second&quot;icon = &quot;üéàÔ∏è&quot;is_section = true# Pages after an `is_section = true` will be indented[[pages]]name = &quot;Another page&quot;icon = &quot;üí™&quot;# Unless you explicitly say in_section = false`[[pages]]name = &quot;Not in a section&quot;in_section = false```Streamlit code:```pythonfrom st_pages import show_pages_from_config, add_page_title# Either this or add_indentation() MUST be called on each page in your# app to add indendation in the sidebaradd_page_title()show_pages_from_config()```# Hiding pagesYou can now pass a list of page names to `hide_pages` to hide pages dynamically for eachuser. Note that these pages are only hidden via CSS, and can still be visited by the URL.However, this could be a good option if you simply want a way to visually direct youruser where they should be able to go next.</longdescription>
