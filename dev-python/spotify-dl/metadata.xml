I no longer use this, but continue to maintain this. spotify-dl doesn't download anything from Spotify. It picks up the metadata from Spotify API and then uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to download the song.### How do I get this thing running?Install using pip    pip3 install spotify_dlRun the program    spotify_dl -l spotify_playlist_link_1 spotify_playlist_link_2If you want to make use of parallel download, pass `-mc &lt;number&gt;`, where `&lt;number&gt;` refers to number of cores. If this is too high, spotify-dl will set it to one lesser than max number of cores that you have.    spotify_dl -mc 4 -l spotify_playlist_link_1 spotify_playlist_link_2Spotify-dl can make use of SponsorBlock and skip non-music sections when downloading from YouTube. This is disabled by default and can be enabled using:        spotify_dl -l spotify_playlist_link_1 -s yFor running in verbose mode, append `-V`    spotify_dl -V -l spotify_playlist_link -o download_directoryFor more details and other arguments, issue `-h`    spotify_dl -hSee [the getting started guide](https://github.com/SathyaBhat/spotify-dl/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md) for more details.### Demo[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/488558.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/488558)### Contributing and Local developmentPull requests and any contributions are always welcome.
