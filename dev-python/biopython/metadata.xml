Please see the `LICENSE&lt;https://github.com/biopython/biopython/blob/master/LICENSE.rst&gt;`_ file forfurther details.If you use Biopython in work contributing to a scientific publication, we askthat you cite our application note (below) or one of the module specificpublications (listed on our website):Cock, P.J.A. et al. Biopython: freely available Python tools for computationalmolecular biology and bioinformatics. Bioinformatics 2009 Jun 1; 25(11) 1422-3https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp163 pmid:19304878For the impatient=================Python includes the package management system &quot;pip&quot; which should allow you toinstall Biopython (and its dependency NumPy if needed), upgrade or uninstallwith just one terminal command::    pip install biopython    pip install --upgrade biopython    pip uninstall biopythonSince Biopython 1.70 we have provided pre-compiled binary wheel packages onPyPI for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. This means pip install should be quick,and not require a compiler.As a developer or potential contributor, you may wish to download, build andinstall Biopython yourself. This is described below.Python Requirements===================We currently recommend using Python 3.10 from http://www.python.orgBiopython is currently supported and tested on the following Pythonimplementations:- Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 -- see http://www.python.org- PyPy3.7 v7.3.5 -- or later, see http://www.pypy.orgOptional Dependencies=====================Biopython requires NumPy (see http://www.numpy.org) which will be installedautomatically if you install Biopython with pip (see below for compilingBiopython yourself).Depending on which parts of Biopython you plan to use, there are a number ofother optional Python dependencies, which can be installed later if needed:- ReportLab, see http://www.reportlab.com/opensource/ (optional)  This package is only used in ``Bio.Graphics``, so if you do not need this  functionality, you will not need to install this package.- matplotlib, see http://matplotlib.org/ (optional)  ``Bio.Phylo`` uses this package to plot phylogenetic trees.- networkx, see https://networkx.github.io/ (optional) and  pygraphviz or pydot, see https://pygraphviz.github.io/ and  http://code.google.com/p/pydot/ (optional)  These packages are used for certain niche functions in ``Bio.Phylo``.- rdflib, see https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib (optional)  This package is used in the CDAO parser under ``Bio.Phylo``.- psycopg2, see http://initd.org/psycopg/ (optional) or  PyGreSQL (pgdb), see http://www.pygresql.org/ (optional)  These packages are used by ``BioSQL`` to access a PostgreSQL database.- MySQL Connector/Python, see http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/  This package is used by ``BioSQL`` to access a MySQL database, and is  supported on PyPy too.- mysqlclient, see https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python (optional)  This is a fork of the older MySQLdb and is used by ``BioSQL`` to access a  MySQL database. It is supported by PyPy.In addition there are a number of useful third party tools you may wish toinstall such as standalone NCBI BLAST, EMBOSS or ClustalW.Installation From Source========================We recommend using the pre-compiled binary wheels available on PyPI using::    pip install biopythonHowever, if you need to compile Biopython yourself, the following are requiredat compile time:- Python including development header files like ``python.h``, which on Linux  are often not installed by default (trying looking for and installing a  package named ``python-dev`` or ``python-devel`` as well as the ``python``  package).- Appropriate C compiler for your version of Python, for example GCC on Linux,  MSVC on Windows. For Mac OS X, or as it is now branded, macOS, use Apple's  command line tools, which can be installed with the terminal command::      xcode-select --install  This will offer to install Apple's XCode development suite - you can, but it  is not needed and takes a lot of disk space.Then either download and decompress our source code, or fetch it using git.Now change directory to the Biopython source code folder and run::    pip install -e .    python setup.py test    sudo python setup.py installSubstitute ``python`` with your specific version if required, for example``python3``, or ``pypy3``.To exclude tests that require an internet connection (and which may take along time), use the ``--offline`` option::    python setup.py test --offlineIf you need to do additional configuration, e.g. changing the installdirectory prefix, please type ``python setup.py``.Testing=======Biopython includes a suite of regression tests to check if everything isrunning correctly. To run the tests, go to the biopython source codedirectory and type::    pip install -e .    python setup.py testIf you want to skip the online tests (which is recommended when doing repeatedtesting), use::    python setup.py test --offlineDo not panic if you see messages warning of skipped tests::    test_DocSQL ... skipping. Install MySQLdb if you want to use Bio.DocSQL.This most likely means that a package is not installed.  You canignore this if it occurs in the tests for a module that you were notplanning on using.  If you did want to use that module, please installthe required dependency and re-run the tests.Some of the tests may fail due to network issues, this is often down tochance or a service outage. If the problem does not go away onre-running the tests, you can use the ``--offline`` option.There is more testing information in the Biopython Tutorial &amp; Cookbook.Experimental code=================Biopython 1.61 introduced a new warning, ``Bio.BiopythonExperimentalWarning``,which is used to mark any experimental code included in the otherwisestable Biopython releases. Such 'beta' level code is ready for widertesting, but still likely to change, and should only be tried by earlyadopters in order to give feedback via the biopython-dev mailing list.We'd expect such experimental code to reach stable status within one or tworeleases, at which point our normal policies about trying to preservebackwards compatibility would apply.Bugs====While we try to ship a robust package, bugs inevitably pop up.  If you arehaving problems that might be caused by a bug in Biopython, it is possiblethat it has already been identified. Update to the latest release if you arenot using it already, and retry. If the problem persists, please search ourbug database and our mailing lists to see if it has already been reported(and hopefully fixed), and if not please do report the bug. We can't fixproblems we don't know about ;)Issue tracker: https://github.com/biopython/biopython/issuesIf you suspect the problem lies within a parser, it is likely that the dataformat has changed and broken the parsing code.  (The text BLAST and GenBankformats seem to be particularly fragile.)  Thus, the parsing code inBiopython is sometimes updated faster than we can build Biopython releases.You can get the most recent parser by pulling the relevant files (e.g. theones in ``Bio.SeqIO`` or ``Bio.Blast``) from our git repository. However, becareful when doing this, because the code in github is not as well-testedas released code, and may contain new dependencies.In any bug report, please let us know:1. Which operating system and hardware (32 bit or 64 bit) you are using2. Python version3. Biopython version (or git commit/date)4. Traceback that occurs (the full error message)And also ideally:5. Example code that breaks6. A data file that causes the problemContributing, Bug Reports=========================Biopython is run by volunteers from all over the world, with many types ofbackgrounds.
