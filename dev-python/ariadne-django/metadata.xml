	<longdescription>![Build Status](https://github.com/reset-button/ariadne_django/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)[![Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/reset-button/ariadne_django/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/reset-button/ariadne_django)# Maintainer statusWe're looking for a new maintainer, the folks that previously worked on this are off to new pastures and have very limited availability.# AriadneAriadne is a Python library for implementing [GraphQL](http://graphql.github.io/) servers.- **Schema-first:** Ariadne enables Python developers to use schema-first approach to the API implementation. This is the leading approach used by the GraphQL community and supported by dozens of frontend and backend developer tools, examples, and learning resources. Ariadne makes all of this immediately available to your and other members of your team.- **Simple:** Ariadne offers small, consistent and easy to memorize API that lets developers focus on business problems, not the boilerplate.- **Open:** Ariadne was designed to be modular and open for customization. If you are missing or unhappy with something, extend or easily swap with your own.Documentation is available [here](https://ariadnegraphql.org).# ariadne_djangoariadne_django is designed to make integrating Ariadne with Django simpler.This project splits the existing code from Ariadne's 0.12 release (with enthusiastic permission from Mirumee), decoupling the release of django-specific enhancements for Ariadne from the main ariadne release cycle.This allows us to be responsive to the needs of both Django and Ariadne.## PrinciplesThis project is committed to maintaining Ariadne's schema-first approach.  We may offer tooling that simplifies the mapping of Django models to schema types (or similar), but we won't require its usage.This project does not require Django REST Framework, but will provide features leveraging common DRF tools (e.g. serializers) that provide significant functionality and performance enhancements beyond Django Forms.## Installation### Add to projectInstall via pip:`python -m pip install ariadne_django`### Add to settingsAdd ariadne_django to your project's INSTALLED_APPS setting (usually located in settings.py):```INSTALLED_APPS = [    ...    &quot;ariadne_django&quot;,]```The Ariadne app provides a Django template for GraphQL Playground. Make sure that your Django project is configured to load templates from application directories. This can be done by checking if APP_DIRS option located in TEMPLATES setting is set to True:```TEMPLATES = [    {        ...,        'APP_DIRS': True,        ...    },]```### Create executable schemaCreate a Python module somewhere in your project that will define the executable schema. It may be schema module living right next to your settings and urls:```# schema.pyfrom ariadne import QueryType, make_executable_schematype_defs = &quot;&quot;&quot;    type Query {        hello: String!    }&quot;&quot;&quot;query = QueryType()@query.field(&quot;hello&quot;)def resolve_hello(*_):    return &quot;Hello world!&quot;schema = make_executable_schema(type_defs, query)```### Add your GraphQL ViewAdd a GraphQL view to your project's urls.py:```from ariadne_django.views import GraphQLViewfrom django.urls import pathfrom .schema import schemaurlpatterns = [    ...    path('graphql/', GraphQLView.as_view(schema=schema), name='graphql'),]```GraphQLView.as_view() takes mostly the same options that graphql does, but with some differences:- debug option is not available and it's set to the value of settings.DEBUG- Django GraphQL view supports extra option specific to it: playground_options, a dict of GraphQL Playground options that should be used.### ChannelsAriadne's ASGI application can be used together with Django Channels to implement an asynchronous GraphQL API with features like subscriptions:```from ariadne.asgi import GraphQLfrom channels.http import AsgiHandlerfrom channels.routing import URLRouterfrom django.urls import path, re_pathschema = ...application = URLRouter([    path(&quot;graphql/&quot;, GraphQL(schema, debug=True)),    re_path(r&quot;&quot;, AsgiHandler),])```At the moment, Django ORM doesn't support asynchronous query execution and there is noticeable performance loss when using it for database access in asynchronous resolvers.To get around this, you can use an asynchronous ORM such as Gino for database queries in your resolvers.## Upgrading from ariadne.contrib.djangoInside your project, replace all references to ariadne.contrib.django with ariadne_django.```find {path_to_your_project} -type f -name \*.py -exec sed -i 's/ariadne\.contrib\.django/ariadne_django/g' {} \;```## Local Development1. Clone the project1. Setup virtualenv1. Make changes1. Run tests, etc. locally1. Create PR# AppreciationWith sincere thanks to Mirumee, who crafted the original code of this module and ariadne with &lt;3.</longdescription>
