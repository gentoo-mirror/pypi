Jump straight toone of the sections below, or just scroll down to find out more.- [What are we doing? (And why?)](#what-are-we-doing)- [Installation](#installation)- [Running](#running)- [Supported datasets](#supported-datasets)- [Who are we? n](#who-are-we)- [Get in touch](#contact-us)- [Documentation][link_moabb_docs]- [Architecture and main concepts](#architecture-and-main-concepts)- [Citing MOABB and related publications](#citing-moabb-and-related-publications)## What are we doing?### The problem[Brain-Computer Interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface)allow to interact with a computer using brain signals. In this project, we focus mostly onelectroencephalographic signals([EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography)), that is a very activeresearch domain, with worldwide scientific contributions. Still:- Reproducible Research in BCI has a long way to go.- While many BCI datasets are made freely available, researchers do not publish code, and  reproducing results required to benchmark new algorithms turns out to be trickier than  it should be.- Performances can be significantly impacted by parameters of the preprocessing steps,  toolboxes used and implementation “tricks” that are almost never reported in the  literature.As a result, there is no comprehensive benchmark of BCI algorithms, and newcomers arespending a tremendous amount of time browsing literature to find out what algorithm worksbest and on which dataset.### The solutionThe Mother of all BCI Benchmarks allows to:- Build a comprehensive benchmark of popular BCI algorithms applied on an extensive list  of freely available EEG datasets.- The code will be made available on github, serving as a reference point for the future  algorithmic developments.- Algorithms can be ranked and promoted on a website, providing a clear picture of the  different solutions available in the field.This project will be successful when we read in an abstract “ … the proposed methodobtained a score of 89% on the MOABB (Mother of All BCI Benchmarks), outperforming thestate of the art by 5% ...”.## Installation### Pip installationTo use MOABB, you could simply do: \`pip install MOABB` \See [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) section if you have a problem.### Manual installationYou could fork or clone the repository and go to the downloaded directory, then run:1. install `poetry` (only once per machine):\   `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -`\   or [checkout installation instruction](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) or   use [conda forge version](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/poetry)1. (Optional, skip if not sure) Disable automatic environment creation:\   `poetry config virtualenvs.create false`1. install all dependencies in one command (have to be run in the project directory):\   `poetry install`See [contributors' guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed explanation.### Requirements we useSee `pyproject.toml` file for full list of dependencies## Running### Verify InstallationTo ensure it is running correctly, you can also run```python -m unittest moabb.tests```once it is installed.### Use MOABBFirst, you could take a look at our [tutorials](./tutorials) that cover the most importantconcepts and use cases. Also, we have a several [examples](./examples/) available.You might be interested in [MOABB documentation][link_moabb_docs]### TroubleshootingCurrently pip install moabb fails when pip version &lt; 21, e.g. with 20.0.2 due to an `idna`package conflict. Newer pip versions resolve this conflict automatically. To fix this youcan upgrade your pip version using: `pip install -U pip` before installing `moabb`.## Supported datasetsThe list of supported datasets can be found here :https://neurotechx.github.io/moabb/datasets.html### Submit a new datasetyou can submit a new dataset by mentioning it to this[issue](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb/issues/1). The datasets currently on our radarcan be seen [here] (https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb/wiki/Datasets-Support)## Who are we?The founders of the Mother of all BCI Benchmarks are [Alexander Barachant][link_alex_b]and [Vinay Jayaram][link_vinay]. This project is under the umbrella of[NeuroTechX][link_neurotechx], the international community for NeuroTech enthusiasts. Theproject is currently maintained by [Sylvain Chevallier][link_sylvain].### What do we need?**You**! In whatever way you can help.We need expertise in programming, user experience, software sustainability, documentationand technical writing and project management.We'd love your feedback along the way.Our primary goal is to build a comprehensive benchmark of popular BCI algorithms appliedon an extensive list of freely available EEG datasets, and we're excited to support theprofessional development of any and all of our contributors. If you're looking to learn tocode, try out working collaboratively, or translate your skills to the digital domain,we're here to help.### Get involvedIf you think you can help in any of the areas listed above (and we bet you can) or in anyof the many areas that we haven't yet thought of (and here we're _sure_ you can) thenplease check out our [contributors' guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and our[roadmap](ROADMAP.md).Please note that it's very important to us that we maintain a positive and supportiveenvironment for everyone who wants to participate.

In addition, we offer statistical and visualization utilities to simplify the workflow.### DatasetsA dataset handles and abstracts low-level access to the data. The dataset will read datastored locally, in the format in which they have been downloaded, and will convert theminto a MNE raw object. There are options to pool all the different recording sessions persubject or to evaluate them separately.### ParadigmA paradigm defines how the raw data will be converted to trials ready to be processed by adecoding algorithm. This is a function of the paradigm used, i.e. in motor imagery one canhave two-class, multi-class, or continuous paradigms; similarly, different preprocessingis necessary for ERP vs ERD paradigms.### EvaluationsAn evaluation defines how we go from trials per subject and session to a generalizationstatistic (AUC score, f-score, accuracy, etc) -- it can be either within-recording-sessionaccuracy, across-session within-subject accuracy, across-subject accuracy, or othertransfer learning settings.### PipelinesPipeline defines all steps required by an algorithm to obtain predictions. Pipelines aretypically a chain of sklearn compatible transformers and end with a sklearn compatibleestimator. See[Pipelines](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html)for more info.### Statistics and visualizationOnce an evaluation has been run, the raw results are returned as a DataFrame. This can befurther processed via the following commands to generate some basic visualization andstatistical comparisons:```from moabb.analysis import analyzeresults = evaluation.process(pipeline_dict)analyze(results)```## Citing MOABB and related publicationsTo cite MOABB, you could use the following paper:&gt; Vinay Jayaram and Alexandre Barachant.&gt; [&quot;MOABB: trustworthy algorithm benchmarking for BCIs.&quot;](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/aadea0/meta)&gt; Journal of neural engineering 15.6 (2018): 066011.&gt; [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-2552/aadea0)If you publish a paper using MOABB, please contact us on [gitter][link_gitter] or open anissue, and we will add your paper to the[dedicated wiki page](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb/wiki/MOABB-bibliography).## Thank YouThank you so much (Danke schön!
