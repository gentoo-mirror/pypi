Compared to just using ``coverage run`` this plugin does some extras:* Subprocess support: you can fork or run stuff in a subprocess and will get covered without any fuss.* Xdist support: you can use all of pytest-xdist's features and still get coverage.* Consistent pytest behavior. If you run ``coverage run -m pytest`` you will have slightly different ``sys.path`` (CWD will be  in it, unlike when running ``pytest``).All features offered by the coverage package should work, either through pytest-cov's command line options orthrough coverage's config file.* Free software: MIT licenseInstallation============Install with pip::    pip install pytest-covFor distributed testing support install pytest-xdist::    pip install pytest-xdistUpgrading from ancient pytest-cov---------------------------------`pytest-cov 2.0` is using a new ``.pth`` file (``pytest-cov.pth``). You may want to manually remove the older``init_cov_core.pth`` from site-packages as it's not automatically removed.Uninstalling------------Uninstall with pip::    pip uninstall pytest-covUnder certain scenarios a stray ``.pth`` file may be left around in site-packages.* `pytest-cov 2.0` may leave a ``pytest-cov.pth`` if you installed without wheels  (``easy_install``, ``setup.py install`` etc).* `pytest-cov 1.8 or older` will leave a ``init_cov_core.pth``.Usage=====::    pytest --cov=myproj tests/Would produce a report like::    -------------------- coverage: ... ---------------------    Name                 Stmts   Miss  Cover    ----------------------------------------    myproj/__init__          2      0   100%    myproj/myproj          257     13    94%    myproj/feature4286      94      7    92%    ----------------------------------------    TOTAL                  353     20    94%Documentation=============    http://pytest-cov.rtfd.org/Coverage Data File==================The data file is erased at the beginning of testing to ensure clean data for each test run. If youneed to combine the coverage of several test runs you can use the ``--cov-append`` option to appendthis coverage data to coverage data from previous test runs.The data file is left at the end of testing so that it is possible to use normal coverage tools toexamine it.Limitations===========For distributed testing the workers must have the pytest-cov package installed.  This is needed sincethe plugin must be registered through setuptools for pytest to start the plugin on theworker.For subprocess measurement environment variables must make it from the main process to thesubprocess.  The python used by the subprocess must have pytest-cov installed.  The subprocess mustdo normal site initialisation so that the environment variables can be detected and coveragestarted.Acknowledgements================Whilst this plugin has been built fresh from the ground up it has been influenced by the work doneon pytest-coverage (Ross Lawley, James Mills, Holger Krekel) and nose-cover (Jason Pellerin) which areother coverage plugins.Ned Batchelder for coverage and its ability to combine the coverage results of parallel runs.Holger Krekel for pytest with its distributed testing support.Jason Pellerin for nose.Michael Foord for unittest2.No doubt others have contributed to these tools as well.Changelog=========4.0.0 (2022-09-28)------------------**Note that this release drops support for multiprocessing.*** `--cov-fail-under` no longer causes `pytest --collect-only` to fail  Contributed by Zac Hatfield-Dodds in `#511 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/511&gt;`_.* Dropped support for multiprocessing (mostly because `issue 82408 &lt;https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/82408&gt;`_). This feature was  mostly working but very broken in certain scenarios and made the test suite very flaky and slow.  There is builtin multiprocessing support in coverage and you can migrate to that. All you need is this in your  ``.coveragerc``::    [run]    concurrency = multiprocessing    parallel = true    sigterm = true* Fixed deprecation in ``setup.py`` by trying to import setuptools before distutils.  Contributed by Ben Greiner in `#545 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/545&gt;`_.* Removed undesirable new lines that were displayed while reporting was disabled.  Contributed by Delgan in `#540 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/540&gt;`_.* Documentation fixes.  Contributed by Andre Brisco in `#543 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/543&gt;`_  and Colin O'Dell in `#525 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/525&gt;`_.* Added support for LCOV output format via `--cov-report=lcov`. Only works with coverage 6.3+.  Contributed by Christian Fetzer in `#536 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/536&gt;`_.* Modernized pytest hook implementation.  Contributed by Bruno Oliveira in `#549 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/549&gt;`_  and Ronny Pfannschmidt in `#550 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/550&gt;`_.3.0.0 (2021-10-04)-------------------**Note that this release drops support for Python 2.7 and Python 3.5.*** Added support for Python 3.10 and updated various test dependencies.  Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in  `#500 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/500&gt;`_.* Switched from Travis CI to GitHub Actions. Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in  `#494 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/494&gt;`_ and  `#495 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/495&gt;`_.* Add a ``--cov-reset`` CLI option.  Contributed by Danilo Šegan in  `#459 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/459&gt;`_.* Improved validation of ``--cov-fail-under`` CLI option.  Contributed by ... Ronny Pfannschmidt's desire for skark in  `#480 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/480&gt;`_.* Dropped Python 2.7 support.

Contributed by Michał Bielawski in  `#481 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/481&gt;`_.* Reverted change for `toml` requirement.  Contributed by Thomas Grainger in  `#477 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/477&gt;`_.2.12.1 (2021-06-01)-------------------* Changed the `toml` requirement to be always be directly required (instead of being required through a coverage extra).  This fixes issues with pip-compile (`pip-tools#1300 &lt;https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/1300&gt;`_).  Contributed by Sorin Sbarnea in `#472 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/472&gt;`_.* Documented ``show_contexts``.  Contributed by Brian Rutledge in `#473 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/473&gt;`_.2.12.0 (2021-05-14)-------------------* Added coverage's `toml` extra to install requirements in setup.py.  Contributed by Christian Riedel in `#410 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/410&gt;`_.* Fixed ``pytest_cov.__version__`` to have the right value (string with version instead of a string  including ``__version__ =``).* Fixed license classifier in ``setup.py``.

This prevents reporting issues.  Contributed by Mateus Berardo de Souza Terra in `#433 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/433&gt;`_.* Improved sample projects (from the `examples &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/tree/master/examples&gt;`_  directory) to support running `tox -e pyXY`. Now the example configures a suffixed coverage data file,  and that makes the cleanup environment unnecessary.  Contributed by Ganden Schaffner in `#435 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/435&gt;`_.* Removed the empty `console_scripts` entrypoint that confused some Gentoo build script.

Contributed by Zac Hatfield-Dodds in `#412 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/412&gt;`_.* Fixed the ``LocalPath has no attribute startswith`` failure that occurred when using the ``pytester`` plugin  in inline mode.2.10.0 (2020-06-12)-------------------* Improved the ``--no-cov`` warning. Now it's only shown if ``--no-cov`` is present before ``--cov``.* Removed legacy pytest support. Changed ``setup.py`` so that ``pytest&gt;=4.6`` is required.2.9.0 (2020-05-22)------------------* Fixed ``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` when using Pytest 3.10.

Contributed by Harm Geerts in  `#387 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/387&gt;`_.* Changed ``--cov-append`` to handle loading previous data better  (fixes various path aliasing issues).* Various other testing improvements, github issue templates, example updates.* Fixed internal failures that are caused by tests that change the current working directory by  ensuring a consistent working directory when coverage is called.  See `#306 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/306&gt;`_ and  `coveragepy#881 &lt;https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/881&gt;`_2.8.1 (2019-10-05)------------------* Fixed `#348 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/348&gt;`_ -  regression when only certain reports (html or xml) are used then ``--cov-fail-under`` always fails.2.8.0 (2019-10-04)------------------* Fixed ``RecursionError`` that can occur when using  `cleanup_on_signal &lt;https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subprocess-support.html#if-you-got-custom-signal-handling&gt;`__ or  `cleanup_on_sigterm &lt;https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subprocess-support.html#if-you-got-custom-signal-handling&gt;`__.  See: `#294 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/294&gt;`_.  The 2.7.x releases of pytest-cov should be considered broken regarding aforementioned cleanup API.* Added compatibility with future xdist release that deprecates some internals  (match pytest-xdist master/worker terminology).  Contributed by Thomas Grainger in `#321 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/321&gt;`_* Fixed breakage that occurs when multiple reporting options are used.  Contributed by Thomas Grainger in `#338 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/338&gt;`_.* Changed internals to use a stub instead of ``os.devnull``.

Previously changing working  directory would disable coverage measurements in suprocesses.* Fixed broken handling for ``--cov-report=annotate``.2.1.0 (2015-08-23)------------------* Added support for `coverage 4.0b2`.* Added the ``--cov-append`` command line options. Contributed by Christian Ledermann  in `PR#80 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/80&gt;`_.2.0.0 (2015-07-28)------------------* Added ``--cov-fail-under``, akin to the new ``fail_under`` option in `coverage-4.0`  (automatically activated if there's a ``[report] fail_under = ...`` in ``.coveragerc``).* Changed ``--cov-report=term`` to automatically upgrade to ``--cov-report=term-missing``  if there's ``[run] show_missing = True`` in ``.coveragerc``.* Changed ``--cov`` so it can be used with no path argument (in which case the source  settings from ``.coveragerc`` will be used instead).* Fixed `.pth` installation to work in all cases (install, easy_install, wheels, develop etc).* Fixed `.pth` uninstallation to work for wheel installs.* Support for coverage 4.0.* Data file suffixing changed to use coverage's ``data_suffix=True`` option (instead of the  custom suffixing).* Avoid warning about missing coverage data (just like ``coverage.control.process_startup``).* Fixed a race condition when running with xdist (all the workers tried to combine the files).  It's possible that this issue is not present in `pytest-cov 1.8.X`.1.8.2 (2014-11-06)------------------* N/A</longdescription>
