	<longdescription>hanging_threads===============Deadlocks? Detect where your threads hang in Python... image:: https://travis-ci.org/niccokunzmann/hanging_threads.svg   :target: https://travis-ci.org/niccokunzmann/hanging_threads   :alt: Build Status.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/hanging_threads.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hanging_threads   :alt: Python Package IndexInstallation------------Install the module with pip:.. code:: bash    pip install hanging_threadsIf installing with **Windows**, open the command line program &quot;cmd&quot; and type.. code:: bash    py -m pip install hanging_threadsUsage-----Monitoring is as simple as calling the start_monitoring() function... code:: python    from hanging_threads import start_monitoring    monitoring_thread = start_monitoring()You may also pass additional parameters... code:: python    monitoring_thread = start_monitoring(seconds_frozen=10, test_interval=100)The values in the example are defaults. This mean the check will happen 10times per second. If a thread is frozen for at least 10 seconds then the stackis dumped into standard error stream. This happens again every 10 secondswhile there is no changes in the stack registered during checks. Checks are done inintervals of 100ms.Note that it makes sense to save the thread object into variable so that you orsomebody else can stop the annoying dumps if needed.For example, you may want to do this in the Python shell... code:: python    monitoring_thread.stop()Useful Stackoverflow links--------------------------- `GIL-deadlocks are not covered by this &lt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10014481/python-threads-hang#comment33263430_17744731&gt;`__- `Package requested, so this was created &lt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3443607/how-can-i-tell-where-my-python-script-is-hanging/17744556#comment69129716_17744556&gt;`__</longdescription>
