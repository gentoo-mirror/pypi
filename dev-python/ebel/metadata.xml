	<longdescription>*********************************e(BE:L) |docs| |python_versions|*********************************e(BE:L) is a Python package built for both validating and modeling information extracted from publications using `Biological Expression Language (BEL) &lt;https://language.bel.bio/&gt;`_.This software package serves a comprehensive tool for all of your BEL needs and serves to create enriched knowledge graphsfor developing and testing new theories and hypotheses.**e(BE:L)** have implemented several other knowledge bases to extend the BEL knowledge graph or map identifiers.* `BioGrid &lt;https://thebiogrid.org/&gt;`_* `ChEBI &lt;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/&gt;`_* `ClinicalTrials.gov &lt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/&gt;`_* `ClinVar &lt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/&gt;`_* `DisGeNET &lt;https://www.disgenet.org/&gt;`_* `DrugBank &lt;https://go.drugbank.com/&gt;`_* `Ensembl`_* `Expression Atlas &lt;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home&gt;`_* `GWAS Catalog &lt;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home&gt;`_* `HGNC &lt;https://www.genenames.org/&gt;`_* `IntAct`_* `Guide to PHARMACOLOGY &lt;https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/&gt;`_* `KEGG &lt;https://www.genome.jp/kegg/&gt;`_* `MirTarBase &lt;https://mirtarbase.cuhk.edu.cn/~miRTarBase/miRTarBase_2022/php/index.php&gt;`_* `Different resources from NCBI &lt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/&gt;`_* `OffSides &lt;http://tatonettilab.org/offsides/&gt;`_* `Pathway Commons &lt;https://www.pathwaycommons.org/&gt;`_* `The Human Protein Atlas &lt;https://www.proteinatlas.org/&gt;`_* `Reactome &lt;https://reactome.org/&gt;`_* `STRING &lt;https://string-db.org/&gt;`_* `UniProt`_Installation |pypi_version| |pypi_license|==========================================The easiest way to install ebel is to use `docker-compose`. See below instructions to use the docker installation.``ebel`` can be directly installed from PyPi with pip::    $ pip install ebelBut we want to encourage you to use the latest development version which can be installed with::    $ pip install git+https://github.com/e-bel/ebelPackage Requirements====================Installing OrientDB-------------------This software package is designed to work in conjunction with `OrientDB`_, a NoSQL, multi-model databasethat acts as both a graph and relational database. e(BE:L) uses OrientDB for generating the knowledge graph derived from BEL files. To getstarted with e(BE:L), first `download OrientDB`_ and get a server up and running.The first time the server is ran, you will need to create a root password. Once it is up and running, you can getstart importing BEL files into it!On Linux you can use following commands::    wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/orientechnologies/orientdb-community/3.2.2/orientdb-community-3.2.2.tar.gz    tar -xvzf orientdb-community-3.2.2.tar.gz    cd orientdb-community-3.2.2/bin    ./server.shSQL Databases--------------This package is capable of enriching the compiled knowledge graphs with a lot of external information, however, this requiresa SQL databases for storage. While, a SQLite database can be used, this is not recommended as the amount of data andcomplexity of queries will be quite slow. Additionally, SQLite will not be directly supported, the methods will be builtsuch that they should work with both SQLite and MySQL, but we will not address performance issues due to using SQLite.Instead, we recommend setting up a `MySQL server &lt;https://www.mysql.com/downloads/&gt;`_ or `MariaDB`_ to use with e(BE:L). By default, `PyMySQL &lt;https://pypi.org/project/PyMySQL/&gt;`_is installed as a driver by e(BE:L), but others can also be used.On Lunux Ubuntu you can use following command::    sudo apt install mysql-server -yor::    sudo apt install mariadb-server -yConfiguration=============Before you start working with e(BE:L), a simple to use wizard helps you to setup all configurations. Make sure OrientDB and MySQL (or MariaDB) are running. Then start the configuration wizard with::    ebel settingsThe wizard will create the needed databases and users in OrientDB and MySQL/MariaDB.Package Components==================To test the different components you find `here &lt;https://github.com/e-bel/covid19_knowledge_graph/&gt;`_ several BEL and already compiled JSON files.BEL Validation==============BEL is a domain-specific language designed to capture biological relationships in a computer- and human-readable format.The rules governing BEL statement generation can be quite complex and often mistakes are made during curation.e(BE:L) includes a grammar and syntax checker that reads through given BEL files and validates whether each statementsatisfies the guidelines provided by `BEL.bio &lt;https://language.bel.bio/&gt;`_. Should any BEL statement within the filenot adhere to the rules, a report file is created by e(BE:L) explaining the error and offering suggested fixes.You can use the following command to validate your BEL file::    $ ebel validate /path/to/bel_file.belIn a single command, you can validate your BEL file as well as generate error reports if there are errors and if thereare none, produce an importable JSON file::    $ ebel validate /path/to/bel_file.bel -r error_report.xlsx -jBEL documents should be properly formatted prior to validation. e(BE:L) contains a repair tool that will check the formatand it is highly recommended that this is used prior to validation. The repaired will overwrite the original if a new filepath is not specified. Here is an example::    $ ebel repair /path/to/bel_file.bel -n /path/to/repaired_file.belImport Process==============BEL Modeling - OrientDB-----------------------BEL files that have passed the validation process can be imported into thedatabase individually or *en masse*. During the import process, e(BE:L) automatically creates all of the relevant nodes and edgesas described in the BEL files. Additionally, e(BE:L) also automatically adds in missing nodes and edges that are known to existe.g. protein nodes with a respective RNA or gene node with have these automatically added to the graph with the appropriate ``translatedTo`` and``transcribedTo`` edges.Model Enrichment - MySQL------------------------e(BE:L) goes one step farther when compiling your BEL statements into a knowledge graph by supplementing your new graph model with information derived from severalpublicly available repositories. Data is automatically downloaded from several useful sites including `UniProt`_ ,`Ensembl`_, and `IntAct`_ and added as generic tables in your newly built database.Information from these popular repositories are then linked to the nodes and edges residing in your graph model, allowing for more complex anduseful queries to be made against your data. This data is automatically downloaded, parsed, and imported into a specified SQL database.Importing - Getting Started---------------------------e(BE:L) supports OrientDB as graph database and `MySQL &lt;https://www.mysql.com&gt;`_ and `MariaDB`_ as `RDBMS &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database&gt;`_Make sure you have downloaded/installed and running1. `OrientDB`_2.
