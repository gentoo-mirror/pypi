	<longdescription># Wagtail FootnotesAdd footnotes functionality to your Wagtail project.## Usage - Add the app to `INSTALLED_APPS`:   ```python   INSTALLED_APPS = [       ...       &quot;wagtail_footnotes&quot;,       ...   ]   ``` - Add the footnotes `urls.py` to your project's `urls.py`:   ```python   from wagtail_footnotes import urls as footnotes_urls   urlpatterns = [       ...       path(&quot;footnotes/&quot;, include(footnotes_urls)),       ...   ]   ```   Note: The URL has to be defined as above as it is currently hardcoded in the Javascript. - Update your page models to show the footnotes field:   ```python   class InformationPage(BasePage):        ...        content_panels = [            ...            InlinePanel(&quot;footnotes&quot;, label=&quot;Footnotes&quot;),        ]   ``` - Update your `RichTextBlock`s     - Add `&quot;footnotes&quot;` to the `features` arg for each `RichTextBlock` that you want to have this functionality    - You will also need to change any `RichTextBlock`s to `wagtail_footnotes.blocks.RichTextBlockWithFootnotes` - Update your page templates to include `{% include &quot;wagtail_footnotes/includes/footnotes.html&quot; %}` - Make and run migrations:   ```   ./manage.py makemigrations   ./manage.py migrate   ```## Settings - `WAGTAIL_FOOTNOTES_TEXT_FEATURES`   - Default: `[&quot;bold&quot;, &quot;italic&quot;, &quot;link&quot;]`   - Use this to update a list of Rich Text features allowed in the footnote text.## Common issues - I click on the `Fn` button in the editor and it stops working    - This is likely because the URL in the JS does not match the URL of the footnotes view. Check the URL in `wagtail_footnotes/static/footnotes/js/footnotes.js` matches the URL you set. - `NoneType` error when rendering page.    - Make sure you are rendering the field in the template using `{% include_block page.field_name %}`</longdescription>
