	<longdescription># Query Pandas-like Dataframes Using SQLQPD let you run the same SQL (`SELECT` for now) statements on different computing frameworks with pandas-like interfaces.Currently, it support [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Dask](https://dask.org/) and [Ray](https://ray.io/)(via [Modin](https://github.com/modin-project/modin) on Ray).QPD directly translates SQL into pandas-like operations to run on the backend computing frameworks, so it can be significantlyfaster than some other approaches, for example, to dump pandas dataframes into SQLite, run SQL and convert the result back intoa pandas dataframe. However, the top priorities of QPD are **correctness** and **consistency**. It ensures the results ofimplemented SQL features following SQL convention, and it ensures consistent behavior regardless of backend computing frameworks.A typical case is `groupby().agg()`. In pandas or pandas like frameworks, if any of the group keys is null, the defaultbehavior is to drop that group, however, in SQL they are not dropped. QPD follows the SQL way.QPD syntax is a subset of the intersection of [Spark SQL](https://spark.apache.org/sql/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).The correctness and consistency are extensively tested against SQLite. Practically, Spark SQL and SQLite are highly consistenton both syntax and behavior. So, in other words, QPD enables you to run common SQLs and get the same result on Pandas, SQLite, Spark, Dask,Ray and other backends that QPD will support in the future.SQL is one of the most important data processing languages. It is very *scale agnostic*, and one of the major goals of the Fugue projectis to enrich SQL and make SQL *platform agnostic*. QPD, as a subproject of Fugue, focuses on running SQL on pandas-like frameworks, it isan essential component to achieve the ultimate goal.## InstallationQPD can be installed from PyPI:```bashpip install qpd # install qpd + pandas```If you want to use Ray or Dask as the backend, you will need to install QPD with one of the targets:```bashpip install qpd[dask] # install qpd + dask[dataframe]pip install qpd[ray] # install qpd + raypip install qpd[all] # install all dependencies above```## Using QPD### On Pandas```pythonfrom qpd_pandas import run_sql_on_pandasimport pandas as pddf = pd.DataFrame([[0,1],[2,3],[0,5]], columns=[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;])res = run_sql_on_pandas(&quot;SELECT a, SUM(b) AS b, COUNT(*) AS c FROM df GROUP BY a&quot;, {&quot;df&quot;: df})print(res)```### On DaskPlease read [this](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/quickstart.html) to learn the bestpractice for initializing dask.```pythonfrom qpd_dask import run_sql_on_daskimport dask.dataframe as pdimport pandasdf = pd.from_pandas(pandas.DataFrame([[0,1],[2,3],[0,5]], columns=[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]))res = run_sql_on_dask(&quot;SELECT a, SUM(b) AS b, COUNT(*) AS c FROM df GROUP BY a&quot;, {&quot;df&quot;: df})print(res.compute())  # dask dataframe is lazy, you need to call compute```### On RayPlease read [this](https://docs.ray.io/en/ray-0.3.1/api.html#starting-ray) to learn the bestpractice for initializing ray. And read [this](https://modin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_modin.html)for initializing modin + ray.*Please don't use dask as modin backend if you want to use QPD, it's not tested*```pythonimport rayray.init()from qpd_ray import run_sql_on_rayimport modin.pandas as pddf = pd.DataFrame([[0,1],[2,3],[0,5]], columns=[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;])res = run_sql_on_ray(&quot;SELECT a, SUM(b) AS b, COUNT(*) AS c FROM df GROUP BY a&quot;, {&quot;df&quot;: df})print(res)```### Ignoring Case in SQLBy default, QPD requires users to use upper cased keywords, otherwise syntax errors will be raised.However if you really don't like this behavior, you can turn it off, the parameter is `ignore_case`,here is an example:```pythonfrom qpd_pandas import run_sql_on_pandasimport pandas as pddf = pd.DataFrame([[0,1],[2,3],[0,5]], columns=[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;])res = run_sql_on_pandas(    &quot;select a, sum(b) as b, count(*) as c from df group by a&quot;,    {&quot;df&quot;: df}, ignore_case=True)print(res)```## Things to clarify### QPD on Spark (Koalas)?No, that will not happen. QPD is using Spark SQL[syntax file](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/antlr4/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/parser/SqlBase.g4).Spark SQL is highly optimized. If we create a Koalas backend, correctness and consistency canbe guaranteed, but there will be no performance advantage. So for Spark, please use Spark SQL.If you use Fugue SQL on Spark backend, it will also directly use Spark to run the SQL statements.We don't see the value to make QPD run on Spark.## Update History* 0.4.4: Remove triad version constraint* 0.4.3: Fix packing issue* 0.4.2: Refactor to use the latest triad, fix packaging issues* 0.4.1: Make Pandas 2 compatible* 0.4.0: Support arbitrary column name* 0.2.6: Update pandas indexer import* 0.2.5: Update antlr to 4.9* 0.2.4: Fix a bug: set operations will alter the input dataframe to add columns* 0.2.3: Refactor and extract out PandasLikeUtils class* 0.2.2: Accept constant select without `FROM`, `SELECT 1 AS a, 'b' AS b`* &lt;= 0.2.1: Pandas, Dask, Ray SQL support</longdescription>
