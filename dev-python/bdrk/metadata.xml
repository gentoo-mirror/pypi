	<longdescription>[Bedrock](https://bedrock.basis-ai.com) helps data scientists own the end-to-end deployment of machine learning workflows. `bdrk` is the official client library for interacting with APIs on Bedrock platform.## DocumentationFull documentation and tutorials on Bedrock can be found [here](https://docs.basis-ai.com/)## UsageIn order to use `bdrk`, you need to register an account with Basis AI. Please email `contact@basis-ai.com` to get started. Once an account is created, you will be issued a personal API token that you can use to authenticate with Bedrock.### Installing Bedrock clientYou can install Bedrock client library from PyPi with the following command. We recommend running it in a virtual environment to prevent potential dependency conflicts.```bashpip install bdrk```Note that the client library is officially supported for python 3.7 and above.#### Installing optional dependenciesThe following optional dependencies can be installed to enable additional featues.Command line support:```bashpip install bdrk[cli]```Model monitoring support:```bashpip install boxkite```### Setting up your environmentOnce installed, you need to add a well formed `bedrock.hcl` configuration file in your project's root directory. The configuration file specifies which script to run for training and deployment as well as their respective base Docker images. You can find an example directory layout [here](https://github.com/basisai/churn_prediction).When using the module locally, you may need to define the following environment variables for `bdrk` to make API calls to Bedrock. These variables will be automatically set on your workload container when running in cluster.```bashexport BEDROCK_API_DOMAIN=https://api.bdrk.aiexport BEDROCK_API_TOKEN=&lt;your personal API token&gt;```### Training on BedrockThe `bdrk` library provides utility functions for your training runs.#### Logging training metricsYou can easily export training metrics to Bedrock by adding logging code to `train.py`. The example below demonstrates logging charts and metrics for visualisation on Bedrock platform.```pythonimport bdrkbdrk.init()with bdrk.start_run():    bdrk.log_metric(&quot;Accuracy&quot;, 0.97)    bdrk.log_binary_classifier_metrics([0, 1, 1], [0.1, 0.7, 0.9])```#### Logging feature and inference distributionYou may use the model monitoring service to save the distribution of input and model output data to a local file. The default path is `/artefact/histogram.prom` so as to bundle the computed distribution together with the model artefact it trained from. When trained on Bedrock, the zipped `/artefact` directory will be uploaded to user's blob storage bucket in the workload cluster.```pythonimport pandas as pdfrom boxkite.monitoring.service import ModelMonitoringServicefrom sklearn.svm import SVC# User code to load training datafeatures = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': [3, 2, 1]})model = SVC(probability=True)model.fit(features, [False, True, False])inference = model.predict_proba(features)[:, 0]ModelMonitoringService.export_text(    features=features.iteritems(),    inference=inference.tolist(),)```#### Logging explainability and fairness metricsBedrock offers facility to generate and log explainability and fairness (XAFAI) metrics. `bdrk` provides an easy to use API and native integration with Bedrock platform to visualize XAFAI metrics. All data is stored in your environment's blob storage to ensure nothing leaves your infrastructure. Under the hood it uses [shap](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) library to provide both global and individual explainability, and [AI Fairness 360 toolkit](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360) to compare model behaviors between groups of interest for fairness assessment.```python# As part of your train.pyfrom bdrk.model_analyzer import ModelAnalyzer, ModelTypes# Background data is used to simulate &quot;missing&quot; features to measure the impact.# It is limited to maximum of 5000 rows by default to speed up analysis.background = x_train# Tree model: xgboost, lightgbm. Other types of model, including Tensorflow# and Pytorch are also supported.analyzer = ModelAnalyzer(  model,  'credit_risk_tree_model',  model_type=ModelTypes.TREE,).train_features(background).test_features(x_validation)# Metrics are calculated and uploaded to blob storageanalyzer.analyze()```### Training locallyThe `bdrk` library supports tracking runs outside of Bedrock platform.```pythonimport bdrkbdrk.init(project_id=&quot;test-project&quot;)with bdrk.start_run(pipeline_id=&quot;local-pipeline&quot;, environment_id=&quot;canary-dev&quot;):    bdrk.download_model(model_id=&quot;colour&quot;, version=1)    # ...    # Training code goes here    # ...    bdrk.log_params({&quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5, &quot;l5_ratio&quot;: 0.5})    bdrk.log_metrics(metrics={&quot;metric_1&quot;: 0.5, &quot;metric_2&quot;: 0.8})    bdrk.log_binary_classifier_metrics(actual=[0, 1, 1], probability=[0, 0.1, 0.5])    bdrk.log_model(&quot;./train.zip&quot;)```Under the hood, `bdrk.backend` module exposes APIs for interacting with Bedrock platform.```pythonfrom bdrk.backend.v1 import ApiClient, Configuration, PipelineApifrom bdrk.backend.v1.models import (    PipelineResourcesSchema,    TrainingPipelineRunSchema,)configuration = Configuration()configuration.api_key[&quot;X-Bedrock-Access-Token&quot;] = &quot;MY-TOKEN&quot;configuration.host = &quot;https://api.bdrk.ai&quot;api_client = ApiClient(configuration)pipeline_api = PipelineApi(api_client)pipeline = pipeline_api.get_training_pipeline_by_id(pipeline_id=&quot;MY-PIPELINE&quot;)run_schema = TrainingPipelineRunSchema(    environment_public_id=&quot;MY-ENVIRONMENT&quot;,    resources=PipelineResourcesSchema(cpu=&quot;500m&quot;, memory=&quot;200M&quot;),    script_parameters={&quot;MYPARAM&quot;: &quot;1.23&quot;},)run = pipeline_api.run_training_pipeline(    pipeline_id=pipeline.public_id, training_pipeline_run_schema=run_schema)```### Monitoring models in productionAt serving time, users may import `boxkite` library to track various model performance metrics. Anomalies in these metrics can help inform users about model rot.#### Logging predictionsThe model monitoring service may be instantiated in serve.py to log every prediction request for offline analysis. The following example demonstrates how to enable prediction logging in a typical Flask app.```pythonfrom boxkite.monitoring.service import ModelMonitoringServicefrom flask import Flask, requestfrom sklearn.svm import SVC# User code to load trained modelmodel = SVC(probability=True)model.fit([[1, 3], [2, 2], [3, 1]], [False, True, False])app = Flask(__name__)monitor = ModelMonitoringService()@app.route(&quot;/&quot;, methods=[&quot;POST&quot;])def predict():    # User code to load features    features = [2.1, 1.8]    score = model.predict_proba([features])[:, 0].item()    monitor.log_prediction(        request_body=request.json,        features=features,        output=score,    )    return {&quot;True&quot;: score}```The logged predictions are persisted in low cost blob store in the workload cluster with a maximum TTL of 1 month. The blob store is partitioned by the endpoint id and the event timestamp according to the following structure: `models/predictions/{endpoint_id}/2020-01-22/1415_{logger_id}-{replica_id}.txt`.- Endpoint id is the first portion of your domain name hosted on Bedrock- Replica id is the name of your model server pod- Logger id is a Bedrock generated name that's unique to the log collector podThese properties are injected automatically into your model server container as environment variables.To minimize latency of request handling, all predictions are logged asynchronously in a separate thread pool. We measured the overhead along critical path to be less than 1 ms per request.#### Tracking feature and inference driftIf training distribution metrics are present in `/artefact` directory, the model monitoring service will also track real time distribution of features and inference results. This is done using the same `log_prediction` call so users don't need to further instrument their serving code.In order to export the serving distribution metrics, users may add a new `/metrics` endpoint to their Flask app. By default, all metrics are exported in Prometheus exposition format. The example code below shows how to extend the logging predictions example to support this use case.```python@app.route(&quot;/metrics&quot;, methods=[&quot;GET&quot;])def get_metrics():    &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns real time feature values recorded by prometheus    &quot;&quot;&quot;    body, content_type = monitor.export_http(        params=request.args.to_dict(flat=False),        headers=request.headers,    )    return Response(body, content_type=content_type)```When deployed in your workload cluster, the `/metrics` endpoint is automatically scraped by Prometheus every minute to store the latest metrics as timeseries data.# Changelog## v0.9.2 (2021-10-18)- Fix: Resolve type mismatch when matching fairness config and input data.
