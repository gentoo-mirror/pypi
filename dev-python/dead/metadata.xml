Here's a few things it's not good at:- functions which implement an interface are often marked as unused- metaclass magic is often marked as unused (enums, model classes, etc.)### suppressing `dead`The `# dead: disable` comment will tell `dead` to ignoreany line which has reportedly dead code.### is this project dead?_maybe._</longdescription>
