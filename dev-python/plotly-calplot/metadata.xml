	<longdescription># Calendar Heatmap with PlotlyMaking it easier to visualize and costumize time relevant or time series data with plotly interaction.New to the library? Read [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@brunorosilva/5fc322125db7).This plot is a very similar to the contribuitions available on Github and Gitlab profile pages and to [Calplot](https://github.com/tomkwok/calplot) - which is a pyplot implementation of the calendar heatmap, thus it is not interactive right off the bat.The first mention I could find of this plot being made with plotly was in [this forum post](https://community.plotly.com/t/colored-calendar-heatmap-in-dash/10907/16) and it got my attention as something that should be easily available to anyone.# Installation``` bashpip install plotly-calplot```# ExamplesIn [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@brunorosilva/5fc322125db7) I covered lot's of usage methods for this library.``` pythonfrom plotly_calplot import calplotfig = calplot(df, x=&quot;date&quot;, y=&quot;value&quot;)fig.show()# you can also adjust layout and your usual plotly stuff```&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/brunorosilva/plotly-calplot/blob/main/assets/images/example.png?raw=true&quot;&gt;</longdescription>
