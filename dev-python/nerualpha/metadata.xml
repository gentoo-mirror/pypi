	<longdescription>## To build the SDK locally:Because I've been experiencing some issues with the build process on `Mac M1`, I decided to use docker to install dependencies and build the SDK. I've created a `Dockerfile` that can be used to build the SDK. I mount the current directory to the container to have the artifacts after the build process available on the host machine in `/dist` folder.The `Dockerfile` is located in the `python` directory. To build the SDK, run the following command:```bash# Build the docker imagedocker build -t neru-sdk-python .``````bash# Build the SDKmake build```</longdescription>
