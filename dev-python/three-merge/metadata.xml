This library performs merges at a character level, as opposed to most VCS systems, which opt for a line-based approach.## InstallingTo install three-merge, you can use both conda or pip package managers:```bash# Using conda (Recommended)conda install three-merge -c spyder-ide# Using pippip install three-merge```## DependenciesThis package depends on [diff-match-patch](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch) to compute and track the differences across the source and target strings with respect to the base one.## Installing locallyTo install and develop three-merge locally, you will need to install diff-match-patch:```bash# Using condaconda install diff-match-patch# Using pippip install diff-match-patch```Then, you can install the package locally using pip:```bashpip install -U -e .```## Running testsWe use pytest to run tests as it follows:```bashpytest -x -v three_merge/tests```## Package usageThree-merge provides a ``merge`` function to merge changes from two strings (source, target) with respect a original string (base). This library is able to handle additions, deletions and preserved sections across both strings, while detecting and highlighting possible merge conflicts (like Git).```python# Package importfrom three_merge import merge# Strings have non-conflicting additionsbase = '123456789101112'source = '0123456789101112'target = '12345678910111213'# merged = '012345678910111213'merged = merge(source, target, base)# Strings have an addition conflictbase = '123456789101112'source = '123a456789101112'target = '123b456789101112'# merged = '123&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ++ a ======= ++ b &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;456789101112'merged = merge(source, target, base)# Strings have non-conflicting addition/deletionsbase = '123456789101112'source = '123456789ab101112'target = '123789101112'# merged = '123789ab101112'merged = merge(source, target, base)```For more examples, please take a look at our [tests](https://github.com/spyder-ide/three-merge/blob/master/three_merge/tests/test_merge.py).## ChangelogPlease see our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/spyder-ide/three-merge/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file to learn more about our new features and improvements.## Contribution guidelinesWe follow PEP8 and PEP257 for all Python modules. We use MyPy type annotations for all functions and classes declared on this package. Feel free to send a PR or create an issue if you have any problem/question.</longdescription>
