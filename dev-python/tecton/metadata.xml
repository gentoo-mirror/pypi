It helps automate real-time decision making like fraud detection, product recommendations, and search result ranking in production applications.Tecton is a fully-managed feature platform built to orchestrate the complete lifecycle of features, from transformation to online serving, with enterprise-grade SLAs.With Tecton, you can:- Define and manage features using code in a git repository.- Automatically compute and orchestrate batch, streaming, and real-time feature  transformations.- Store and serve feature data for training and inference.- Share, discover, and manage access to features.# Contents of the `tecton` PyPI packageThe `tecton` PyPI package bundles Tecton's Python SDK, which is used for defining and testing feature pipelines and services, and generating datasets for training and batch inference. For more information, see the [SDK reference](https://docs.tecton.ai/api-reference/index.html).# Getting started resourcesTo get started using Tecton, see these resources, which are found in the [documentation](https://docs.tecton.ai/):* [Machine Learning Application Concepts](https://docs.tecton.ai/docs/introduction/machine-learning-application-concepts)* [Tecton Concepts](https://docs.tecton.ai/docs/introduction/tecton-concepts)* [Setting up Tecton](https://docs.tecton.ai/docs/category/setting-up-tecton)* [Tecton Fundamentals Tutorial](https://docs.tecton.ai/docs/tutorials/tecton-fundamentals/)# LicenseCopyright (2023) Tecton, Inc.
