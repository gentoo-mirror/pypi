From [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub &quot;Multi-user version of the Notebook&quot;) to Cloud environments with[Dask Gateway](https://docs.dask.org/ &quot;Parallel computing in Python&quot;).QHub is an open source tool that enables users to build and maintain cost-effective and scalable compute/data science platforms on [HPC](#qhub-hpc) or on [Kubernetes](#qhub) withminimal DevOps experience.**This repository details the [QHub](https://qhub.dev/ &quot;Official QHub docs&quot;) (Kubernetes) version.**Not sure what to choose? Check out our [Setup Initialization](docs/source/installation/setup.md) page.## QHub HPCVersion of QHub based on OpenHPC.&gt; NOTE: The tool is currently under development. Curious? Check out the [Qhub HPC](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub-hpc) repository.## QHubThe Kubernetes version of QHub is built using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Helm](https://helm.sh/), and[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions). Terraform handles the build, change, and versioning of the infrastructure. Helm helps to define, install,and manage [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/ &quot;Automated container deployment, scaling, and management&quot;). GitHub Actions is used to automatically create commits when theconfiguration file (`qhub-config.yaml`) is rendered, as well as to kick off the deployment action.QHub aims to abstract all these complexities for its users. Hence, it is not necessary to know any of the above mentioned technologies to have your project successfully deployed.&gt; TLDR: If you know GitHub and feel comfortable generating and using API keys, you should have all it takes to deploy and maintain your system without the need for a dedicated&gt; DevOps team. No need to learn Kubernetes, Terraform, or Helm.### :cloud: Cloud ProvidersQHub offers out-of-the-box support for [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), Amazon [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/),[GCP](https://cloud.google.com/ &quot;Google Cloud Provider&quot;), and Microsoft [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).![High-level illustration of QHub architecture](docs/source/images/qhub-cloud_architecture.png)For more details, check out the release [blog post](https://www.quansight.com/post/announcing-qhub).## :computer: Installation### Pre-requisites- QHub is supported by macOS and Linux operating systems (Windows is **NOT** currently supported).- Compatible with Python 3.7+. New to Python? We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).- Adoption of virtual environments ([`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), [`pipenv`](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) or  [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)) is also encouraged.### Install QHubTo install QHub type the following commands in your command line:- Install using `conda`:  ```bash  conda install -c conda-forge qhub  ```- Install using `pip`:  ```bash  pip install qhub  ```Once finished, you can check QHub's version (and additional CLI args) by typing:```bashqhub --help```If successful, the CLI output will be similar to the following:```bashusage: qhub [-h] [-v] {deploy,destroy,render,init,validate} ...QHub command linepositional arguments:  {deploy,destroy,render,init,validate}                        QHuboptional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -v, --version         QHub version```## :label: UsageQHub requires the setting of environment variables to automate the deployments fully. For details on how to obtain those variables, check the[installation guide](docs/source/installation/installation.md) in the docs.Once all the necessary credentials are gathered and set as [UNIX environment variables](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-set-and-list-environment-variables-in-linux/), QHub can bedeployed in under 20 minutes using:```bashqhub init   ... # generates initial config file and optionally automates deployment stepsqhub deploy ... # creates and configures the cloud infrastructure```## :question: Questions?Have a look at our [FAQ](docs/source/user_guide/faq.md) to see if your query has been answered.We separate the queries for QHub into:- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/discussions) used to raise discussions about a subject, such as: &quot;What is the recommended way to do X with QHub?&quot;- [Issues](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/issues/new/choose) for queries, bug reporting, feature requests,documentation, etc.&gt; We work around the clock to make QHub better, but sometimes your query might take a while to get a reply. We apologise in advance and ask you to please, be patient :pray:.## :book: Code of ConductTo guarantee a welcoming and friendly community, we require contributors to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Quansight/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).## :gear: Installing the Development version of QHubTo install the latest developer version (unstable) use:```bashpip install git+https://github.com/Quansight/qhub.git@dev```## :raised_hands: ContributionsThinking about contributing? Check out our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).## Ongoing SupportThe `v0.4.0` release introduced many changes that will irrevocably break your deployment if you attempt an inplace upgrade; for details see our[RELEASE](RELEASE.md#release-v040---march-17-2022) notes. In order to focus on the future direction of the project, we have decided as a team that we will provide **limited** support for older versions. Any new user is encouraged to use `v0.4.0` or greater.If you're using an older version of QHub and would like professional support, please reach out to Quansight.## License[QHub is BSD3 licensed](LICENSE).</longdescription>
