	<longdescription># Procuret PythonA Python library for interfacing with Procuret API.[Procuret](https://procuret.com) is abusiness - to - business payment platform that allows customers to payfor purchases over time, while the supplier is paid upfront.## Contents1. [Installation](#installation)2. [Documentation](#documentation)3. [Support](#support)## InstallationProcuret Python may be [installed via PIP](https://pypi.org/project/procuret):```bash$ pip install procuret```To update Procuret Python to the latest version, use `pip --upgrade`:```bash$ pip install --upgrade procuret```## DocumentationProcuret Python offers a library of classes that map to services providedby the Procuret API.### `Session`Sessions are the means of authenticating requests to the Procuret API. Allrequests to Procuret API, save for those creating Sessions themselves, requirea Session.In Procuret Python, the `Session` class will handle all authentication for you.For example, it will compute the SHA256 signature that must be includedin your HTTP headers.#### Properties- `.session_id: int` - A 63-bit positive integer uniquely identifying this`Session`. `Session` will include this number in requests to Procuret API, sothat Procuret API can identify you.- `.api_key` - A 192-bit random number encoded in urlsafe base64 and generatedin a cryptographically secure manner. `Session` will use this key to sign yourrequests to Procuret API using the SHA256 algorithm.#### Methods##### `.create_with_email(...) -&gt; Session`Use `.create_with_email()` to create a new `Session`. This is analogous to&quot;logging in&quot; to the Procuret API.###### Parameters1. `email: str` - Your account email2. `plaintext_secret: str` - Your plaintext passphrase3. `perspective: Perspective` - an instance of `Perspective`###### Example Usage```pythonsession = Session.create_with_email(    email='me@somedomain.com',    plaintext_secret='excellent passphrase',    perspective=Perspective.SUPPLIER)```### `InstalmentLink``InstalmentLink` facilitates the creation of customised links to the ProcuretInstalment Product (PIP). PIP allows a customer Business to pay for a purchaseover time, while you the Supplier are paid upfront.When you create an `InstalmentLink`, you can ask Procuret to send an emailto the customer Business on your behalf.#### Properties- `.invitee_email: str` - The email address you associated with the link- `.invoice_amount: Decimal` - The invoice amount presented by the link- `.invoice_identifier: str` - The invoice ID presented by the link- `.url: str` - The URL of the link#### Methods##### `.create(...) -&gt; InstalmentLink`###### Parameters1. `supplier: Union[int, EntityHeadline]` - Either the unique integeridentifier of your Supplier entity in Procuret, or an instead of`EntityHeadline` describing your Supplier entity.2. `invoice_amount: Decimal` - The amount that you wish to charge the customer,in Australian dollars.3. `invoice_email: str` - The email address you wish to associate with thislink.4. `invoice_identifier: str` - Your own identifier for the invoice. Forexample, you might use an invoice number from your accounting system.5. `communication: CommunicationOption` - An instance of `CommunicationOption`,which will tell Procuret API what you want it to do with the supplied emailaddress.6. `session: Session` - An instance of `Session`, which will be used toauthenticate your request.###### Example usage```python# First we get a Session. In this case we authenticate with email and# passphrase. In a real integration, you might store the Session elsehwhere.session = Session.create_with_email(    email=email,    plaintext_secret=secret,    perspective=Perspective.SUPPLIER)# Now we use the Session in an InstalmentLink.create() call, along with# the parameters describing the link. By supplying# CommunicationOption.EMAIL_CUSTOMER, we tell Procuret that we would like# Procuret to send an email to the customer on our behalf inviting them# to pay using the link.link = InstalmentLink.create(    supplier=supplier_id,    invoice_amount=Decimal('422.42'),    invitee_email='someone@great-domain.org',    invoice_identifier='T 055',    communication=CommunicationOption.EMAIL_CUSTOMER,    session=session)```### `Perspective`Perspective is an enumeration of possible angles from which a clientcan engage with Procuret. If you wish to use Procuret services fromthe perspective of a Supplier, you will create a `Session` with the`Perspective.SUPPLIER` case.#### Cases- `.SUPPLIER`- `.BUSINESS`### `CommunicationOption`An enumeration of instructions you can send Procuret in some contexts, totell it how you wish for it to contact (or not contact) the a customer.#### Cases- `.EMAIL_CUSTOMER` - Procuret will contact the customer by email- `.DO_NOT_CONTACT_CUSTOMER` - Procuret will not try to contact the customer## SupportPlease contact us anytime at [support@procuret.com](mailto:support@procuet.com)with any questions.
