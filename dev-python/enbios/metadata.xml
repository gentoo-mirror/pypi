	<longdescription># Enbios 2This a ground up new implementation of enbios.Compared to the original version of enbios, this version is more flexible does not make it's own LCA calculations, butuses brightway2 for that.The main functionality of enbios2 is currently to run experiments, which are described a set of (brightway) activities aset of methods and a set of scenarios, which contain demand for the given activities.In addition to get the results of the scenarios in the dendrogram (....) the user can also define a hierarchy, whichcontains the activities at the bottom.Enbios 2 is a python package (https://pypi.org/project/enbios/), which can be installed with pip.## Installation(windows)`python -m venv venv`(linux)`python3.9 -m venv venv`Activate the environment with(windows)`venv\Scripts\activate`(linux)`source venv/bin/activate`Install enbios2 with(windows)`python -m pip install enbios`(linux)`python3 -m pip install enbios`## DemosThe repository contains a few notebooks (require jupyter notebook) in the demos folder.[Getting started](https://github.com/LIVENlab/enbios/blob/main/enbios2/demos/intro.ipynb)[Plotting results](https://github.com/LIVENlab/enbios/blob/main/enbios2/demos/plot_results.ipynb)[Sorting the results in alternative hierarchies](https://github.com/LIVENlab/enbios/blob/main/enbios2/demos/multiple_hierarchies.ipynb)[Splitting the configuration](https://github.com/LIVENlab/enbios/blob/main/enbios2/demos/multiple_config_files.ipynb)[Working with trees](https://github.com/LIVENlab/enbios/blob/main/enbios2/demos/tree.ipynb)## Experiment configuration json schemaThe json schema for the experiment configuration can be found here:https://github.com/LIVENlab/enbios/blob/main/data/schema/experiment.schema.gen.jsonThis schema, provides the structure of the experiment configuration, which is used to run the experiments.Note, that there will be additional validations when the experiment is constructed (e.g. existence of brightway project,databases, activities).## Environment variables2 environmental variables are used by enbios2:- `CONFIG_FILE`: This variable can be used to specify the location of the configuration file (json). If experiment is  initialized without any parameter (configuration data or file location), the configuration is read from this path.- `RUN_SCENARIOS`: This variable can be used to specify the scenarios to run when `experiment_object.run()` is called.  Setting the environmental variable overwrites the value set in the configuration file (`config.run_scenarios`). This  variable should be formatted as a json array, with the aliases of the scenarios that should  run. `e.g. '[&quot;Scenario 0&quot;]'` (indexed default aliases, when no aliases are specified in the configuration file for the  scenarios).# What is ENBIOSENBIOS (Environmental and Bioeconomic System Analysis) is an assessment framework designed for the assessment of the **environmental impacts and resource use of energy pathways resulting from energy system optimization models (ESOMs)**.It integrates Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Social Metabolism Assessment using the Multi-Scale Integrated Assessmentof Socio-Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM). It has been been co-designed with decision makers and energy modellers.The related python package [`enbios`](https://pypi.org/project/enbios/) takes data on energy system design and impactassessment methods to return a characterization matrix filled with bioeconomic and environmental indicators.More information on the roots of the framework and version 1 of the software can be found in [Deliverable 2.2]() ofthe [SENTINEL](https://sentinel.energy) project. Curently, we have upgraded to version 2 of the software usingBrightway2 for LCA analysis and inventory. Samples can be consultedin [deliverable 2.2](https://zenodo.org/record/7994038) of the [SEEDS](https://seeds-project.org/) project### Data inputs- Data on electricity production and power capacity from an energy model  -Inputs from EuroCalliope model are accepted as is.    - We are currently working in the integration with the TIMES model for the project LIVEN.- LCA inventories in .spold format- Methods of analysis### OutputsFor each energy function and technology:- Environmental impact indicators from the most used LCIA methods (Recipe2016, CML, AWARE, etc.)- Environmental externalization rates- Raw Material Recycling rates and Supply risk### Features- Integration of LCA and MuSIASEM evaluation methods- Import of .spold LCA inventory data to a multi-level tree-like setting- Library of impact assessment methods based on LCIA- New impact assessment methods developed for raw materials and circularity- Consideration of externalized environmental impacts- Takes data from the friendly-data package (other formats under development)- High level methods to quickly obtain/refresh analyses## People* [Ramin Soleymani](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ramin-soleymani-4703b17). -[ICTA-UAB](https://www.uab.cat/icta/)* [Miquel Sierra Montoya](https://portalrecerca.uab.cat/en/persons/miquel-sierra-i-montoya). -[ICTA-UAB](https://www.uab.cat/icta/)* [Alexander de Tom√°s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-de-tom%C3%A1s-pascual-a85348185/). -[ICTA-UAB](https://www.uab.cat/icta/)* [Cristina Madrid-Lopez](https://portalrecerca.uab.cat/en/persons/cristina-madrid-lopez-3). - [ICTA-UAB](https://www.uab.cat/icta/)## Contact- For questions about the enbios framework, please contact [cristina.madrid@uab.cat](mailto:cristina.madrid@uab.cat).## AcknowledgementsENBIOS is developed by the [LIVENlab](https://livenlab.org/), a research lab of thethe [SosteniPra](https://www.sostenipra.cat/) Research group, at [ICTA-UAB](https://www.uab.cat/icta/).The first verion was built in collaboration with the Technical Institute of the CanaryIslands ([ITC](https://www.itccanarias.org/web/es/)) and based on the Nexus Information System developed within theHorizon 2020 project [MAGIC-nexus](https://magic-nexus.eu/) and the LCA-MuSIASEM integration protocol developed in theMarie Curie project [IANEX](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/623593). This early development was funded by wtheHorizon 2020 project Sustainable Energy Transitions Laboratory ([SENTINEL](https://sentinel.energy&gt;), GA 837089).The second version of `enbios` is in development with funds from the Spanish Research Agency  (AEI) and the EuropeanComission (CINEA):* [SEEDS](https://seeds-project.org/) project with AEI grant PCI2020-120710-2 funds the ENBIOS 2 build based on  Brightway framework, adding inventory manipulation to match the mixes of the energy scenarios* LIVEN project with AEI grant PID2020-119565RJ-I00 funds the regionalization and conection with the TIMES energy model* [JUSTWIND4ALL](https://justwind4all.eu/) project with Horizon Europe grant 101083936 funds the development of a higher  resolution module for wind energy assessment, including new wind-specific holistic assessment methods.</longdescription>
