It is a set of tools and services thatallow you to build a pipeline that can take a document, extract the content, and then process it to extract theinformation you need.It is built on a set of core principles:* **Document Centric** - Kodexa is built around the idea of a document. A document is a collection of content  nodes that are connected together. This is a powerful model that allows you to build pipelines that can  extract content from a wide range of sources.* **Pipeline Oriented** - Kodexa is built around the idea of a pipeline. A pipeline is a series of steps that  can be executed on a document. This allows you to build a pipeline that can extract content from a wide range  of sources.* **Extensible** - Kodexa is built around the idea of a pipeline. A pipeline is a series of steps that can be executed  on a document. This allows you to build a pipeline that can extract content from a wide range of sources.* **Label Driven** - Kodexa focuses on the idea of labels. Labels are a way to identify content within a document  and then use that content to drive the processing of the document.# Command Line ToolsThis repository contains the command line tools for Kodexa. The tools are the primary way to interact with Kodexa. Itallows you to configure components and manage aspects of your Kodexa Platform installation.## Documentation &amp; ExamplesDocumentation is available at the [Kodexa Documentation Portal](https://docs.kodexa.com)## Set-upWe use poetry to manage our dependencies, so you can install them with:    poetry installYou can then run the tests with:    poetry run pytest# ContributingWe welcome contributions to the Kodexa platform.
