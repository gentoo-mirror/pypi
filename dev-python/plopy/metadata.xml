	<longdescription>plopy=====A program for making data plotting with matplotlib easily customizable in a GUI.Features--------- Intelligent data file parsing   - Automatically skips over headers (or any line that cannot be converted to ``float`` or ``datetime``)   - Supports many date formats in input automatically using ``dateutil.parser``   - Works with comma-separated and/or whitespace-separated input files- Graph configuration: line style, color, points, legend- Dialogs to create multiple axes and assign lines to them- Supports all output formats supported by ``matplotlib``  (``.png``, ``.jpg``, ``.pdf`` ... )Installation------------After installing `Python 3&lt;https://python.org/downloads/&gt;`_, run the command ``pip install plopy``You can also `try it online&lt;https://repl.it/@Finnventor/import-plopy-demo?lite=true&gt;`_ on repl.it,but that loads slowly and is not recommended for normal use.Usage-----To open the GUI, run the command ``python -m plopy``, or alsopreselect files by appending their paths to the command(``python -m plopy data.csv log.txt`` ... ).``plopy`` can also be controlled from a script.Use ``plopy.add_file`` and ``plopy.add_array``,then call ``plopy.start()``If you're already accustomed to matplotlib, or want to convert pre-existingprograms, you can import ``plopy.fig`` and ``plopy.ax`` to plot on, and call``plopy.start()`` when done. This method also works in combination with theprevious one.See `the docs &lt;https://plopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scripting.html&gt;`_ for more examples.</longdescription>
