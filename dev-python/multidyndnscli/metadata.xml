A small example might look like this:```common:  cache_dir: &quot;&lt;existing writable folder for caching data&gt;&quot;dns_providers:  - name: &quot;Netcup&quot;    type: &quot;Netcup&quot;    userid: &quot;&lt;netcup-userid&gt;&quot;    apikey: &quot;&lt;netcup-apikey&gt;&quot;    apipass: &quot;&lt;netcup-apipass&gt;&quot;router:  ipv4:    method: &quot;wan&quot;    wan_interface: &quot;&lt;put-wan-iface-here&gt;&quot;  ipv6:    enabled: true    method: &quot;wan&quot;    wan_interface: &quot;&lt;put-wan-iface-here&gt;&quot;domains:  - name: &quot;test.invalid&quot;    dns_provider: &quot;Netcup&quot;    delay: 300    hosts:      - name: &quot;openwrt.lan&quot;        fqdn: &quot;openwrt.home.test.invalid&quot;        public_ip_methods:          ipv4: &quot;router&quot;          ipv6: &quot;router&quot;      - name: &quot;server.lan&quot;        fqdn: &quot;server.home.test.invalid&quot;        public_ip_methods:          ipv4: &quot;router&quot;          ipv6: &quot;local_dns&quot;```Create a folder for caching data which is writable by the user who runs the script and specify its location in `cache_dir`.Configure your DNS provider. Note, that currently only Netcup is supported.In our example, the script is running directly on the router. The router's IP addresses are identified by getting the public addresses of the specified WAN interface. Below, one domain called `test.invalid` is configured which consists of two local hosts. The example uses the DNS provder called `Netcup` (see above) for configuring the domain.The `name` of each host has to be equal to the fully-qualified domain name used internally to talk the respective hosts. The `fqdn` is the public DNS name which should point to the IP addresses of that host or the router. In many cases, there is only one public IPv4 address for the router and all internal hosts use private IPv4 addresses. In such a case, using `ipv4: &quot;router&quot;` in `public_ip_methods` will use the router's IPv4 address for the public FQDN. For IPv6, usually each host as well as the router will have public IPv6 addresses. Using `ipv6: &quot;local_dns&quot;` will make sure that the local DNS server is queried for each host's name and the first public IPv6 found is used for reconfiguring the public DNS.For every configured domain, all records to be updated will be identified and the whole domain will be changed using only one query to the DNS providers API. In the example, a `delay` of 300 seconds has been configured. If the last update for the domain has been done less tehn `delay` seconds ago, the current update will be skipped. This is particularly useful for DNSSEC-enabled domains, where the domain has to be resigned after any updates. Resigning may take quite a while and no further updates should be done until the updated values have become visible.You can find a complete example configuration file [here](config.example.yaml).For further information, have a look at the documentation: https://ethaden.github.io/multidyndnscli/.### Running multidyndnscliThis project generates a command line script `multidyndnscli` in either your virtual env's `bin` folder, in the well-known locations in the user's home directory (e.g. ``$HOME/.local/bin``) or in a system-wide bin folder (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`).Make sure the respective path is in your `$PATH`.Once the Python package is installed, run it by executing ```bashmultidyndnscli &lt;your-config-file&gt;```Use a cronjob or systemd to run the tool periodically.It is highly recommended not to run the tool with root privileges.## Development### Using a dev containerIf using Visual Studio Code, you'll can make use of a working dev container setup specified in `.devcontainer` which should be found automatically. Make sure to adapt the WAN interface used for testing - if any - to the one configure within the running container.### Local development `pyenv`This project can use `pyenv`, though using it is not mandatory. You can install `pyenv` by following the instructions on the pyenv website https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.List installable versions```pyenv install -l```Initialize the required/desired python environments:```pyenv install 3.8pyenv install 3.9pyenv install 3.10pyenv install 3.11```Show installed version:```pyenv versions```#### Installing `poetry`This project use based on `poetry`. You can install `poetry` by following the instructions on the poetry website https://python-poetry.org/.#### Install all packages with poetryFor development including tools for generating documentation, use:```poetry install```For installing only the packages required to run the tool, use:```poetry install --without dev```#### Installing pre-commitRun the following to enable python pre-commit:```poetry run pre-commit install```You can run the pre-commit scripts manually:```poetry run pre-commit run --all-files```### Running the development toolsThere are basically three ways to run tools. You can use `tox`, run the commands directly on the command line or - if using Visual Studio Code - use some VS code preconfigured tasks.#### Running testsYou can use `tox`:```tox```Alternatively, you can run `pytest` manually:```poetry run pytest --cov-report xml:cov.xml --cov-report term-missing --cov=multidyndnscli tests/```#### Running code formatter```poetry run black --skip-string-normalization .```Alternatively, run formatter with tox:```tox -e format```#### Run linter```poetry run pylint multidyndnscli```Alternatively, run linter with tox:```tox -e linter```#### Running code analysis with mypy```poetry run mypy multidyndnscli```### Build the docsBuild the docs in folder `docs`:```poetry run sphinx-build -b html docs/source/  docs/build/html```### Increase the versionUpdate the version in `pyproject.tom`. The tool will report this version after the release.# ContributorsSee [Contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md)# LicenseCopyright Eike Thaden, 2023.Distributed under the terms of the GPL v3 license, multidyndnscli is free and open source software.</longdescription>
