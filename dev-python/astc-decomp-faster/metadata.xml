	<longdescription>**bconstanzo:** this is a fork of K0lb3's work focused on improving performance by adding some Cython magic (types, which took a bit of effort to get right). Since it completely removes python from the hot loop (and almost all of the decompression function) it achieves some nice speedups (6-8 times faster). Any bottlenecks would then be inside the C++ functions, or your compilers ability to optimize said code.The main reason I'm making this fork is that iLEAPP had the astc_decomp module as a bottleneck at the time of release, and I worked a couple of weeks into improving it. There may be better alternatives for ASTC decompression out there.**K0lb3's original readme follows:**# ASTC_DecompAn ASTC decoder for PIL.The decoder uses [richgel999/astc_dec](https://github.com/richgel999/astc_dec) to decompress the ASTC blocks.## Installation- Cython required### PIP```pip install astc_decomp```### Manual```cmdpython setup.py install```## Usage### Arguments* block_width: - Block width, in pixels.* block_height: - Block height, in pixels.* is_srgb: - If isSRGB is true, the spec requires the decoder to scale the LDR 8-bit endpoints to 16-bit before interpolation slightly differently, which will lead to different outputs. So be sure to set it correctly (ideally it should match whatever the encoder did).(optional arg, default : False)### PIL.Image decoder```pythonfrom PIL import Imageimport astc_decomp #needs to be imported once in the active code, so that the codec can register itselfastc_data : bytesblock_width : intblock_height : intis_srgb : bool = Falseimg = Image.frombytes('RGBA', size, astc_data, 'astc', (block_width, block_height, is_srgb))```### raw decoder```pythonfrom astc_decomp import decompress_astc# ASTC to RGBArgba_data = decompress_astc(astc_data : bytes, width : int, height : int, block_width : int, block_height : int, is_srgb : bool = False)```</longdescription>
