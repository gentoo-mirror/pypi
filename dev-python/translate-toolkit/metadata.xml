TheToolkit is part of the Translate project, hosted at&lt;https://github.com/translate&gt;.The software includes programs to convert localization formats to the commonPO, and emerging XLIFF format.  There are also programs to check and manage POand XLIFF files.  Online documentation includes guides on using the tools,running a localization project and how to localize various projects fromOpenOffice.org to Mozilla.At its core the software contains a set of classes for handling variouslocalization storage formats: DTD, properties, OpenOffice.org GSI/SDF,CSV, MO, Qt .ts, TMX, TBX, WordFast txt, Gettext .mo, Windows RC, andof course PO and XLIFF.  It also provides scripts to convert betweenthese formats.Also part of the Toolkit are Python programs to create word counts, mergetranslations and perform various checks on translation files.Important Links---------------* `Latest release downloads &lt;https://github.com/translate/translate/releases&gt;`_* `Documentation  &lt;http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/translate-toolkit/en/latest/&gt;`_,  also use ``--help`` with any of the commands.* The Translate Toolkit is released under the `GPL  &lt;https://github.com/translate/translate/blob/master/COPYING&gt;`_ with  `contributions from many people  &lt;https://github.com/translate/translate/blob/master/CREDITS&gt;`_.* `Reporting issues &lt;https://github.com/translate/translate/issues&gt;`_* `Installation &lt;http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/translate-toolkit/en/stable/installation.html&gt;`_Joining the Translate Project-----------------------------If you would like to join the translate project mailing list then visit:&lt;http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/translate-devel&gt;.The vision of the Translate Project is to be a meta project for localizersbuilt on the premise that your language deserves to be a project on its ownright not a poor cousin of the main project.Most projects are inattentive to the needs and difficulties experienced bylocalizers. To that end the aim is to work towards creating tools anddocumentation that allows localizers to focus on what they do best: translatingsoftware.Requirements------------There are several extra requirements which you might to install to get fullfeature set. This cal be easily specified during pip installation::    # Install with XML support    pip install translate-toolkit[XML]    # Install all optional dependencies    pip install translate-toolkit[all].. note:: Please check ``requirements/*.txt``::       pip install -r requirements/optional.txt   Will install all optional dependencies convering support for many other   formats.The Toolkit requires Python 3.8 or newer.The package lxml is required. You should install version 4.6.3 or later.&lt;http://lxml.de/&gt; Depending on your platform, the easiest way to install mightbe through your system's package management. Alternatively you can try ::    pip install lxmlwhich should install the newest version from the web.For Mac OSX, the following pages might be of help:&lt;http://lxml.de/build.html#building-lxml-on-macos-x&gt;&lt;http://lxml.de/installation.html#macos-x&gt;The package lxml has dependencies on libxml2 and libxslt. Please check the lxmlsite for the recommended versions of these libraries if you need to installthem separately at all. Most packaged versions of lxml will already containthese dependencies.When the environment variable USECPO is set to 1, the toolkit will attempt touse libgettextpo from the gettext-tools package (it might have a slightlydifferent name on your distribution). This can greatly speed up access to POfiles, but has not yet been tested as extensively. Feedback is most welcome.The package iniparse is necessary for ini2po and po2ini:&lt;https://pypi.org/project/iniparse/&gt;The python-Levenshtein package will improve performance for fuzzy matching ifit is available. This can improve the performance of pot2po, for example.  Itis optional and no functionality is lost if it is not installed, only speed.&lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/translate/files/python-Levenshtein/&gt;Functions in the `lang.data` module can supply functions to translate languagenames using the `pycountry` package. It can even translate names in the format``Language (Country)`` such as ``English (South Africa)`` This is used byPootle and Virtaal. If the package is not installed, the language names willsimply appear in English. It is therefore recommended you install the`pycountry` package.The package vobject is needed for ical2po and po2ical.The aeidon package (or gaupol if aeidon is not available) is needed for sub2poand po2sub. Some Unicode encoded files (including most files from&lt;http://dotsub.com/&gt;) require version 0.14 or later.&lt;http://home.gna.org/gaupol/&gt;Gaupol might need the 'Universal Encoding Detector'&lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet&gt;Trados TXT TM support requires the BeautifulSoup parser&lt;http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/&gt;Markdown support requires the mistletoe parser&lt;https://github.com/miyuchina/mistletoe&gt;Program overview----------------Use ``--help`` to find the syntax and options for all programs.* Converters::        oo2po    - convert between OpenOffice.org GSI files and PO        oo2xliff - convert between OpenOffice.org GSI files and XLIFF        moz2po   - convert between Mozilla files and PO        csv2po   - convert PO format to CSV for editing in a spreadsheet program        php2po   - PHP localisable string arrays converter.        ts2po    - convert Qt Linguist (.ts) files to PO        txt2po   - convert simple text files to PO        html2po  - convert HTML to PO (beta)        md2po    - convert Markdown to PO        xliff2po - XLIFF (XML Localisation Interchange File Format) converter        prop2po  - convert Java .properties files to PO        po2wordfast - Wordfast Translation Memory converter        po2tmx   - TMX (Translation Memory Exchange) converter        pot2po   - PO file initialiser        csv2tbx  - Create TBX (TermBase eXchange) files from Comma Separated                   Value (CSV) files        ini2po   - convert .ini files to to PO        ical2po  - Convert iCalendar files (*.ics) to PO        sub2po   - Convert many subtitle files to PO        resx2po  - convert .Net Resource (.resx) files to PO* Tools (Quality Assurance)::        pofilter - run any of the 40+ checks on your PO files        pomerge  - merge corrected translations from pofilter back into                   your existing PO files.        poconflicts - identify conflicting use of terms        porestructure - restructures po files according to poconflict directives        pogrep   - find words in PO files* Tools (Other)::        pocompile - create a Gettext MO files from PO or XLIFF files        pocount   - count translatable file formats (PO, XLIFF)        podebug   - Create comment in your PO files' msgstr which can                    then be used to quickly track down mistranslations                    as the comments appear in the application.        posegment - Break a PO or XLIFF files into sentence segments,                    useful for creating a segmented translation memory.        poswap    - uses a translation of another language that you                    would rather use than English as source language        poterminology - analyse PO or POT files to build a list of                        frequently occurring words and phrases</longdescription>
