	<longdescription># Midgard, the Python Geodesy libraryMidgard is a collection of useful Python utilities used by the Geodeticinstitute at the Norwegian Mapping Authority (Kartverket). Although some ofthese are geodesy-specific, many are also useful in more general settings.**Note:** Midgard is still in pre-alpha status. Its functionality will change,  and it should not be depended on in any production-like setting.[![Latest version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/midgard.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/midgard/)[![Python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/midgard.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/midgard/)[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/ambv/black)## Installing MidgardMidgard is available at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/midgard/). You caninstall it by simply running    python -m pip install midgard## Installing Midgard from sourceMidgard depends on several other brilliant Python packages, like for instancenumpy, scipy, etc. We recommend using the Anaconda distribution to easethe installation of these dependencies.### Install AnacondaGo to [www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download), anddownload Anaconda for Python 3.### Download the Midgard source codeIf you have not already done so, download the Midgard source code from Github:[github.com/kartverket/midgard](https://github.com/kartverket/midgard). Thenenter the main `midgard` directory before running the install command below.    cd midgard### Install dependenciesYou should now install the necessary dependencies using the`environment.yml`-file. You can do this either in your current condaenvironment, or choose to create a new `midgard`-environment. In order to use`midgard` in other projects you need to install `midgard` in the sameenvironment as those projects.To install `midgard` in your current environment, do    conda env update -f environment.ymlTo install `midgard` in a new environment named `midgard` and activate it, do    conda env create -n midgard -f environment.yml    conda activate midgard### Install the Midgard packageTo do the actual installation of Midgard, use the `flit` packaging tool:    python -m flit install --dep productionIf you want to develop the Midgard package, install it in editable mode using    python -m flit install -sOn Windows, you can install in editable mode using    python -m flit install --pth-file## Using MidgardMidgard comes organized into different subpackages. To see info about thedifferent subpackages, use the Python help system:    &gt;&gt;&gt; import midgard    &gt;&gt;&gt; help(midgard)Information about individual subpackages is also available on the[Midgard website](https://kartverket.github.io/midgard/).</longdescription>
