	<longdescription>===========Added Value===========A Sphinx extension for embedding Python object *values* into documentation as text, listsor tables.This is achieved by adding new roles and directives which refer to Python objects which containthe values to be represented. The extension provides roles for embedded single and lists of values,and a sophisticated directive for rendering complex data structures like lists of dictionaries astables.Status======Build status:.. image:: https://github.com/sixty-north/added-value/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master     :target: https://github.com/sixty-north/added-value/actions?workflow=CI     :alt: CI Status.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/added-value/badge/?version=latest    :target: https://added-value.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest    :alt: Documentation StatusInstallation============The ``added-value`` package is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI):.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/added-value.svg    :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/added-valueThe package supports Python 3 only. To install::  $ pip install added-valueUsage=====*Added Value* provides a number of roles and directives for embedding Python values into yourdocumentation. For example, sing added value we can extract the value of *pi* from the PythonStandard Library ``math`` module, and embed it in a sentence, using the ``format`` role providedby *Added Values*, like this:::    The ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle is :format:`math.pi, .3f` to three    decimal places.Which gives:    The ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle is 3.142 to three    decimal places.Powerful tools--------------Added value is powerful, and allows lists, dictionaries, and even complex data structures such aslists of lists of dictionaries to be rendered into tables in various ways.
