	<longdescription>##########scikit-hts##########Hierarchical Time Series with a familiar API. This is the result from not having found any good implementationsof HTS on-line, and my work in the mobility space while working at Circ (acquired by Bird scooters).My work on this is purely out of passion, so contributions are alwayswelcomed. You can also buy me a coffee if you'd like:     ETH / BSC Address:  ``0xbF42b9c8F7B69D52b8b986AA4E0BAc6838Af6698``.. image:: https://github.com/carlomazzaferro/scikit-hts/workflows/main%20workflow/badge.svg?branch=master    :target: https://github.com/carlomazzaferro/scikit-hts/actions.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/scikit-hts.svg    :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/scikit-hts.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/racket/badge/?version=latest    :target: https://racket.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest    :alt: Documentation Status.. image:: https://codecov.io/gh/carlomazzaferro/scikit-hts/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=K4OAC8C51T    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/carlomazzaferro/scikit-hts    :alt: Coverage.. image:: https://pepy.tech/badge/scikit-hts/month     :target: https://pepy.tech/project/scikit-hts/month     :alt: Downloads/Month.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/join-us%20on%20slack-gray.svg?longCache=true&amp;logo=slack&amp;colorB=brightgreen    :target: https://join.slack.com/t/scikit-hts/shared_invite/zt-d5is54bp-iOeagm7Jv68ZTkjk_zezrA    :alt: Slack* `MIT License`_* Documentation: https://scikit-hts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.. _`MIT License`: https://github.com/carlomazzaferro/scikit-hts/blob/master/LICENSEOverview--------Building on the excellent work by Hyndman [1]_, we developed this package in order to provide a python implementationof general hierarchical time series modeling... [1] `Forecasting Principles and Practice. Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos. Monash University, Australia &lt;https://otexts.com/fpp2/&gt;`_... note:: **STATUS**: alpha. Active development, but breaking changes may come.Features--------* Supported and tested on ``python 3.6``, ``python 3.7`` and ``python 3.8``* Implementation of Bottom-Up, Top-Down, Middle-Out, Forecast Proportions, Average Historic Proportions,  Proportions of Historic Averages and OLS revision methods* Support for representations of hierarchical and grouped time series* Support for a variety of underlying forecasting models, inlcuding: SARIMAX, ARIMA, Prophet, Holt-Winters* Scikit-learn-like API* Geo events handling functionality for geospatial data, including visualisation capabilities* Static typing for a nice developer experience* Distributed training &amp; Dask integration: perform training and prediction in parallel or in a cluster with DaskExamples--------You can find code usages here: https://github.com/carlomazzaferro/scikit-hts-examplesRoadmap-------* More flexible underlying modeling support    * [P] AR, ARIMAX, VARMAX, etc    * [P] Bring-Your-Own-Model    * [P] Different parameters for each of the models* Decoupling reconciliation methods from forecast fitting    * [W] Enable to use the reconciliation methods with pre-fitted models| **P**: Planned| **W**: WIPCredits-------This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template... _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage=======History=======0.1.0 (2020-01-02)------------------* First release on PyPI.0.2.0 (2018-02-13)------------------* Major feature implementation and documentation* Static typing* Testing - 44% coverage0.2.3 (2020-03-28)------------------* Testing up to 75%* Exogenous variable support* Extensive docs0.3.0 (2020-03-28)------------------* Parallel and distributed training0.4.0 (2020-03-28)------------------* Testing for all reconciliation methods, line coverage &gt; 80%0.4.1 (2020-03-28)------------------* Python 3.6 support0.5.2 (2020-03-28)------------------* Added support for no revision, thanks @ryanvolpi* Added multiple example at https://github.com/carlomazzaferro/scikit-hts-examples, thanks @vtoliveira* Logging fixes and usability improvements0.5.3 (2021-02-23)------------------* Support for grouped time series, thanks to @noahsa!
