	<longdescription>SSFP====Simple steady-state free precession simulation.  The goal is toprovide a simple to use, pip-installable solution for simulating andworking with this wonderful pulse sequence.In this package:- bSSFP: `bssfp()`- FIMTRE: `fimtre()`- GRE: `gre()`- GS solution: `gs_recon()`- PLANET: `planet()`- 3D Region Growing Phase Correction: `rgphcorr3d()`- Robust Coil Combination: `robustcc()`Installation============Should be as easy as:.. code-block:: bash    python -m pip install ssfpUsage=====See `ssfp.examples` for typical usage.  You can run examples like:.. code-block:: bash    python -m ssfp.examples.basic_bssfpBalanced steady-state free precession can be called through `bssfp()`.This is an implementation of equations [1--2] in [1]_.  Theseequations are based on the Ernst-Anderson derivation [2]_ whereoff-resonance is assumed to be subtracted as opposed to added (as inthe Freeman-Hill derivation [3]_).  Hoff actually gets Mx and Myflipped in the paper, so we fix that here.  We also assume thatthe field map will be provided given the Freeman-Hill convention... code-block:: python    from ssfp import bssfp    # Here's the simplest usage, see docstring for all the possible    # function arguments    sig = bssfp(T1, T2, TR, alpha)We can also easily get the Geometric Solution to the ellipticalsignal model as described in [1]_ as follows:.. code-block:: python    from ssfp import gs_recon    recon = gs_recon(phased_cycled_images, pc_axis=-1)    # Notice that we can specify the axis where the phase-cycles livePLANET [4]_ is a method for simultaneous T1, T2 fitting for bSSFPphase-cycled data.  Call like this:.. code-block:: python    from ssfp import planet    # For a single pixel:    Meff, T1, T2, df = planet(        phased_cycled_pixels, alpha, TR, T1_guess,        pcs=np.deg2rad([0, 90, 180, 270, etc...]))3D Region Growing Phase Correction [5]_ is an algorithm fordetermining water and fat images from a single bSSFP acquisition.It can be called like this:.. code-block:: python    from ssfp import rgphcorr3d    phase_corrected = rgphcorr3d(        dataset3d, cellsize=(4, 4, 4), slice_axis=-1)    # see ssfp.examples.basic_rgphcorr for full usage exampleRobust Coil Combination for bSSFP Elliptical Signal Model [6]_ is acoil combination method that preserves the elliptical relationshipsbetween phase-cycled pixels.  It has two variants: simple and full.By default, the simple method is called.  The full method is veryslow and only used for validation of the simple method.Robust coil combination can be called like this:.. code-block:: python    from ssfp import robustcc    sx, sy, sz, num_pc, num_coils = data.shape[:]    coil_combined = robustcc(data, pc_axis=-2, coil_axis=-1)    # see ssfp.examples.basic_robustcc for more usage examplesChangelog=========- 1.2.0: setup.py -&gt; pyproject.toml; GPL -&gt; MIT licence; general maintenance;  dependency version bumps; type annotations; divide-by-zero fixes- 1.0.0: `bssfp()` function overhaul to allow arbitrarily dimensioned  input arrays or scalars and removes the `target_pc_axis` argument.References==========..
