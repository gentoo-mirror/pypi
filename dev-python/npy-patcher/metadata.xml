	<longdescription># npy-cpp-patchesRead N-Dimensional patches from `.npy` files. This module is built using `C++` and has `Python3` bindings.## Data Specifications- Arrays must be saved in `C-contiguous` format, i.e. **NOT** `Fortran-contiguous`.- First dimension is indexed using in a non-contiguous manner. For example, this can be used to extract specific channels within a natural image.- Next dimensions are specified by a patch shape `C++` vector or `Python` tuple. To extract patches of lower dimensionality than that of the data, set the corresponding dimensions to `1`.## Python Usage### Install```pip install npy-patcher```### Usage```pythonfrom npy_patcher import PatcherDouble, PatcherFloat, PatcherInt, PatcherLong# In this example lets say our data has shape (10, 90, 90), and is therefore 3D.data_fpath = '/my/numpy/file.npy'patcher = PatcherFloat() # Use PatcherFloat for np.float32 datatypenc_index = [0, 1, 3, 5, 7] # Non-contiguous indexpatch_shape = (30, 30) # Contiguous patch shape.patch_num = 2# The patch number indexes the patches (starting from 0). So in our example the index 2 would be equivalent to data[nc_index, 0:30, 60:90]. The variable indexes the patches in C-contiguous manner, i.e. the last dimension has the smallest stride.patch = patcher.get_patch(data_fpath, nc_index, patch_shape, patch_num)patch = patch.reshape((5, 30, 30)) # PatcherFloat returns a list, therefore we need to reshape.```## C++ UsageBelow is an example written in `C++`, equivalent to the `Python` usage above.```cpp// test.cpp#include &quot;src/patcher.hpp&quot;#include &lt;vector&gt;#include &lt;string&gt;int main() {    std::string fpath = &quot;data.npy&quot;;    std::vector&lt;size_t&gt; nc_index {0, 1, 3, 5, 7};    std::vector&lt;size_t&gt; patch_shape {30, 30};    size_t patch_num = 2;    Patcher&lt;float&gt; patcher;    // Here the patch object is a contiguous 1D vector    std::vector&lt;float&gt; patch = patcher.get_patch(fpath, nc_index, patch_shape, patch_num);    return 0;}```You can then build the package, for example using `g++`:```bash$ cd npy-cpp-patches/$ g++ -std=c++17 -I ./ -g test.cpp src/npy_header.cpp src/pyparse.cpp -o test```</longdescription>
