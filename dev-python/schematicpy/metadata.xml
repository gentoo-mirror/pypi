The Python based infrastructure provides a _novel_ schema-based, metadata ingress ecosystem, that is meant to streamline the process of biomedical dataset annotation, metadata validation and submission to a data repository for various data contributors.# Installation## Installation Requirements* Python version 3.9.0≤x&lt;3.11.0 Note: You need to be a registered and certified user on [`synapse.org`](https://www.synapse.org/), and also have the right permissions to download the Google credentials files from Synapse.## Installation guide for data curator appCreate and activate a virtual environment within which you can install the package:```python3 -m venv .venvsource .venv/bin/activate```Note: Python 3 has a built-in support for virtual environment [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv) so you no longer need to install virtualenv.Install and update the package using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):```python3 -m pip install schematicpy```If you run into error: Failed building wheel for numpy, the error might be able to resolve by upgrading pip. Please try to upgrade pip by:```pip3 install --upgrade pip```## Installation guide for developers/contributors When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.Please note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.### Development environment setup1. Clone the `schematic` package repository.```git clone https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic.git```2. Install `poetry` (version 1.2 or later) using either the [official installer](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) or [pipx](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx). If you have an older installation of Poetry, we recommend uninstalling it first. 3. Start the virtual environment by doing: ```poetry shell```4. Install the dependencies by doing: ```poetry install```This command will install the dependencies based on what we specify in poetry.lock. If this step is taking a long time, try to go back to step 2 and check your version of poetry. Alternatively, you could also try deleting the lock file and regenerate it by doing `poetry install` (Please note this method should be used as a last resort because this would force other developers to change their development environment)5. Fill in credential files: *Note*: If you won't interact with Synapse, please ignore this section.There are two main configuration files that need to be edited:[config.yml](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic/blob/develop/config.yml)and [synapseConfig](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sage-Bionetworks/synapsePythonClient/v2.3.0-rc/synapseclient/.synapseConfig)&lt;strong&gt;Configure .synapseConfig File&lt;/strong&gt;Download a copy of the ``.synapseConfig`` file, open the file in theeditor of your choice and edit the `username` and `authtoken` attribute under the `authentication` section *Note*: You could also visit [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#module-configparser&gt;) doc to see the format that `.synapseConfig` must have. For instance:&gt;[authentication]&lt;br&gt; username = ABC &lt;br&gt; authtoken = abc&lt;strong&gt;Configure config.yml File&lt;/strong&gt;*Note*: Below is only a brief explanation of some attributes in `config.yml`. &lt;strong&gt;Please use the link [here](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic/blob/develop/config.yml) to get the latest version of `config.yml` in `develop` branch&lt;/strong&gt;.Description of `config.yml` attributes    definitions:        synapse_config: &quot;~/path/to/.synapseConfig&quot;        service_acct_creds: &quot;~/path/to/service_account_creds.json&quot;    synapse:        master_fileview: &quot;syn23643253&quot; # fileview of project with datasets on Synapse        manifest_folder: &quot;~/path/to/manifest_folder/&quot; # manifests will be downloaded to this folder        manifest_basename: &quot;filename&quot; # base name of the manifest file in the project dataset, without extension        service_acct_creds: &quot;syn25171627&quot; # synapse ID of service_account_creds.json file    manifest:        title: &quot;example&quot; # title of metadata manifest file        # to make all manifests enter only 'all manifests'        data_type:           - &quot;Biospecimen&quot;          - &quot;Patient&quot;    model:        input:            location: &quot;data/schema_org_schemas/example.jsonld&quot; # path to JSON-LD data model            file_type: &quot;local&quot; # only type &quot;local&quot; is supported currently    style: # configuration of google sheet        google_manifest:          req_bg_color:            red: 0.9215            green: 0.9725            blue: 0.9803          opt_bg_color:            red: 1.0            green: 1.0            blue: 0.9019          master_template_id: '1LYS5qE4nV9jzcYw5sXwCza25slDfRA1CIg3cs-hCdpU'          strict_validation: true*Note*: Paths can be specified relative to the `config.yml` file or as absolute paths.6. Login to Synapse by using the command lineOn the CLI in your virtual environment, run the following command: ```synapse login -u &lt;synapse username&gt; -p &lt;synapse password&gt; --rememberMe```Please make sure that you run the command before running `schematic init` below7. Obtain Google credential FilesTo obtain  ``schematic_service_account_creds.json``, please run: ```schematic init --config ~/path/to/config.yml```&gt; As v22.12.1 version of schematic, using `token` mode of authentication (in other words, using `token.pickle` and `credentials.json`) is no longer supported due to Google's decision to move away from using OAuth out-of-band (OOB) flow. Click [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/resources/oob-migration) to learn more. *Notes*: Use the ``schematic_service_account_creds.json`` file for the serviceaccount mode of authentication (*for Google services/APIs*). Service accounts are special Google accounts that can be used by applications to access Google APIs programmatically via OAuth2.0, with the advantage being that they do not require human authorization. *Background*: schematic uses Google’s API to generate google sheet templates that users fill in to provide (meta)data.Most Google sheet functionality could be authenticated with service account. However, more complex Google sheet functionalityrequires token-based authentication. As browser support that requires the token-based authentication diminishes, we are hoping to deprecatetoken-based authentication and keep only service account authentication in the future. ### Development process instructionFor new features, bugs, enhancements1. Pull the latest code from [develop branch in the upstream repo](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic)2. Checkout a new branch develop-&lt;feature/fix-name&gt; from the develop branch3. Do development on branch develop-&lt;feature/fix-name&gt;   a. may need to ensure that schematic poetry toml and lock files are compatible with your local environment4. Add changed files for tracking and commit changes using [best practices](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/git-best-practices-git-commit)5. Have granular commits: not “too many” file changes, and not hundreds of code lines of changes6. Commits with work in progress are encouraged:   a. add WIP to the beginning of the commit message for “Work In Progress” commits7. Keep commit messages descriptive but less than a page long, see best practices8. Push code to develop-&lt;feature/fix-name&gt; in upstream repo9. Branch out off develop-&lt;feature/fix-name&gt; if needed to work on multiple features associated with the same code base10. After feature work is complete and before creating a PR to the develop branch in upstream    a. ensure that code runs locally    b. test for logical correctness locally    c. wait for git workflow to complete (e.g. tests are run) on github11. Create a PR from develop-&lt;feature/fix-name&gt; into the develop branch of the upstream repo12. Request a code review on the PR13. Once code is approved merge in the develop branch14. Delete the develop-&lt;feature/fix-name&gt; branch*Note*: Make sure you have the latest version of the `develop` branch on your local machine.## Installation Guide - Docker 1. Install docker from https://www.docker.com/ . &lt;br&gt;2.  Identify docker image of interest from [Schematic DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sagebionetworks/schematic/tags) &lt;br&gt;    Ex `docker pull sagebionetworks/schematic:latest` from the CLI or, run `docker compose up` after cloning the schematic github repo &lt;br&gt;    in this case, `sagebionetworks/schematic:latest` is the name of the image chosen3. Run Schematic Command with `docker run &lt;flags&gt; &lt;schematic command and args&gt;`. &lt;br&gt;&lt;t&gt; - For more information on flags for `docker run` and what they do, visit the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) &lt;br&gt;&lt;t&gt; - These example commands assume that you have navigated to the directory you want to run schematic from. To specify your working directory, use `$(pwd)` on MacOS/Linux or `%cd%` on Windows.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;t&gt; - If not using the latest image, then the full name should be specified: ie `sagebionetworks/schematic:commit-e611e4a` &lt;br&gt;&lt;t&gt; - If using local image created by `docker compose up`, then the docker image name should be changed: i.e. `schematic_schematic` &lt;br&gt;&lt;t&gt; - Using the `--name` flag sets the name of the container running locally on your machine &lt;br&gt;### Example For REST API &lt;br&gt;#### Use file path of `config.yml` to run API endpoints: ```docker run --rm -p 3001:3001 \  -v $(pwd):/schematic -w /schematic --name schematic \  -e SCHEMATIC_CONFIG=/schematic/config.yml \  -e GE_HOME=/usr/src/app/great_expectations/ \  sagebionetworks/schematic \  python /usr/src/app/run_api.py``` #### Use content of `config.yml` and `schematic_service_account_creds.json`as an environment variable to run API endpoints: 1. save content of `config.yml` as to environment variable `SCHEMATIC_CONFIG_CONTENT` by doing: `export SCHEMATIC_CONFIG_CONTENT=$(cat /path/to/config.yml)`2. Similarly, save the content of `schematic_service_account_creds.json` as `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDS` by doing: `export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDS=$(cat /path/to/schematic_service_account_creds.json)`3. Pass `SCHEMATIC_CONFIG_CONTENT` and `schematic_service_account_creds` as environment variables by using `docker run````docker run --rm -p 3001:3001 \  -v $(pwd):/schematic -w /schematic --name schematic \  -e GE_HOME=/usr/src/app/great_expectations/ \  -e SCHEMATIC_CONFIG_CONTENT=$SCHEMATIC_CONFIG_CONTENT \  -e SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDS=$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDS \  sagebionetworks/schematic \  python /usr/src/app/run_api.py``` ### Example For Schematic on mac/linux &lt;br&gt;To run example below, first clone schematic into your home directory  `git clone https://github.com/sage-bionetworks/schematic ~/schematic` &lt;br&gt;Then update .synapseConfig with your credentials```docker run \  -v ~/schematic:/schematic \  -w /schematic \  -e SCHEMATIC_CONFIG=/schematic/config.yml \  -e GE_HOME=/usr/src/app/great_expectations/ \  sagebionetworks/schematic schematic model \  -c /schematic/config.yml validate \  -mp /schematic/tests/data/mock_manifests/Valid_Test_Manifest.csv \  -dt MockComponent \  -js /schematic/tests/data/example.model.jsonld``` ### Example For Schematic on Windows &lt;br&gt;```docker run -v %cd%:/schematic \  -w /schematic \  -e GE_HOME=/usr/src/app/great_expectations/ \  sagebionetworks/schematic \  schematic model \  -c config.yml validate -mp tests/data/mock_manifests/inValid_Test_Manifest.csv -dt MockComponent -js /schematic/data/example.model.jsonld```# Other Contribution Guidelines## Updating readthedocs documentation1. `cd docs`2. After making relevant changes, you could run the `make html` command to re-generate the `build` folder.3. Please contact the dev team to publish your updates*Other helpful resources*:1. [Getting started with Sphinx](https://haha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html)2. [Installing Sphinx](https://haha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html)## Update toml file and lock fileIf you install external libraries by using `poetry add &lt;name of library&gt;`, please make sure that you include `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` file in your commit.## Reporting bugs or feature requestsYou can use the [`Issues`](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic/issues) tab to **create bug and feature requests**. Providing enough details to the developers to verify and troubleshoot your issue is paramount:- **Provide a clear and descriptive title as well as a concise summary** of the issue to identify the problem.- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.- **Explain which behavior you expected to see** instead and why.- **Provide screenshots of the expected or actual behaviour** where applicable.# Command Line UsagePlease visit more documentation [here](https://sage-schematic.readthedocs.io/en/develop/cli_reference.html)# Testing All code added to the client must have tests. The Python client uses pytest to run tests. The test code is located in the [tests](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic/tree/develop-docs-update/tests) subdirectory.You can run the test suite in the following way:```pytest -vs tests/```## Updating Synapse test resources1. Duplicate the entity being updated (or folder if applicable).2. Edit the duplicates (_e.g._ annotations, contents, name).3. Update the test suite in your branch to use these duplicates, including the expected values in the test assertions.4. Open a PR as per the usual process (see above).5. Once the PR is merged, leave the original copies on Synapse to maintain support for feature branches that were forked from `develop` before your update.   - If the old copies are problematic and need to be removed immediately (_e.g._ contain sensitive data), proceed with the deletion and alert the other contributors that they need to merge the latest `develop` branch into their feature branches for their tests to work.# Code style* Please consult the [Google Python style guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) prior to contributing code to this project.* Be consistent and follow existing code conventions and spirit.# ContributorsMain contributors and developers:- [Milen Nikolov](https://github.com/milen-sage)- [Mialy DeFelice](https://github.com/mialy-defelice)- [Sujay Patil](https://github.com/sujaypatil96)- [Bruno Grande](https://github.com/BrunoGrandePhD)- [Robert Allaway](https://github.com/allaway)- [Gianna Jordan](https://github.com/giajordan)- [Lingling Peng](https://github.com/linglp)</longdescription>
