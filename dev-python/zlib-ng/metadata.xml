There are some minor differencessee: differences-with-zlib-and-gzip-modules_... introduction endQuickstart----------.. quickstart startThe python-zlib-ng modules can be imported as follows.. code-block:: python    from zlib_ng import zlib_ng    from zlib_ng import gzip_ng``zlib_ng`` and ``gzip_ng`` are meant to be used as drop in replacements sotheir api and functions are the same as the stdlib's modules.A full API documentation can be found on `our readthedocs page&lt;https://python-zlib-ng.readthedocs.io&gt;`_.``python -m zlib_ng.gzip_ng`` implements a fully featured gzip-like command lineapplication (just like ``python -m gzip``, but better). Full usage documentation can befound on `our readthedocs page &lt;https://python-zlib-ng.readthedocs.io&gt;`_... quickstart endInstallation------------- with pip: ``pip install zlib-ng``- with conda: ``conda install python-zlib-ng``Installation is supported on Linux, Windows and MacOS. For more advancedinstallation options check the `documentation&lt;https://python-zlib-ng.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#installation&gt;`_.python-zlib-ng as a dependency in your project----------------------------------------------.. dependency startzlib-ng supports numerous platforms but not all of these have pre-built wheelsavailable. To prevent your users from running into issues when installingyour project please list a python-zlib-ng dependency as follows.``setup.cfg``::    install_requires =        zlib-ng; platform.machine == &quot;x86_64&quot; or platform.machine == &quot;AMD64&quot;``setup.py``::    extras_require={        &quot;:platform.machine == 'x86_64' or platform.machine == 'AMD64'&quot;: ['zlib-ng']    },.. dependency end.. _differences-with-zlib-and-gzip-modules:Differences with zlib and gzip modules--------------------------------------.. differences start+ Compression level 1 zlib_ng has a worse compression rate than that in  zlib. For other compression levels zlib_ng compresses better.+ ``gzip_ng.open`` returns a class ``GzipNGFile`` instead of ``GzipFile``. Since  there are differences between the compressed ratios between levels, a  difference in naming was chosen to reflect this.  ``gzip_ng.GzipFile`` does exist as an alias of  ``gzip_ng.GzipNGFile`` for compatibility reasons... differences endContributing------------.. contributing startPlease make a PR or issue if you feel anything can be improved. Bug reportsare also very welcome. Please report them on the `github issue tracker&lt;https://github.com/rhpvorderman/python-zlib-ng/issues&gt;`_... contributing endAcknowledgements----------------.. acknowledgements startThis project builds upon the software and experience of many.  Many thanks to:+ The `zlib-ng contributors  &lt;https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng/graphs/contributors&gt;`_ for making the  zlib-ng library.+ The `CPython contributors  &lt;https://github.com/python/cpython/graphs/contributors&gt;`_.  Python-zlib-ng mimicks ``zlibmodule.c`` and ``gzip.py`` from the standard  library to make it easier for python users to adopt it.+ The `github actions team &lt;https://github.com/orgs/actions/people&gt;`_ for  creating the actions CI service that enables building and testing on all  three major operating systems... acknowledgements end</longdescription>
