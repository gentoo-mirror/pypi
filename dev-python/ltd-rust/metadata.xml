	<longdescription>This is a rust implementation of the downsampling alogrithm Large-Triangle-Dynamic. The algorithm was described in the thesis &quot;Downsampling Time Series for Visual Representation&quot; written by Sveinn Steinarsson. You can find his thesis at https://skemman.is/handle/1946/15343f.The code is losely taken from https://github.com/janjakubnanista/downsample.This was a fun projet for me were I was able to implement the algorithm in rust and also publish it as a python package.## Usage```from ltd_rust import downsampleimport randomlength = 1000x = [i for i in range(length)]y = [random.randint(0,1000) for i in range(length)]x_down, y_down = downsample(x,y,100)```</longdescription>
