	<longdescription>Features-------- * Python 2 and 3 compatible * Automatic correction of   * Linefeeds according to patched file   * Diffs broken by stripping trailing whitespace   * a/ and b/ prefixes * Single file, which is a command line tool and a library * No dependencies outside Python stdlib * Patch format detection (SVN, HG, GIT) * Nice diffstat histogram * Linux / Windows / OS X * Test coverageThings that don't work out of the box: * File renaming, creation and removal * Directory tree operations * Version control specific properties * Non-unified diff formatsUsage-----Download **patch.py** and run it with Python. It is a self-containedmodule without external dependencies::    patch.py diff.patchYou can also run the .zip file::        python patch-1.16.zip diff.patchInstallation------------**patch.py** is self sufficient. You can copy it into your repositoryand use it from here. This setup will always be repeatable. But ifyou need to add `patch` module as a dependency, make sure to use strictspecifiers to avoid hitting an API break when version 2 is released::    pip install &quot;patch==1.*&quot;Changes-------        https://github.com/techtonik/python-patch/blob/master/doc/CHANGES.md</longdescription>
