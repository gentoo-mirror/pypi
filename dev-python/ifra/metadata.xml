It thus answers the problematic of data confidentiality. All federated learning algorithm followthose steps:  1. Choosing a model to train  2. Having each node training its own model  3. Aggregate the models into a single one and share it with the nodes  4. Nodes produce a new model taking the central model into account for their next learning phase. In addition, in IFRA  the node will also produce a new model if its data is uptdated.Steps 2 to 4 are an 'iteration' of the learning and are repeated until either the user stops the algorithm or somethreshold is reached. In IFRA, no thresholds exist, and the learning stops when the user(s) decide so.Differential privacy is automatically applied in each node by slightly changing the prediction of the rules(Only working for regression rule for now).IFRA consists of 3 independent and asynchronous actors, represented by the abstract class `ifra.actor.Actor`.Each can be run individually and monitors changes in its inputs. The three actors are :  * Nodes (**inputs**: data, central model, **output**: node model) (`ifra.node.Node`)  * Aggregator (**input**: node models, **output**: aggregated model) (`ifra.aggregator.Aggregator`)  * Central Server (**input**: aggregated model, **output**: central model) (`ifra.central_server.CentralServer`)This architecture is bug resilient, since if a node is down it can just be restarted without impacting the other actors.The difference between 'aggregated model' and 'central model' is that the central model will remember all the ruleslearned from all previous iterations, while the aggregated model only know the rules of the current iteration.In IFRA, nodes are anonymous : they all write their model to the same directory that is monitored by the aggregator, andthe aggregator does not have access to any information about the node. It does not know which node produced which model.In IFRA, one node produces one ruleskit.RuleSet object. Each user is free to define its own model byoverloading the `ifra.fitters.Fitter` class, as long as it produces a ruleskit.RuleSet object.The available models currently are:  * decisiontreeregression (see `ifra.fitters.DecisionTreeRegressionFitter` for details)  * decisiontreeclassification (see `ifra.fitters.DecisionTreeClassificationFitter` for details)The user also has the liberty to define its own aggregation method, by overloading `ifra.aggregation.Aggregation`.The available aggregation methods currently are:  * adaboost (see `ifra.aggregations.AdaBoostAggregation` for details)  * reverseadaboost (see `ifra.aggregations.ReverseAdaBoostAggregation` for details)  * keepall (see `ifra.aggregations.AggregateAll`)The user can implement the update method to be used by the node to take the central model into account by overloadingthe `ifra.node_model_updaters.NodeModelUpdater`. The available node updaters currently are:  * adaboost (adapted for adaboost, reverseadaboost and keepall aggregations)  (see `ifra.node_model_updaters.AdaBoostNodeModelUpdater`)Each node has the possbility to execute a dataprep before the first learning. The user has the liberty to define itsdataprep method by overloading the `ifra.datapreps.DataPrep` class. The available datapreps currently are:  * binfeatures (see `ifra.datapreps.BinFeaturesDataPrep`)To overload a class, read its documentation. Then, to make the actors use your class specify them in theactor's configuration file (`ifra.config.NodeLearningConfig` for *fitter*, *node updater* and *dataprep*) or in`ifra.config.AggregatorConfig` json file for *aggregation*).To be correctly imported, the line passed in the json for, let's say, the aggregation, must be like```json{   ...   &quot;aggregation&quot;: &quot;some.importable.AggregationClass&quot;   ...}```where *some.importable.AggregationClass* can be imported from the current working directory.To preserve data separation, each actor should be ran on a different machine. Models are shared across actors throughGoogle Cloud Storage, and it is the reponsability of the user to define buckets to store the models the the appropriateI/O rights for each actors.  * Each node should have read access the one unique bucket where the central model is to be written. In addition, each    node should have a read access its own data. No other actor should have read access to them. It should also have    write access to a place where the nodes models will be written. The place must be identical for each node of a    given learning.  * The aggregator should have read access to the place where nodes are expected to write their models, and write    access to a place dedicated for the aggregated model  * The central server should have read access to the aggregated model, and write access to the place where the central    model is read by the nodes.GCS paths are handeled by transparentpath.TransparentPath objects. For testing purposes, those paths can be local if noglobal filesystem is set by transparentpath.TransparentPath.To use IFRA, you need to do 5 things:  1. Define the nodes learning configurations in json files. It should be stored on GCS with read access by the node     only (set the appropriate access to the service accounts). See `ifra.configs.NodeLearningConfig` for more     information.  2. Define the nodes data configurations in json files. It should be reachable by the node only.     See `ifra.configs.NodeDataConfig` for more information.  3. Define the aggregator configuration in a json file. This file needs to be reachable by the aggregator only.     see `ifra.configs.AggregatorConfig` for more information.  4. Define the central server configuration in a json file. This file needs to be reachable by the central server only.     see `ifra.configs.CentralConfig` for more information.  5. On each node machine, instantiate the `ifra.node.Node` class by providing it with its learning and     data configuration, and call the `ifra.node.Node.run` method.  6. On the machine that should act as the aggregator, instantiate the `ifra.aggregator.Aggregator` class by     providing it with the list of all nodes configuration and its aggregator configuration, then call its     `ifra.aggregator.Aggregator.run` method.  7. On the machine that should act as the central server, instantiate the `ifra.central_server.CentralServer` class by     providing it with the its central configuration, then call its `ifra.central_server.CentralServer.run` method.Step 5, 6 and 7 can be done in any order.Example of step 1: you could create nodes learning configuration json files contaning:```json{    &quot;features_names&quot;: [&quot;sepal length in cm&quot;, &quot;sepal width in cm&quot;, &quot;petal length in cm&quot;, &quot;petal width in cm&quot;],    &quot;classes_names&quot;: [&quot;Iris-setosa&quot;, &quot;Iris-versicolor&quot;, &quot;Iris-virginica&quot;],  #
