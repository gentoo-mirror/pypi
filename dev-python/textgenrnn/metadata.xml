	<longdescription>Easily train your own text-generating neural network ofany size and complexity on any text dataset with a few linesof code, or quickly train on a text using a pretrained model.- A modern neural network architecture which utilizes new techniques asattention-weighting and skip-embedding to accelerate trainingand improve model quality.- Able to train on and generate text at either thecharacter-level or word-level.- Able to configure RNN size, the number of RNN layers,and whether to use bidirectional RNNs.- Able to train on any generic input text file, including large files.- Able to train models on a GPU and then use them with a CPU.- Able to utilize a powerful CuDNN implementation of RNNswhen trained on the GPU, which massively speeds up training time asopposed to normal LSTM implementations.- Able to train the model using contextual labels,allowing it to learn faster and produce better results in some cases.- Able to generate text interactively for customized stories.</longdescription>
