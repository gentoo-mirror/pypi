	<longdescription>.. inclusion-marker-1-5-do-not-removeThis package is typically used as a dependency for `uproot 3.x &lt;https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot3&gt;`__, to define methods on the classes that are automatically generated from ROOT files. This includes histograms (TH*) and physics objects like TLorentzVectors. The reason it's a separate library is so that we can add physics-specific functionality on a shorter timescale than we can update Uproot 3 itself, which is purely an I/O package.Occasionally, this library is used without Uproot 3, as a way to make arrays of TLorentzVectors.**Note:** this package is incompatible with ``awkward&gt;=1.0`` and ``uproot&gt;=4.0``! For Lorentz vectors, use `vector &lt;https://github.com/scikit-hep/vector&gt;`__. Since the versions of Awkward Array and Uproot that this is compatible with are deprecated, **this library is deprecated** as well... inclusion-marker-2-do-not-removeInstallation============Install uproot3-methods like any other Python package:.. code-block:: bash    pip install uproot3-methods               # maybe with sudo or --user, or in virtualenvDependencies:-------------- `numpy &lt;https://scipy.org/install.html&gt;`__ (1.13.1+)- `Awkward Array 0.x &lt;https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-0.x&gt;`__</longdescription>
