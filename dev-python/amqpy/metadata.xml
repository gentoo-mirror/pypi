Please submitissues and pull requests, and bugs will be fixed immediately.Guarantees----------This library makes the following guarantees:- `Semantic versioning`_ is strictly followed- Compatible with Python &gt;= 2.7.0 and PyPy- Compatible with Python &gt;= 3.2.0 and PyPy3 &gt;= 2.3.1 (Python 3.2.5)- AMQP 0.9.1 compliantFeatures========- Draining events from multiple channels: ``Connection.drain_events()``- SSL is fully supported, it is highly recommended to use SSL when connecting to  servers over the Internet.- Support for timeouts- Support for manual and automatic heartbeats- Fully thread-safe. Use one global connection and open one channel per thread.Supports RabbitMQ extensions:- Publisher confirms: enable with ``Channel.confirm_select()``, then use  ``Channel.basic_publish_confirm()``- Exchange to exchange bindings: ``Channel.exchange_bind()`` and  ``Channel.exchange_unbind()``- Consumer Cancel Notifications: by default a cancel results in ``ChannelError``  being raised, but not if a ``on_cancel`` callback is passed to  ``basic_consume``.. _Semantic versioning: http://semver.org.. |Version| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/tag/veegee/amqpy.svg.. |PyPI| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/amqpy.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/amqpy/    :alt: Latest Version</longdescription>
