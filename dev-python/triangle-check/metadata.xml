	<longdescription>## Triangle Check: scan iTunes backups for traces of compromise by Operation TriangulationThis script allows to scan iTunes backups for indicator of compromise by Operation Triangulation.For more information, please read [Securelist](https://securelist.com/trng-2023/)Contact: [triangulation@kaspersky.com](mailto:triangulation@kaspersky.com)## PrerequisitesThe script depends on: colorama (for pretty printing), pycryptodome## InstallationThe triangle_check utility can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/triangle-check/) (recommended):```python -m pip install triangle_check```The script can be run as-is (the subdirectory *triangle_check* is required):```python -m pip install -r requirements.txtpython triangle_check.py ```It can also be built into a pip package:```git clone https://github.com/KasperskyLab/triangle_checkcd triangle_checkpython -m buildpython -m pip install dist/triangle_check-1.0-py3-none-any.whl```For Windows or Linux, alternatively use the [binary builds](https://github.com/KasperskyLab/triangle_check/releases) of the triangle_check utility.  ## Usage```Usage: python -m triangle_check /path/to/iTunes_backup [backup_password]```### iTunes backup locationLocate the backup directory created by iTunes. The exact location depends on the OS and is described [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204215).The directory you are looking for should contain may subdirectories, and should include 'Manifest.db', 'Manifest.plist'. The backup may be encryptedwith a password, if set up in iTunes. That password is required to decrypt password-protected backups.### Advanced: create backup with libimobiledeviceYou can use the tool *idevicebackup2* that is a part of the open-source package named [libimobiledevice](https://libimobiledevice.org/). Popular Linux distributions, macports and homebrew allow to install it out of the box, and the package can be built from the source code for Linux or OSX. ### Scanning the backupRun the tool against the backup directory. If there are any traces of suspicious activity, the script will print out *SUSPICION* or *DETECTED* lines withmore information and detected IOCs, and that would mean that the device was *most likely* compromised.Example output:```==== IDENTIFIED TRACES OF COMPROMISE (Operation Triangulation) ====2022-*-* SUSPICION Suspicious combination of events:  * file modification: Library/SMS/Attachments/ab/11 * file attribute change: Library/SMS/Attachments/ab/11 * location service stopped: com.apple.locationd.bundle-/System/Library/LocationBundles/WRMLinkSelection.bundle * file modification: Library/Preferences/com.apple.ImageIO.plist * file attribute change: Library/Preferences/com.apple.ImageIO.plist * file birth: Library/Preferences/com.apple.ImageIO.plist * file modification: Library/Preferences/com.apple.locationd.StatusBarIconManager.plist * file attribute change: Library/Preferences/com.apple.locationd.StatusBarIconManager.plist * file birth: Library/Preferences/com.apple.locationd.StatusBarIconManager.plist2022-*-* DETECTED Exact match by NetUsage : BackupAgent2022-*-* DETECTED Exact match by NetTimestamp : BackupAgent```## What's next?The research on the Operation Triangulation is ongoing.
