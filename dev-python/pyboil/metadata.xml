The wheel will be built using the 'build' package, and it will be uploaded to Pypi via Twine.  Once you run build.sh, you will eventually be prompted for your Pypi username and password.  Pass this verification and your wheel will be uploaded.  After uploading the wheel, the script deletes all artifacts created locally.I hope to expand this with more options to include various other build files, such as the MANIFEST.in.  For now, a simple script to quick start projects is all that I needed.</longdescription>
