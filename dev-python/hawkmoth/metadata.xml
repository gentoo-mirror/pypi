It uses Clang Python Bindingsfor parsing, and generates C and C++ Domain directives for C and C++ APIdocumentation, and more. In short, Hawkmoth is Sphinx Autodoc for C/C++.Hawkmoth aims to be a compelling alternative for documenting C and C++ projectsusing Sphinx, mainly through its simplicity of design, implementation and use.**Note**   The C++ support is still in early stages of development, and lacks some   fundamental features such as handling namespaces and documenting C++ specific   features other than classes... _Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org.. _C and C++ Domain: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/domains.html.. _reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.htmlExample-------Given C source code with rather familiar looking documentation comments::  /**   * Get foo out of bar.   *   * :param bar: Name of the bar.   */  void foobar(const char *bar);and a directive in the Sphinx project::  .. c:autofunction:: foobar     :file: filename.cyou can incorporate code documentation into Sphinx. It's as simple as that.You can document functions, their parameters and return values, structs,classes, unions, their members, macros, function-like macros, enums, enumerationconstants, typedefs, variables, as well as have generic documentation commentsnot attached to any symbols.See the documentation `examples`_ section for more, with sample output... _examples: https://jnikula.github.io/hawkmoth/stable/examples.htmlDocumentation-------------Documentation on how to install, configure and use Hawkmoth, as well as writedocumentation comments, with examples, is available for both the `latestrelease`_ and the `version currently in development`_.The same is also hosted at `Read the Docs`_... _latest release: https://jnikula.github.io/hawkmoth/stable/.. _version currently in development: https://jnikula.github.io/hawkmoth/dev/.. _Read the Docs: https://hawkmoth.readthedocs.io/Installation------------You can install Hawkmoth from PyPI_ with::  pip install hawkmothYou'll additionally need to install Clang and Python 3 bindings for it throughyour distro's package manager; they are not available via PyPI. For furtherdetails, see the documentation.Alternatively, installation packages are available for:* `Arch Linux`_In Sphinx ``conf.py``, add ``hawkmoth`` to ``extensions``, and point``hawkmoth_root`` at the source tree.
