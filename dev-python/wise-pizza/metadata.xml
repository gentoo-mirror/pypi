For eachcombination of dimensions, the dataset must have a *total* value (total of the metric over that segment, for examplethe total volume in that region and currency), and an optional *size* value (set to 1 if not specified), this could forexample be the total number of customers for that region and currency. The *average* value of the outcome for the segmentis defined as total divided by size, in this example it would be the average volume per customer. `explain_levels` takes such a dataset and looks for a small number of 'simple' segments (each only constraining a small number of dimensions) that between them explain most of the variation in the averages; you could also think of them as the segments whose size-weighteddeviation from the overall dataset average is the largest. This trades off unusual averages (which will naturally occur more for smaller segments) against segment size.Yet another way of looking at it is that we look for segments which, if their average was reset to the overall datasetaverage, would move overall total the most.`explain_changes_in_totals` and `explain_changes_in_average` take two datasets of the kind described above, with the same column names, and apply the same kind of logic to find the segments that contribute most to the difference (in total or average, respectively) between the two datasets, optionally splitting that into contributions from changes in segment size and changes in segment total.Sometimes, rather than explaining the change in totals from one period to the next, one wishes to explain a change in averages. The analytics of this are a little different - for example, while (as long as all weights and totals are positive) increasing a segment size (other things remaining equal) always increases the overall total, it can increase or decrease the pverall average, depending on whether the average value of that segment is below or above the overall average.&lt;summary&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;- [What can this do for you?](#what-can-this-do-for-you)    - [Find interesting slices](#better-information-about-segments-and-subsegments-in-your-data)    - [Comparison between two datasets](#understanding-differences-in-two-time-periods-or-two-dataframes)- [Installation](#installation)- [Quick Start](#quick-start)- [For Developers](#for-developers) - [Tests](#testing) ## What can this do for you?The automated search for interesting segments can give you the following:### 1. Better information about segments and subsegments in your data By using **WisePizza** and defining initial segments, you can find a segment which maximizes a specific outcome, such as adoption rates.### 2. Understanding differences in two time periods or two dataframesIf you have two time periods or two datasets, you can find segments that experience the largest change in the totals from previous period/dataset.## InstallationYou can always get the newest *wise_pizza* release using ``pip``:https://pypi.org/project/wise-pizza/```pip install wise-pizza```From the command line (another way):```pip install git+https://github.com/transferwise/wise-pizza.git```From Jupyter notebook (another way):```!pip install git+https://github.com/transferwise/wise-pizza.git```Or you can clone and run from source, in which case you should `pip -r requirements.txt` before running.## Quick StartThe wisepizza package can be used for finding segments with unusual average:```Pythonsf = explain_levels(    df=data,    dims=dims,    total_name=totals,    size_name=size,    max_depth=2,    min_segments=20,    solver=&quot;lasso&quot;)```![plot](https://github.com/transferwise/wise-pizza/blob/main/docs/explain_levels.png?raw=True)Or for finding changes between two datasets in totals:```Pythonsf1 = explain_changes_in_totals(    df1=pre_data,    df2=data,    dims=dims,    total_name=totals,    size_name=size,    max_depth=2,    min_segments=20,    how=&quot;totals&quot;,    solver=&quot;lasso&quot;)```![plot](https://github.com/transferwise/wise-pizza/blob/main/docs/explain_changes_in_totals.png?raw=True)Or for finding changes between two datasets in average:```Pythonsf1 = explain_changes_in_average(    df1=pre_data,    df2=data,    dims=dims,    total_name=totals,    size_name=size,    max_depth=2,    min_segments=20,    how=&quot;totals&quot;,    solver=&quot;lasso&quot;)```![plot](https://github.com/transferwise/wise-pizza/blob/main/docs/explain_changes_in_average(totals).png?raw=True)And then you can visualize differences:```Pythonsf.plot()```And check segments:```Pythonsf.segments```Please see the full example [here](https://github.com/transferwise/wise-pizza/blob/main/notebooks/Finding%20interesting%20segments.ipynb)## For Developers### TestingWe use [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing. If you want to contribute code, make sure that the tests in tests/ run without errors.*Wise-pizza is open sourced and maintained by Wise Plc. Copyright 2023 Wise Plc.*</longdescription>
