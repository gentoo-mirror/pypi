	<longdescription># Py-Easy-Scrap## DescriptionA useful package for web scraping with Selenium## Installation```bashpip install py-easy-scrap```## Requirements- Python 3.7 or higher- Selenium, along with __GeckoDriver__ (Firefox)## UsageIn your project directory, create a new directory for your logs - it can be just called 'logs':```bashmkdir logs```Then, import the package:```pythonimport pyeasyscrap as pes```### Get WebDriver```pythondriver = pes.get_webdriver(headless)```This will return an instance of webdriver.Firefox (GeckoDriver).### Get Element```pythonelement = pes.get_element(driver, value=&quot;element_xpath&quot;)```This will return the web element found using the specified driver and value. By default, this function uses 'XPATH' as the method of searching. However, you can change this by providing 'ID' or 'LINK_TEXT' as the 'by' argument.Please be aware that the method of searching ('XPATH', 'ID', or 'LINK_TEXT') highly depends on the webpage structure. Therefore, it is essential to inspect the webpage beforehand.Also, please remember to replace `&quot;element_xpath&quot;` with the actual Xpath, ID, or link text of the element you want to find.### Scroll to Element```pythonpes.scroll_to(driver, element)```This will use JavaScript to scroll the view of the given webdriver to the specified web element.### Ask for Data```pythonrequired_data = (&quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)file_name_no_extension = &quot;user_credentials&quot;pes.ask_for_data(required_data, file_name_no_extension)```This will return a dictionary containing the collected data and will create a JSON configuration (.conf) file.### Check File```pythonpes.check_file(&quot;path_to_file&quot;)```This will return either True or False based on file existencePlease note that the above code snippets are basic examples of how to use those functions. Depending on the exact specifications of your use case, additional setup may be necessary (e.g. logging into a website before trying to scroll to an element).## ContributingPull requests are welcome.
