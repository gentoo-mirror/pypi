This library ships with a file that maps eachword to a syllable count in [pysyllables/syllable-counts.txt](pysyllables/syllable-counts.txt)## How does one generate [pysyllables/syllable-counts.txt](pysyllables/syllable-counts.txt)?[scripts/download_syllable_counts.sh](scripts/download_syllable_counts.sh) downloadsthe CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, computes each word's syllable count, and emits[pysyllables/syllable-counts.txt](pysyllables/syllable-counts.txt).Should there be a new version of the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, update the source in[scripts/download_syllable_counts.sh](scripts/download_syllable_counts.sh).## ContributingQuestions &amp; contributions welcome -- please open an issue or, even better, a PR!</longdescription>
