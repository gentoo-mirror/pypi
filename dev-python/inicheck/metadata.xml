See wiki for more info on thefile standards https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file .Objectives----------The goal of inicheck was to reduce endless logic gates and repeat code forsoftware that required complicated configuration files. We also wanted tocentralize options for an ever changing repo. We have a lot of experience withcodes that required config files that could easily have 1000 differentconfigurations. So from that need inicheck has been born.Basic Principles----------------inicheck requires a master config file to operate. The master config file isa gold standard files provided by the developer of a package. The master config(sometimes called the core config) provides the rules for every configurationfile that is passed to the software. There the developer can set types,constrain options, documentation strings and defaults. The developer can alsocreate recipes that can be triggered when a user has a specific combination ofconfig file entries.Once a master config file is created, all config files can be passed throughthe standards laid out in there. From there the software can provide feedbackto the user about why their file is being rejected. The master file also enablesthe user to have really simple config files that have larger meaning. Withrecipes and defaults, a user can provide relatively little and the developer canstill move forward without have a ridiculous amount of logic to handlescenarios.* Free software: GNU General Public License v3* Documentation: https://inicheck.readthedocs.io.Features--------* .ini file generating* Config file checking* Config file warning and error reporting* Command line interface* Apply defaults* Auto cast items into the correct types.* Constrain users by designated options* Create recipes to ensure the right settings are in place* Use custom types for your config file* Use multiple master config files for cleaner files* Auto config file documentation* Create changelogs to automatically manage deprecated config optionsCredits---------inicheck has been developed at the USDA-ARS-NWRC during efforts towards creatinghighly configurable, physically based watershed modeling software.inicheck originally was based on config parser and with time went away from it.We would not be here with that base and for that were grateful.This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template... _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage=======History=======0.1.0 (2018-01-05)------------------* First release on PyPI.0.2.0 (2018-04-11)------------------* Recipes were added in* Custom Checkers* Multiple master files can be used* Module associated files to find master configs* Detail finding in cli to get help on the fly0.3.0 (2018-08-10)------------------* Added the ability require an config entry be a list* Added significant unit tests0.4.0 (2019-07-19)------------------* Added in url datatype* Added Datetime Ordered data type for start stop options* Added in an inidiff script for comparing config files0.5.0 (2019-08-22)------------------* Fixed bug relating to Datetime Ordered Pairs* Added in inimake script for creating scripts from scratch* Added in more unittests (54% coverage)0.6.0 (2019-10-16)------------------* Built in a brand new feature for migrating large changes in configs* Added bounds checking for type checking allowing for continuous types* Fixes for issues: 25_ , 27_ , 31_ , 32_.. _25: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/inicheck/issues/25.. _27: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/inicheck/issues/27.. _31: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/inicheck/issues/31.. _32: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/inicheck/issues/320.7.0 (2019-10-22)------------------* Restructure the checkers some to better handle types* Fixed several broken tests.0.8.0 (05-29-2020)------------------* Increased unittest coverage from ~57% to ~83%)* Added in a CLI tool to find changelog impacts in python files* Switch from pandas to_datetime to dateparser to reduce package size* Added inicheck to traviCI and Coveralls* Fixes for 35_ , 38_ , 39_, 40_, 41_, 42_ 43_, 44_, 45_* Added in linting with isort and autopep8* Hardcoded `parse_date` to always use UTC and return timezone unaware object. 51_* Updated release to use setuptools_scm. 52_ .. _35: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/inicheck/issues/25.. _38: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/inicheck/issues/27.. _39: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/inicheck/issues/31.. _40: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/inicheck/issues/40.. _41: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/inicheck/issues/41.. _42: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/inicheck/pull/42.. _43: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/inicheck/issues/43.. _44: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/inicheck/issues/44.. _45: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/inicheck/issues/45.. _51: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/inicheck/issues/51.. _52: https://github.com/USDA-ARS-NWRC/inicheck/pull/52</longdescription>
