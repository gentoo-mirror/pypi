If you don't have a GPU, you can run EvoFlow onGoogle Colab or it will just work fine on your CPU.## Getting started in 30 seconds1. Install EvoFlow: `pip install evoflow`2. Head to our [hello world notebook](https://github.com/google-research/evoflow/blob/master/notebooks/onemax.ipynb) that will shows you how to use EvoFlow to solve the classic OneMax problem.## TutorialsThe following tutorials are availables| Problem                 | Description                                                 | Key concepts showcased                                                                                                                                             || ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ || OneMax                  | Maximize the number of ones in a chromosome                 | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;`EvoFlow` core API&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;`RandomMutation` OP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; `UniformCrossOver` Op&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evolution model construction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;`Results` basic usage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; || Travel Salesman problem | Visit each city once while minimizing the distance traveled | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Custom `Fitness function`&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genes permuting Ops: `Shuffle` and `Reverse`&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evolution model programatic construction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                  |Genetic Algorithm are used to solve a [wide variety of problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genetic_algorithm_applications)## Deep-learning versus Evoluationary algorithmsGenerally you want to use Deep-learning when the problem is continious/smoothand evoluationary algorithms when the problem is discrete. For example voicegeneration is smooth and solving (non-linear) equations is discrete.Concretely this means that the fitness functions you use to express what constraintto solve are very similar to the loss functions in deep-learning except theydon't need to be differentiable and therefore can perform arbitrary computation.However the cost of fitness function increased expressiveness and flexibilitycompared to neural network loss is that we don't have the gradients to helpguide the model convergence and therefore coverging is more computationalyexpensive which is why having a hardware accelerated framework is essential.## Genetic Algorithm terminology- **Gene**: atomic unit. Equivalent to a neuron in deep-learning.- **Chromosome**: ordered list of gene(s).- **Genotype**: collection of chromosome(s). Used when the problem requires tomaximizes multiples fitness function at once.- **Population of x**: collection of chromosomes or genotypes.  That is what makes a Tensor.- **Generation**: One round of evolution. Equivalent to an epoch in deep-learning.- **Fitness function**: Function that evaluate how good/fit a given chromosome is.  this is equivalent to the loss function in deep learning except it doesn'tneed to be differentiable and aim to be maximized.### EvoFlow Terminology- **Evoluation op**: Operation performed on a population of chromosome tomake them evolve. Common ops includes various type of Chromosomal crossoversand Chromosomal mutations. Equivalent to deep-learning layers(e.g a convolution layer).- **Evolution model**: Directed graph of evolutionary ops that is used  to evolve the population. This is equivalent to a model architecture  in deep-learning settings.## DisclaimerThis is not an official Google product.</longdescription>
