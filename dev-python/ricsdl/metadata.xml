	<longdescription>RIC SDL=======Shared Data Layer in the RAN Intelligent ControllerShared Data Layer (SDL) provides a lightweight, high-speed interface foraccessing shared data storage. The purpose is to enable utilizing clients tobecome stateless, conforming with, e.g., the requirements of the fifthgeneration mobile networks.Concepts--------NamespaceNamespaces provide data isolation within SDL data storage. That is, data incertain namespace is isolated from the data in other namespaces. Each SDLclient uses one or more namespaces. Namespaces can be used, for example, toisolate data belonging to different use cases.Keys and DataClients save key-data pairs. Data is passed as a `bytes` type. SDL stores thedata as it is. Any structure that this data may have (e.g. a data structureserialized by `pickle`) is meaningful only to the client itself. Clients areresponsible for managing the keys. As namespaces provide data isolation,keys in different namespaces always access different data.Backend Data StorageBackend data storage refers to data storage technology behind SDL API, whichhandles the actual data storing. SDL API hides the backend data storageimplementation from SDL API clients, and therefore backend data storagetechnology can be changed without affecting SDL API clients. Currently, Redisdatabase is used as a backend data storage solution.NotificationsNotifications functionality provide SDL clients the possibility to receivenotifications about data changes in SDL namespaces. SDL client receivingnotifications about data changes is referred to as &quot;subscriber&quot;, while the SDLclient modifying data and publishing notifications is referred to as&quot;publisher&quot;.Install-------Install from PyPi```python3 -m pip install ricsdl```Install using the source```python3 setup.py install```Usage-----Instructions how to use SDL can be found from O-RAN Software Community (SC)Documentation under Near Realtime RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) section:[O-RAN SC Documentation Home](https://docs.o-ran-sc.org/projects/o-ran-sc-ric-plt-sdl/en/latest/)Unit Testing------------To run the unit tests run the following command in the package directory:`python3 -m pytest`Examples--------See the ``examples`` directory.CI--The ci is done with the `tox` tool. See `tox.ini` file for details.</longdescription>
