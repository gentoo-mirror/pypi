It is one of a series of platforms that are being developed for the execution of QSD - a methodology for the research, design, and deployment of technologies and inform decision-making [2]_. It leverages the structure and modules developed in the `BioSTEAM &lt;https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteam&gt;`_ platform [3]_ with additional functions tailored to sanitation processes.As an open-source and impact-driven platform, QSDsan aims to identify configuration combinations, systematically probe interdependencies across technologies, and identify key sensitivities to contextual assumptions through the use of quantitative sustainable design methods (techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment and under uncertainty). All systems developed with ``QSDsan`` are included in the package `EXPOsan &lt;https://github.com/QSD-Group/EXPOsan&gt;`_ - exposition of sanitation and resource recovery systems.Additionally, another package, `DMsan &lt;https://github.com/QSD-Group/DMsan&gt;`_ (decision-making for sanitation and resource recovery systems), is being developed for decision-making among multiple dimensions of sustainability with consideration of location-specific contextual parameters.Installation------------The easiest way is through ``pip``, in command-line interface (e.g., Anaconda prompt, terminal):.. code::    pip install qsdsanIf you need to upgrade:.. code::    pip install -U qsdsanor for a specific version (replace X.X.X with the version number):.. code::    pip install qsdsan==X.X.XIf you want to install the latest GitHub version at the `main branch &lt;https://github.com/qsd-group/qsdsan&gt;`_ (note that you can still use the ``-U`` flag for upgrading):.. code::    pip install git+https://github.com/QSD-Group/QSDsan.git.. note::   If this doesn't give you the newest ``qsdsan``, try ``pip uninstall qsdsan`` first.   Also, you may need to update some ``qsdsan``'s dependency package (e.g., ' ``biosteam`` and ``thermosteam``) versions in order for the new ``qsdsan`` to run.or other fork and/or branch (replace ``&lt;USERNAME_OF_THE_FORK&gt;`` and ``&lt;BRANCH_NAME&gt;`` with the desired fork and branch names).. code::    pip install git+https://github.com/&lt;USERNAME_OF_THE_FORK&gt;/QSDsan.git@&lt;BRANCH_NAME&gt;You can also download the package from `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/qsdsan/&gt;`_.Note that development of this package is currently under initial stage with limited backward compatibility, please feel free to `submit an issue &lt;https://github.com/QSD-Group/QSDsan/issues&gt;`_ for any questions regarding package upgrading.If you are a developer and want to contribute to ``QSDsan``, please follow the steps in the `Contributing to QSDsan &lt;https://qsdsan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html&gt;`_ section of the documentation to clone the repository. If you find yourself struggle with the installation of QSDsan/setting up the environment, this extended version of `installation instructions &lt;https://qsdsan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/_installation.html&gt;`_ might be helpful to you.Documentation-------------You can find tutorials and documents at:   https://qsdsan.readthedocs.ioAll tutorials are written using Jupyter Notebook, you can run your own Jupyter environment, or you can click the ``launch binder`` badge on the top to launch the environment in your browser.For each of these tutorials, we are also recording videos where one of the QSD group members will go through the tutorial step-by-step. We are gradually releasing these videos on our `YouTube channel &lt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8fyVeo9xf10KeuZ_4vC_GA&gt;`_ so subscribe to receive updates!About the authors-----------------Development and maintenance of the package is supported by the Quantitative Sustainable Design Group led by members of the `Guest Group &lt;http://engineeringforsustainability.com/&gt;`_ at the `University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) &lt;https://illinois.edu/&gt;`_.
