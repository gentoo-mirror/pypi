It includes:- Basic `Python &quot;distribution&quot;/project`_ metadata- Command-line console script with sub-command boilerplate- A `Makefile`_ for local development build, test and maintenance tasks- `Docker`_ container images for users and development- Targets/recipes in the `Makefile`_ to automate releases- `Makefile`_ recipes/targets used for both local development and on CI/CD platforms- A `GitLab CI/CD`_ pipeline integrating those CI/CD recipes/targets- A `GitHub Actions`_ workflow/pipeline integrating those CI/CD recipes/targetsThe intended use is to add this repository as a VCS remote for your project.  Thusdevelopers can merge changes from this repository as we make changes related to Pythonproject structure and tooling.  As we add structure specific to certain types ofprojects (e.g. CLI scripts, web development, etc.), frameworks (e.g. Flask, Pyramid,Django, etc.), libraries and such, branches will be used for each such variation suchthat structure common to different variations can be merged back into the branches forthose specific variations... contents:: Table of Contents****************************************************************************************Template Usage****************************************************************************************This is a rough guide to applying this project template to your project.  This is notthoroughly tested as such tests would be so meta as to be extremely wasteful ofdeveloper time to create and maintain.  So report any issues you have or better yetfigure it out and submit a PR with corrections to this section.#. Choose the right branch to use:   Is your project a CLI utility?  A web application?  Which project hosting provider   and/or CI/CD platform will you use?  Choose the appropriate branch for your project:   - ``dist``:     Basic Python distribution with build, tests, linters, code formatting and release     publishing from local developer checkouts.   - ``cli``:     The above plus support for project's that provide an executable CLI.   - ``docker``:     The ``dist`` branch plus Docker containers for both development and     end-users/deployments.   - ``ci``:     The above plus GitLab CI/CD pipelines that run tests and linters as CI and     publish releases from ``develop`` and ``main`` as CD.   - ``ci-cli``:     The above plus the ``cli`` branch.   - etc.   Do not use the ``develop`` or ``main`` branches in your project as those branches   are used to test the CI/CD automatic releases process and as such contain bumped   versions, release notes, and other release artifacts that shouldn't be merged into   real projects.#. Reconcile VCS history:   If starting a fresh project::     $ git clone --origin &quot;template&quot; --branch &quot;ci-cli&quot; \     &quot;https://gitlab.com/rpatterson/python-project-structure.git&quot; &quot;./foo-project&quot;     $ cd &quot;./foo-project&quot;     $ git config remote.template.tagOpt --no-tags     $ git remote add &quot;origin&quot; &quot;git@gitlab.com:foo-username/foo-project.git&quot;     $ git config remote.template.tagOpt --no-tags     $ git switch -C &quot;main&quot; --track &quot;origin/main&quot;   If merging into an existing project::     $ git remote add &quot;template&quot; \     &quot;https://gitlab.com/rpatterson/python-project-structure.git&quot;     $ git config remote.template.tagOpt --no-tags     $ git merge --allow-unrelated-histories &quot;template/ci-cli&quot;#. Rename file and directory paths derived from the project name::     $ git ls-files | grep -iE 'python.?project.?structure'#. Rename strings derived from the project name and template author identity in project   files::     $ git grep -iE 'python.?project.?structure|ross|Patterson'#. Examine ``# TEMPLATE:`` comments and change as appropriate:   These are the bits that need the developer's attention and reasoning to take the   correct action.  So read the comments and address them with care and attention::     $ git grep &quot;TEMPLATE&quot;Finally, remove this section from this ``./README.rst`` and update the rest of it'scontent as appropriate for your project.  As fixes and features are added to theupstream template, you can merge them into your project and repeat steps 3-5 above asneeded.This template publishes pre-releases on all pushes to the ``develop`` branch and finalreleases on all pushes to the ``main`` branch.  Project owners may decide which typesof changes should go through pre-release before final release and which types of changesshould go straight to final release.  For example they may decide that:- Contributions from those who are not maintainers or owners should be merged into  ``develop``.  See `the ./CONTRIBUTING.rst file`_ for such an example public  contributions policy and workflow.- Fixes for bugs in final releases may be committed to a branch off of ``main`` and,  after passing all tests and checks, merged back into ``main`` to publish final  releases immediately.- Routine version upgrades for security updates may also be merged to ``main`` as  above for bug fixes.****************************************************************************************Installation****************************************************************************************Install and use either via a local, native installation or a Docker container image:Local/Native Installation========================================================================================Install using any tool for installing standard Python 3 distributions such as `pip`_::  $ pip3 install --user python-project-structureOptional shell tab completion is available via `argcomplete`_.Docker Container Image Installation========================================================================================The recommended way to use the Docker container image is via `Docker Compose`_.  See`the example ./docker-compose.yml file`_ for an example configuration.  Once you haveyour configuration, you can create and run the container::  $ docker compose upAlternatively, you make use the image directly.  Pull `the Docker image`_::  $ docker pull &quot;registry.gitlab.org/rpatterson/python-project-structure&quot;And then use the image to create and run a container::  $ docker run --rm -it &quot;registry.gitlab.org/rpatterson/python-project-structure&quot; ...The Docker images support the following platforms or architectures:- ``linux/amd64``- ``linux/arm64``- ``linux/arm/v7``Images are tagged with the branch name so images tagged with ``main`` are final releasesand images tagged with ``develop`` are pre-releases.Optional shell tab completion is available via `argcomplete`_.****************************************************************************************Usage****************************************************************************************See the command-line help for details on options and arguments::  $ python-project-structure --help  usage: python-project-structure [-h]  Python project structure foundation or template, top-level package.  optional arguments:    -h, --help  show this help message and exitIf using the Docker container image, the container can be run from the command-line aswell::  $ docker compose run &quot;python-project-structure&quot; python-project-structure --help  usage: python-project-structure [-h]  Python project structure foundation or template, top-level package.  optional arguments:    -h, --help  show this help message and exit****************************************************************************************Contributing****************************************************************************************NOTE: `This project is hosted on GitLab`_.  There's `a mirror on GitHub`_ but please useGitLab for reporting issues, submitting PRs/MRs and any other development or maintenanceactivity.See `the ./CONTRIBUTING.rst file`_ for more details on how to get started withdevelopment.****************************************************************************************Motivation****************************************************************************************There are many other Python project templates so why make another? I've been doingPython development since 1998, so I've had plenty of time to develop plenty of opinionsof my own.What I want in a template is complete tooling (e.g. test coverage, linting, formatting,CI/CD, etc.) but minimal dependencies, structure, and opinion beyond complete tooling(e.g. some non-Python build/task system, structure for frameworks/libraries notnecessarily being used, etc.).  I couldn't find a template that manages that balance sohere we are.I also find it hard to discern from other templates why they made what choices the did.As such, I also use this template as a way to try out various different options in thePython development world and evaluate them for myself.  You can learn about my findingsand the reasons the choices I've made in the commit history.Most importantly, however, I've never found a satisfactory approach to keeping projectstructure up to date over time.  So the primary motivation is to use this repository asa remote from which we can merge structure updates over the life of projects using thetemplate... _Python: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html.. _Python &quot;distribution&quot;/project: https://docs.python.org/3/distributing/index.html.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/.. _argcomplete: https://kislyuk.github.io/argcomplete/#installation.. _`This project is hosted on GitLab`:   https://gitlab.com/rpatterson/python-project-structure.. _`a mirror on GitHub`:   https://github.com/rpatterson/python-project-structure.. _`Docker`: https://docs.docker.com/.. _`Docker Compose`: https://docs.docker.com/compose/.. _the Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/merpatterson/python-project-structure.. _`GitLab CI/CD`: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/.. _`GitHub Actions`: https://docs.github.com/en/actions.. _Makefile:   https://gitlab.com/rpatterson/python-project-structure/blob/main/Makefile.. _`the example ./docker-compose.yml file`:   https://gitlab.com/rpatterson/python-project-structure/blob/main/docker-compose.yml.. _`the ./CONTRIBUTING.rst file`:   https://gitlab.com/rpatterson/python-project-structure/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst</longdescription>
