	<longdescription>(Idea and first version from Stan Vitkovsky. Forked fromhttps://code.google.com/p/upodder/)Simple podcast downloader=========================A simple command-line podcast downloader. Can be run from cron. Simplyadd your RSS feeds in ``~/.upodder/subscriptions`` and watch your latestpodcasts come in. Destination dir, filename, folder structures, etc canall be customized.Please report any bugs on`Github &lt;https://github.com/manuelRiel/upodder&gt;`__. I will promptly fixthem.Installation------------``pip install upodder``Usage-----After installation, run ``upodder``. It will initialize ``~/.upodder/``to keep your subscriptions and a small DB of seen files. After thatsimply enter you feeds in ``~/.upodder/subscriptions``.The next time you run ``upodder``, it will go over each feed anddownload new entries to ``~/Downloads/podcasts``.To view available options, run ``upodder --help``History and motivation----------------------I've been using this script for several years and the project seemsabandoned on Google Code. To keep it from disappearing, after GoogleCode is shut down, I've forked it here and refactored most parts. Toquote the original author, Stan Vitkovsky and his motivation:&quot;I needed a simple console podcast downloader.I did not find any one suitable for my needs (podracer lacked ATOMsupport, hpodder segfaulted from time to time and didn't understand ATOMas well. Both of then were unaware for entries IDs, only for mp3 filenames, which are subjects to be changed, as on rpod.ru).My usage scenario is to download unseen enclosures, place them in thefolder with a name ~/podcasts/%d-%m-%Y/{somename}.mp3 (like podracerdoes) and then rsync them to my MP3 player.Also, I wrote a bash script, which mounts my player with pmount-hal,calls podracer, rsyncs my player and unmounts it safely.&quot;Further Contributors---------------------  *akira (gaspar0069)*: Add support for multiple file extensions and   fix file move bug.</longdescription>
