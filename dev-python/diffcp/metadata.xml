	<longdescription>[![Build Status](http://github.com/cvxgrp/diffcp/workflows/build/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/cvxgrp/diffcp/actions/workflows/build.yml)# diffcp`diffcp` is a Python package for computing the derivative of a convex cone program, with respect to its problem data. The derivative is implemented as an abstract linear map, with methods for its forward application and its adjoint. The implementation is based on the calculations in our paper [Differentiating through a cone program](http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/diff_cone_prog.html).### Installation`diffcp` is available on PyPI, as a source distribution. Install it with```bashpip install diffcp```You will need a C++11-capable compiler to build `diffcp`.`diffcp` requires:* [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) &gt;= 1.15* [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy) &gt;= 1.10* [SCS](https://github.com/bodono/scs-python) &gt;= 2.0.2* [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/tree/stable) &gt;= 2.4* [threadpoolctl](https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl) &gt;= 1.1* [ECOS](https://github.com/embotech/ecos-python) &gt;= 2.0.10* Python &gt;= 3.7`diffcp` uses Eigen; Eigen operations can be automatically vectorized by compilers. To enable vectorization, install with```bashMARCH_NATIVE=1 pip install diffcp```OpenMP can be enabled by passing extra arguments to your compiler. For example, on linux, you can tell gcc to activate the OpenMP extension by specifying the flag &quot;-fopenmp&quot;:```bashOPENMP_FLAG=&quot;-fopenmp&quot; pip install diffcp```To enable both vectorization and OpenMP (on linux), use```bashMARCH_NATIVE=1 OPENMP_FLAG=&quot;-fopenmp&quot; pip install diffcp```### Cone programs`diffcp` differentiates through a primal-dual cone program pair. The primal problem must be expressed as ```minimize        c'xsubject to      Ax + s = b                s in K```where  `x` and `s` are variables, `A`, `b` and `c` are the user-supplied problem data, and `K` is a user-defined convex cone. The corresponding dual problem is```minimize        b'ysubject to      A'y + c == 0                y in K^*```with dual variable `y`.### Usage`diffcp` exposes the function```pythonsolve_and_derivative(A, b, c, cone_dict, warm_start=None, solver=None, **kwargs).```This function returns a primal-dual solution `x`, `y`, and `s`, along withfunctions for evaluating the derivative and its adjoint (transpose).These functions respectively compute right and left multiplication of the derivativeof the solution map at `A`, `b`, and `c` by a vector.The `solver` argument determines which solver to use; the available solversare `solver=&quot;SCS&quot;` and `solver=&quot;ECOS&quot;`.If no solver is specified, `diffcp` will choose the solver itself.In the case that the problem is not solved, i.e. the solver fails for some reason, we will raisea `SolverError` Exception.#### ArgumentsThe arguments `A`, `b`, and `c` correspond to the problem data of a cone program.* `A` must be a [SciPy sparse CSC matrix](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csc_matrix.html).* `b` and `c` must be NumPy arrays.* `cone_dict` is a dictionary that defines the convex cone `K`.* `warm_start` is an optional tuple `(x, y, s)` at which to warm-start. (Note: this is only available for the SCS solver).* `**kwargs` are keyword arguments to forward to the solver (e.g., `verbose=False`).These inputs must conform to the [SCS convention](https://github.com/bodono/scs-python) for problem data. The keys in `cone_dict` correspond to the cones, with* `diffcp.ZERO` for the zero cone,* `diffcp.POS` for the positive orthant,* `diffcp.SOC` for a product of SOC cones,* `diffcp.PSD` for a product of PSD cones, and* `diffcp.EXP` for a product of exponential cones.The values in `cone_dict` denote the sizes of each cone; the values of `diffcp.SOC`, `diffcp.PSD`, and `diffcp.EXP` should be lists. The order of the rows of `A` must match the ordering of the cones given above. For more details, consult the [SCS documentation](https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs/blob/master/README.md).#### Return valueThe function `solve_and_derivative` returns a tuple```python(x, y, s, derivative, adjoint_derivative)```* `x`, `y`, and `s` are a primal-dual solution.* `derivative` is a function that applies the derivative at `(A, b, c)` to perturbations `dA`, `db`, `dc`. It has the signature ```derivative(dA, db, dc) -&gt; dx, dy, ds```, where `dA` is a SciPy sparse CSC matrix with the same sparsity pattern as `A`, and `db` and `dc` are NumPy arrays. `dx`, `dy`, and `ds` are NumPy arrays, approximating the change in the primal-dual solution due to the perturbation.* `adjoint_derivative` is a function that applies the adjoint of the derivative to perturbations `dx`, `dy`, `ds`. It has the signature ```adjoint_derivative(dx, dy, ds) -&gt; dA, db, dc```, where `dx`, `dy`, and `ds` are NumPy arrays.#### Example```pythonimport numpy as npfrom scipy import sparseimport diffcpcone_dict = {    diffcp.ZERO: 3,    diffcp.POS: 3,    diffcp.SOC: [5]}m = 3 + 3 + 5n = 5A, b, c = diffcp.utils.random_cone_prog(m, n, cone_dict)x, y, s, D, DT = diffcp.solve_and_derivative(A, b, c, cone_dict)# evaluate the derivativenonzeros = A.nonzero()data = 1e-4 * np.random.randn(A.size)dA = sparse.csc_matrix((data, nonzeros), shape=A.shape)db = 1e-4 * np.random.randn(m)dc = 1e-4 * np.random.randn(n)dx, dy, ds = D(dA, db, dc)# evaluate the adjoint of the derivativedx = cdy = np.zeros(m)ds = np.zeros(m)dA, db, dc = DT(dx, dy, ds)```For more examples, including the SDP example described in the paper, see the [`examples`](examples/) directory.### CitingIf you wish to cite `diffcp`, please use the following BibTex:```@article{diffcp2019,    author       = {Agrawal, A. and Barratt, S. and Boyd, S. and Busseti, E. and Moursi, W.},    title        = {Differentiating through a Cone Program},    journal      = {Journal of Applied and Numerical Optimization},    year         = {2019},    volume       = {1},    number       = {2},    pages        = {107--115},}@misc{diffcp,    author       = {Agrawal, A. and Barratt, S. and Boyd, S. and Busseti, E. and Moursi, W.},    title        = {{diffcp}: differentiating through a cone program, version 1.0},    howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/cvxgrp/diffcp}},    year         = 2019}```The following thesis concurrently derived the mathematics behind differentiating cone programs.```@phdthesis{amos2019differentiable,  author       = {Brandon Amos},  title        = {{Differentiable Optimization-Based Modeling for Machine Learning}},  school       = {Carnegie Mellon University},  year         = 2019,  month        = May,}```</longdescription>
