	<longdescription>=============Insights Core=============Insights Core is a data collection and analysis framework that is builtfor extensibility and rapid development.  Included are a set of reusablecomponents for gathering data in myriad ways and providing a reliableobject model for commonly useful unstructured and semi-structured data... code-block:: python    &gt;&gt;&gt; from insights import run    &gt;&gt;&gt; from insights.parsers import installed_rpms as rpm    &gt;&gt;&gt; lower = rpm.Rpm(&quot;bash-4.4.11-1.fc26&quot;)    &gt;&gt;&gt; upper = rpm.Rpm(&quot;bash-4.4.22-1.fc26&quot;)    &gt;&gt;&gt; results = run(rpm.Installed)    &gt;&gt;&gt; rpms = results[rpm.Installed]    &gt;&gt;&gt; rpms.newest(&quot;bash&quot;)    0:bash-4.4.12-7.fc26    &gt;&gt;&gt; lower &lt;= rpms.newest(&quot;bash&quot;) &lt; upper    TrueFeatures--------* Over 200 Enterprise Linux data parsers* Support for Python 2.6+ and 3.3+* Built in support for local host collection* Data collection support for several archive formatsInstallation------------Releases can be installed via pip.. code-block:: shell    $ pip install insights-coreDocumentation-------------There are several resources for digging into the details of how to use ``insights-core``:- A `detailed walk through of the constructing a rule  &lt;https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-core/blob/master/docs/notebooks/Diagnostic%20Walkthrough.ipynb&gt;`_- The `insights-core-tutorials project docs &lt;https://insights-core-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_  have three tutorials plus instructions on how to setup the tutorial environment  - `Preparing Your Development Environment    &lt;https://insights-core-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prep_tutorial_env.html&gt;`_  - `Custom Parser Development    &lt;https://insights-core-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customtut_parsers.html&gt;`_  - `Custom Combiner Development    &lt;https://insights-core-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/combiner_tutorial.html&gt;`_  - `Rule Development    &lt;https://insights-core-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rule_tutorial_index.html&gt;`_- The basic architectural principles of ``insights-core`` can be found in  the `Insights Core  &lt;https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-core/blob/master/docs/notebooks/Insights%20Core%20Tutorial.ipynb&gt;`_ tutorial jupyter notebook- A simple `stand_alone.py  &lt;https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-core/blob/master/examples/rules/stand_alone.py&gt;`_  script encapsulates creating all the basic components in a single script  that can be easily executed locally- Some `quick-start examples  &lt;https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-core/blob/master/examples&gt;`_  are provided in the ``examples`` directory. Each subdirectory under examples  includes a ``README.md`` file that provides a description of the contents  and usage information.To Run the Jupyter Notebooks++++++++++++++++++++++++++++If you would like to execute the jupyter notebooks locally, you caninstall jupyter:.. code-block:: bash    pip install jupyterTo start the notebook server:.. code-block:: bash    jupyter notebookThis should start a web-server and open a tab on your browser.  Fromthere, you can navigate to ``docs/notebooks`` and select a notebook ofinterest.Motivation----------Almost everyone who deals with diagnostic files and archives such assosreports or JBoss server.log files eventually automates the process ofrummaging around inside them. Usually, the automation is comprised offairly simple scripts, but as these scripts get reused and shared, theircomplexity grows and a more sophisticated design becomes worthwhile.A general process one might consider is:#. Collect some unstructured data (e.g. from a command, an archive, a   directory, directly from a system)#. Convert the unstructured data into objects with standard APIs.#. Optionally combine some of the objects to provide a higher level   interface than they provide individually (maybe all the networking   components go together to provide a high level API, or maybe multiple   individual objects provide the same information. Maybe the same   information can be gotten from multiple sources, not all of which are   available at the same time from a given system or archive).#. Use the data model above at any granularity to write rules that   formalize support knowledge, persisters that build database tables,   metadata components that extract contextual info for other systems,   and more.Insights Core provides this functionality. It is an extensible frameworkfor collecting and analyzing data on systems, from archives,directories, etc. in a standard way.Insights Core versus Red Hat Insights-------------------------------------A common confusion about this project is how it relates to `Red HatInsights &lt;https://access.redhat.com/insights/&gt;`_.  Red Hat Insights is aproduct produced by `Red Hat &lt;https://www.redhat.com&gt;`_ for automateddiscovery and remediation of issues in Red Hat products.  The``insights-core`` project is used by Red Hat Insights, but only representsthe data collection and rule analysis infrastructure.  Thisinfrastructure is meant to be reusable by other projects.So, ``insights-core`` can be used for individuals wanting to performanalysis locally, or integrated into other diagnostics systems.  Parsersor rules written using ``insights-core`` can be executed in Red HatInsights, but, it is not a requirement.</longdescription>
