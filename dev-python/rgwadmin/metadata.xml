	<longdescription># rgwadmin[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/rgwadmin/badge/?version=latest)](https://rgwadmin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)rgwadmin is a Python library to access the Ceph Object Storage Admin API.http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/adminops/## API Example Usage```pythonfrom rgwadmin import RGWAdminrgw = RGWAdmin(access_key='XXX', secret_key='XXX', server='obj.example.com')rgw.create_user(    uid='liam',    display_name='Liam Monahan',    email='liam@umiacs.umd.edu',    user_caps='usage=read, write; users=read',    max_buckets=1000)rgw.set_user_quota(    uid='liam',    quota_type='user',    max_size_kb=1024*1024,    enabled=True)rgw.remove_user(uid='liam', purge_data=True)```## User Example Usage```pythonfrom rgwadmin import RGWAdmin, RGWUserRGWAdmin.connect(access_key='XXX', secret_key='XXX', server='obj.example.com')u = RGWUser.create(user_id='test', display_name='Test User')u.user_quota.size = 1024 * 1024  # in bytesu.user_quota.enabled = Trueu.save()u.delete()```## Requirementsrgwadmin requires the following Python packages: * [requests](http://python-requests.org/) * [requests-aws4auth](https://github.com/tedder/requests-aws4auth)Additionally, you need to have a [Ceph](http://www.ceph.org) Object Storageinstance with a user that has appropriate caps (capabilities) on the parts ofthe API that you want to access.  See the[Ceph Object Storage](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/) page for moreinformation.Version 2.3.1 was the last to support Python 2.  As of version 2.4.0 we support using V4 signing for requests to the Ceph RGW Admin server only.### Compatibilityrgwadmin implements all documented Admin API operations or recent versions ofCeph.  We also implement some of the undocumented ones, too...## Installation```pip install rgwadmin```## License    rgwadmin - a Python interface to the Rados Gateway Admin API    Copyright (C) 2015  UMIACS    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
