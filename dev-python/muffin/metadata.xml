Pull requestswith documentation enhancements and/or fixes are awesome and most welcome.**.. _contents:.. contents::.. _requirements:.. _installation:Installation------------We recommend using the latest version of Python. The library supports Python3.8 and newer (PyPy-3.9+ are supported too).Muffin should be installed using pip: ::    pip install muffinThe command will install minimal configuration.To install Muffin with `gunicorn`, `uvicorn`, `uvloop`, `httptools` use thecommand:.. code-block:: console  $ pip install muffin[standard]Dependencies````````````These distributions will be installed automatically when installing **Muffin**.* `ASGI-Tools`_ - ASGI_ Toolkit* `Modconfig`_  - Simple hierarchic configuration manager.. _ASGI-Tools: https://klen.github.io/asgi-tools/.. _Modconfig: https://pypi.org/project/modconfig/.. _quickstart:Quickstart----------Example &quot;Hello User&quot; with the Muffin:.. code-block:: python    import muffin    app = muffin.Application()    @app.route('/', '/hello/{name}')    async def hello(request):        name = request.path_params.get('name', 'world')        return f'Hello {name.title()}!'What did that code do?1. First we imported the ``muffin.Application`` class.  An instance of   this class will be our application.2. Next we create an instance of this class.3. We then use the ``muffin.Application.route`` decorator to tell Muffin   what URLs should trigger our handler function.4. The function returns the message we want to display in the user's browser.Save the script as `example.py` and run it using Uvicorn (or another ASGI_ server): ::    $ uvicorn example:appOpen http://localhost:8000, http://localhost:8000/hello/username in your browser. Enjoy!.. TODO: Finish the general example..
