	<longdescription>pylabels is a Python library for creating PDFs to print sheets oflabels. It uses the `ReportLab PDFtoolkit &lt;http://www.reportlab.com/opensource/&gt;`_ to producethe PDF.Basically, the user creates a set of specifications of the label sizesetc, writes a callback function which does the actual drawing, and givesthese two items to a Sheet object. Items are then added to the sheetusing the add\_label() method (or add\_labels() to add all items from aniterable).The callback function is called once for each item, being given aReportLab Drawing object representing the label, its width and height,and the item to draw on the label. Any of the standard ReportLab drawingmethods can be used, with pylabels automatically adding a clipping patharound each label to prevent it interfering with other labels.Once all the items have been added, the labels can be saved as a PDF, ora preview of a page can be saved as an image.Website-------pylabels is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/bcbnz/pylabels/Examples--------The following examples are available in the demos directory on GitHub:-  `Basic &lt;https://github.com/bcbnz/pylabels/blob/1.2.1/demos/basic.py&gt;`_ - a introduction to the basic use of   pylabels.-  `Partial pages &lt;https://github.com/bcbnz/pylabels/blob/1.2.1/demos/partial_page.py&gt;`_ - how to produce partial   pages (i.e., pages with some of the labels previously used).-  `Background colours &lt;https://github.com/bcbnz/pylabels/blob/1.2.1/demos/background_colours.py&gt;`_ - examples of solid,   striped and hatched backgrounds of different colours on each label.-  `Page background &lt;https://github.com/bcbnz/pylabels/blob/1.2.1/demos/page_background.py&gt;`_ - how to add a background   image for each page.-  `Padding &lt;https://github.com/bcbnz/pylabels/blob/1.2.1/demos/padding.py&gt;`_ - how to add padding to the labels.-  `Nametags &lt;https://github.com/bcbnz/pylabels/blob/1.2.1/demos/nametags.py&gt;`_ - creates a set of nametags from the   list of names in the names.txt file. Includes the use of two custom   fonts, font size selection, and centred text.-  `Image preview &lt;https://github.com/bcbnz/pylabels/blob/1.2.1/demos/preview.py&gt;`_ - generates image previews of   two of the pages from the nametags demo.Demo fonts----------The following fonts are used in the demo scripts and are included in thedemos folder:-  Judson Bold - http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/judson (Open Font   License)-  KatamotzIkasi - http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/katamotzikasi   (GPL)License-------Copyright (C) 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 Blair Bonnettpylabels is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify itunder the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by theFree Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at youroption) any later version.pylabels is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUTANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY orFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
