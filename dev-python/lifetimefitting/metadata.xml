	<longdescription># LifetimeFittingToolThis is a quick tool I wrote to take some of my TCSPC fluorescence lifetime fitting tools from [spectraImport.ipynb](https://github.com/adreasnow/excided-state-notebooks/blob/main/spectraImport.ipynb) and make them usable for other people. It can read PicoHarp .phd files thanks to [adreasnow/picoharp-phd](https://github.com/adreasnow/picoharp-phd) and also reads the plain `.txt` output it can save.![screenshot](screenshot.png)The app itself is a basic least squares regression tool but allows you to fit in linear or logarithmic space, supports up to 4 decays, and can export images as well as .csv files of the fitted histograms## Installing### PyPiThe easiest way to get it is to install it directly from pypy, so as too pull all the dependencies:```pythonpip install lifetimefitting```### Manually* Python (I'm not sure how old you could go, but I know it runs on &gt;3.9)* Matplotlib* Numpy* PyQt6* ScipyThese can be installed pretty easily via pip```bashpip install matplotlib numpy scipy pyqt6```or conda```bashconda install matplotlib numpy scipy pyqt6```Then you can clone the module down and install it manually```bashgit clone https://github.com/adreasnow/LifetimeFittingTool.gitcd LifetimeFittingToolpython setup.py install```## UsageTo run the app, all you need to do is execute the module in python and a QT window should appear :)```bashpython -m lifetimefitting```## The MathsUses the form of the function:$$fl(t)=I_0 exp\bigg(-\frac{t}{\tau}\bigg)$$Where:* $t =$ Time* $\tau =$ Fluorescence lifetime* $I_0 =$ Initial photon concentrationFor the corrected fitting procedure, the convolved function is calculated as:$$fl=fl(t)_{IRF}\otimes fl(t)$$$$fl_{fitted}=\sum_{i=1}^{\text{exponents}} C_i\cdot fl(t)_i$$Where:* $fl(t)_{IRF} =$ Fitted instrument response function* $fl(t)_i =$ Fitted function for each decay* $C_i =$ Linear coefficient for each decay$\chi^2$ is calculated as per [fluortools](http://www.fluortools.com/software/decayfit/documentation/fit)$$\chi^2 = \sum_{j=1}^{n} (c_j-\hat{c_j})^2/\hat{c_j}\\\chi^2_{red}=\frac{\chi^2}{n}$$</longdescription>
