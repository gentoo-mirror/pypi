If you prefer to use this index, include the parameter:```pythonindex_raw=True```If you're dumping from multiple modules to the same folder, you're guaranteed to have collisions. You should include the parameter:```Pythonwith_folder=True```## development:https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.htmlCreate a python virtual environment in this directory:```python -m venv dev```activate virtual environment:```source ./dev/bin/activate```install [maturin (crates.io)](https://crates.io/crates/maturin) or from [pipi](https://pypi.org/project/maturin/)run test library:```maturin develop```# LicenseThe xmodits python library is licensed under the LGPLv3</longdescription>
