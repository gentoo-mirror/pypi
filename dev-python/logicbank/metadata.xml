	<longdescription>Logic Bank governs SQLAlchemyupdate transaction logic - multi-table derivations, constraints,and actions such as sending mail or messages. Logic consists of both:* **Rules - 40X** more conciseusing a spreadsheet-like paradigm, and* **Python - control and extensibility,**using standard tools and techniques&gt; The example described below is a _typical_ example of multi-table logic.&gt;&gt; You may find it helpful to begin with [this Tutorial, using a basic example](../../wiki/Tutorial).&gt;&gt;&gt; **Update - Jan 26, 2021:** You can use LogicBank for your own _existing_ projects.  For _new_ projects, the recommended approach is [**ApiLogicServer**](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer#readme) - create a complete logic-enabled JSON:API for your database, and a admin app, with 1 command.This readme contains:1.

[Project Information](#project-information)# Background## Why - Simple Cocktail-Napkin Spec Explodes into Massive Legacy CodeIf you've coded backend database logic - multi-table derivations and constraints -you know how much work it is, and how tedious.  Whether you code it intriggers and stored procedures, in ORM events, or UI controllers, it's a lot:typically nearly half the effort for a database project.It's also incredibly repetitive - you often get the feeling you're doing the same thing over and over.And you're right.  It's because backend logic follows patterns of &quot;what&quot; is supposed to happen.And your code is the &quot;how&quot;.  Suddenly, a simple cocktail napkin specification explodes into a massive amount of legacy code:&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/blob/main/images/overview/rules-vs-code.png?raw=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Logic Bank was designed to make the cocktail napkin spec _executable_.## What - Declare Spreadsheet-like Rules - 40X More ConciseLogic Bank introduces rules that are 40X more concise than legacy code.The 5 rules below (lines 40-49) express the same logic as 200 lines of code [**(see them here)**](examples/nw/logic/legacy).  That's because rules are all about &quot;what&quot;-- spreadsheet-like expressions that automate the tedious &quot;how&quot;:&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/blob/main/images/overview/cocktail-logic-bank.png?raw=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;### Standard Python - Declare, Extend, ManageLogic Bank is fully integrated with Python:* **Declare** rules in Python as shown above (more details in How, below)* **Extend** rules with Python (rule on line 51 invokes the Python function on line 32)* **Manage** logic using your existing IDE (PyCharm, VSCode etc for code completion, debugging, etc),and source control tools and procedures### Technology Evaluation40X is... _large_ - do these results hold in practice?See [here](../../wiki#technology-evaluation) foradditional background, and real world experience.## How - Usage and Operation Overview&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/blob/main/images/architecture.png?raw=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Logic Bank operates as shown above: 1. **Declare and Activate** (see example above):    a. Create a ```declare_logic``` function (above, line 12),    and declare your rules using ```Rule.``` (e.g., with IDE code completion)     b. After opening your database, call ```activate```    to register your rules, and establish Logic Bank as    a listener for SQLAlchemy ```before_flush``` events         2. Your application operates as usual: makes calls on `SQLAlchemy` for inserts, updates and deletes    and issues `session.commit()`    - By bundling transaction logic into SQLAlchemy data access, your logic  is automatically shared, whether for hand-written code (Flask apps, APIs)       3. The **Logic Bank** engine handles SQLAlchemy `before_flush` events on`Mapped Tables`, so executes when you issue ```session.commit()```     4. The logic engine operates much like a spreadsheet:    - **watch** for changes at the attribute level    - **react** by running rules that referenced changed attributes, which can    - **chain** to still other attributes that refer to_those_ changes.  Note these might be in different tables,providing automation for _multi-table logic_Logic does not apply to updates outside SQLAlchemy,nor to SQLAlchemy batch updates or unmapped sql updates.Let's see how logic operates on a typical, multi-table transaction.### Logic Execution: Add Order - Watch, React, Chain&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/blob/main/images/check-credit.png?raw=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;The `add_order` example illustrates how__Watch / React / Chain__ operates tocheck the Credit Limit as each OrderDetail is inserted:1.  The `OrderDetail.UnitPrice` (copy, line 49) references Product, so inserts cause it to be copied    2.  `Amount` (formula, line 48) watches `UnitPrice`, so its new value recomputes `Amount`    3.  `AmountTotal` (sum, line 46) watches `Amount`, so `AmountTotal` is adjusted (more on adjustment, below)    4.  `Balance` (sum, line 43) watches `AmountTotal`, so it is adjusted    5.  And the Credit Limit constraint (line 40) is checked (exceptions are raised if constraints are violated, and the transaction is rolled back)    All of the dependency management to see which attributes have changed,logic ordering, the SQL commands to read and adjust rows, and the chainingare fully automated by the engine, based solely on the rules above.### Spreadsheet-like Automatic ReuseJust as a spreadsheet reactsto inserts, updates and deletes to a summed column,rules automate _adding_, _deleting_ and _updating_ orders.This is how 5 rules represent the same logic as 200 lines of code.Check out more examples:* [**Ship Order**](../../wiki/Ship-Order) illustrates *cascade*, another form of multi-table logic* [**Banking**](../../wiki/Sample-Project---Banking) is a complex transaction using the command pattern### Scalability: Automatic Prune / Optimize logicScalability requires more than clustering - SQLs must be prunedand optimized.  For example, the balance rule:* is **pruned** if only a non-referenced column is altered (e.g., Shipping Address)* is **optimized** into a 1-row _adjustment_ update instead of anexpensive SQL aggregateFor more on how logic automates and optimizes multi-table transactions,[click here](../../wiki#scalability-automatic-pruning-and-optimization).## An Agile PerspectiveThe core tenant of agile is    Working software, driving collaboration, for rapid iterationsHere's how rules can help.#### Working Software _Now_The examples above illustrate how just a few rules can replace [pages of code](examples/nw/logic/legacy).#### Iteration - Automatic OrderingRules are _self-ordering_ - they recognize their interdependencies,and order their execution and database access (pruning, adjustments etc)accordingly.  This means:* order is independent - you can state the rules in any orderand get the same result* maintenance is simple - just make changes, additions and deletions,the engine will reorganize execution order and database access, automatically# InstallationFirst, follow the instructions to verify / install Python, then install Logic Bank.### Python InstallationThe first section below verifies whether your Python environment is current.The following section explains how to install a current Python environment.#### Verify Pre-reqs: Python 3.8, virtualenv, pip3Ensure you have these pre-reqs:```python --version# requires 3.8 or higher (Relies on `from __future__ import annotations`, so requires Python 3.8)pip --version# version 19.2.3 or higher... you might be using pip3pyenv --version# 1.2.19 or higher```#### Install Python (if required)If you are missing any, install them as described here.  Skip this step if your pre-reqs are fine.To install Python:* Python3.8    * Run the windows installer      * Be sure to specify &quot;add Python to Path&quot;   * On mac/Unix, consider [using homebrew](https://brew.sh/), as described[here](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac#what-to-do)   * virtualenv - see [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fpackaging.python.org%2Fguides%2Finstalling-using-pip-and-virtual-environments%2F%23creating-a-virtual-environment&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEu-ZbYfqRMjNQ0D0DqU1mhFpDYmw)  (e.g.,  `pip install virtualenv`)   * on PC, see [these instructions](https://pypi.org/project/pyenv-win/)* An IDE - optional - any will do (I've used [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), install notes [here](https://github.com/valhuber/fab-quick-start/wiki/IDE-Setup)), though different install / generate / run instructions apply for running programs.Issues?
