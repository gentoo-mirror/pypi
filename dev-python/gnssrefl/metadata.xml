You will see a bias in time series when you switched. This bug is fixed as of version 1.4.1I will be removing all versions (1.3.16 up to 1.4.1) from pypi that have this bug. If you were using the newarcs option in the last month, you need to rerun gnssir and any downstream codes (subdaily, daily_avg etc). This bug has no impact on the data translation codes (rinex2snr, nmea2snr).  How do you find out which version are you running? Type &lt;code&gt;pip list | grep gnssrefl&lt;/code&gt;Our documentation is available [here.](https://gnssrefl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)If you want to sign up for the GNSS-IR email list, please contact Kristine Larson.[Youtube videos for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC1NW5oS7liG7C8NBK148Bg).If you want to access CDDIS, including orbits, you should make [an account](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new).If you want to access to any Earthscope data, [an account is required](https://data-idm.unavco.org/user/profile/login).&lt;HR&gt; GNSS-IR was developed with funding from NSF (ATM 0740515, EAR 0948957, AGS 0935725, EAR 1144221, AGS 1449554) and NASA (NNX12AK21G and NNX13AF43G). &lt;code&gt;gnssrefl&lt;/code&gt; was initially developed as a fun post-retirement project, followed by support from NASA (80NSSC20K1731).Kristine M.
