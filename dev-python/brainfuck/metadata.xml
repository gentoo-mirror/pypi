	<longdescription>Package Overview================You thought **Brainfuck** was bad? Think again. Get ready to meet...EPIC BRAINFUCK==============|Motivation==========Contrary to many other codebases, this repository is not just about writing yet **another** Brainfuck compiler. Just search &quot;brainfuck&quot; on GitHub, and you'll seejust how many people have already written compilers, and how many different languagesit has been written in. It's incredible for a language so basic and rudimentary, howmuch attention it has garnered over the years. Indeed, it is quite the brainteaser towrite stuff using only eight characters.|However, &quot;brainteaser&quot; is perhaps a euphemism for the language's actual name, so I began to think: how can I crank up the &quot;brain-teasing&quot; if you'd like and make this language even more difficult to work with? The answer? Who said that ``&gt;`` means ``++ptr``, where ``ptr`` pointsto an &quot;infinitely long&quot; ``char`` array? Why can't we use other characters to signify that? And whosaid we needed to have concrete aliases for these bits of C code? This is where this Brainfuck package deviates from most. Not only did I write an interpreter for &quot;traditional&quot; Brainfuck code, but I also wrote **several** variants in which the syntax ofBrainfuck changes from interpretation to interpretation. Toss in some unexpected behaviors (e.g. massive file write out of nowhere), and there you have it: **EPIC** Brainfuck shenanigans!|Documentation=============For more information about documentation, please click `here &lt;https://github.com/gfyoung/brainfuck/blob/master/README.md/&gt;`_. In addition, every provided Pythonmodule has extensive documentation for each class and function defined.   |Bugs and Features=================Find a bug in the code?
