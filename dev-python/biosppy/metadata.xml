	<longdescription># BioSPPy - Biosignal Processing in Python*A toolbox for biosignal processing written in Python.*[![Image](https://github.com/PIA-Group/BioSPPy/raw/master/docs/logo/logo_400.png &quot;I know you're listening! - xkcd.com/525&quot;)](http://biosppy.readthedocs.org/)The toolbox bundles together various signal processing and pattern recognitionmethods geared towards the analysis of biosignals.Highlights:- Support for various biosignals: BVP, ECG, EDA, EEG, EMG, PCG, PPG, Respiration- Signal analysis primitives: filtering, frequency analysis- Clustering- BiometricsDocumentation can be found at: &lt;http://biosppy.readthedocs.org/&gt;## InstallationInstallation can be easily done with `pip`:```bash$ pip install biosppy```## Simple ExampleThe code below loads an ECG signal from the `examples` folder, filters it,performs R-peak detection, and computes the instantaneous heart rate.```pythonfrom biosppy import storagefrom biosppy.signals import ecg# load raw ECG signalsignal, mdata = storage.load_txt('./examples/ecg.txt')# process it and plotout = ecg.ecg(signal=signal, sampling_rate=1000., show=True)```This should produce a plot similar to the one below.[![Image](https://github.com/PIA-Group/BioSPPy/raw/master/docs/images/ECG_summary.png &quot;ECG Summary Plot&quot;)]()## Dependencies- bidict- h5py- matplotlib- numpy- scikit-learn- scipy- shortuuid- six- joblib## CitingPlease use the following if you need to cite BioSPPy:- Carreiras C, Alves AP, Louren√ßo A, Canento F, Silva H, Fred A, *et al.*  **BioSPPy - Biosignal Processing in Python**, 2015-,  https://github.com/PIA-Group/BioSPPy/ [Online; accessed ```&lt;year&gt;-&lt;month&gt;-&lt;day&gt;```].```latex@Misc{,  author = {Carlos Carreiras and Ana Priscila Alves and Andr\'{e} Louren\c{c}o and Filipe Canento and Hugo Silva and Ana Fred and others},  title = {{BioSPPy}: Biosignal Processing in {Python}},  year = {2015--},  url = &quot;https://github.com/PIA-Group/BioSPPy/&quot;,  note = {[Online; accessed &lt;today&gt;]}}```## LicenseBioSPPy is released under the BSD 3-clause license.
