	<longdescription># QrM - Qt5 based file explorer for reMarkableUse a Qt5 based UI to ~manage~ view, upload, delete content of/to yourreMarkable I/II via SSH.[Project page](https://projects.om-office.de/frans/qrm)## UsageOnce configured run `qrm` to start up a UI, connect to and see a list of content on a (WiFi enabledand switched on) reMarkable device. Drag and drop EPUB and PDF files onto the window to make themavailable on the device.Run `qrm [ls|list]` to list content on the connected deviceRun `qrm [upload|push] &lt;FILE&gt; [&lt;FILE&gt;]` to copy stuff onto the connected deviceRun `qrm info` to see configuration and stuffRun `qrm reboot` to .. you know..Run `qrm config-auth &lt;KEY&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt; ...` to configure stuff, e.g.Please note that currently reMarkable will not recognize file modifications done via SSH - to makenew files available you'll have to reboot the device. Run `qrm reboot` or press the `Reboot` buttonto do this via SSH (or reboot it manually).### ConfigurationIn the UI just enter your credentials, they're getting saved automatically.The command line interface allows persistant configuration using the `config-auth` sub-command:```qrm config-auth host=192.168.178.13 password='s0rry_Pl4in+ex+!'```Please note that currently only connection via IP address (rather than hostname) and plaintextpassword is working. This is subject to change (&quot;of course&quot;).## ToDo for v1.0* Allow hostnames instead of IP addresses* Make use of shared keys and configuration in `~/.ssh/config`* Support drag&amp;drop to add content in UI* Support deletion* Support Pdf* Support web pages via Pdf## Future features* Download and manage notes* Make backups* Other convenience stuff via SSH, e.g. installing software## Installation```pip3 install [--user] [--upgrade] qrm```## Development &amp; Contribution```# provide dependencies, consider also using pyenvpip3 install -U poetry pre-commitgit clone --recurse-submodules https://projects.om-office.de/frans/qrm.gitcd qrm# activate a pre-commit gate keeperpre-commit install# if you need a specific version of Python inside your dev environmentpoetry env use ~/.pyenv/versions/3.10.4/bin/python3poetry install```## LicenseFor all code contained in this repository the rules of GPLv3 apply unlessotherwise noted.
