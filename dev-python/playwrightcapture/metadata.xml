	<longdescription># Playwright CaptureSimple replacement for [splash](https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash) using [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python).# Install```bashpip install playwrightcapture```# UsageA very basic example:```pythonfrom playwrightcapture import Captureasync with Capture() as capture:    await capture.prepare_context()    entries = await capture.capture_page(url)```Entries is a dictionaries that contains (if all goes well) the HAR, the screenshot, all the cookies of the session, the URL as it is in the browser at the end of the capture, and the full HTML page as rendered.# reCAPTCHA bypassNo blackmagic, it is just a reimplementation of a [well known technique](https://github.com/NikolaiT/uncaptcha3)as implemented [there](https://github.com/Binit-Dhakal/Google-reCAPTCHA-v3-solver-using-playwright-python),and [there](https://github.com/embium/solverecaptchas).This modules will try to bypass reCAPTCHA protected websites if you install it this way:```bashpip install playwrightcapture[recaptcha]```This will install `requests`, `pydub` and `SpeechRecognition`. In order to work, `pydub`requires `ffmpeg` or `libav`, look at the [install guide ](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub#installation)for more details.`SpeechRecognition` uses the Google Speech Recognition API to turn the audio file into text (I hope you appreciate the irony).</longdescription>
