	<longdescription>**CONTRIBUTORS WANTED!!**# Installation`pip install python-soql-parser`or, with poetry`poetry add python-soql-parser`# Usage```pythonfrom python_soql_parser import parseparse_result = parse(&quot;SELECT Id FROM Account&quot;)```where `parse_result` is a [ParseResults](https://pyparsing-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/HowToUsePyparsing.html#parseresults) object from [pyparsing](https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/).# Notable caveats## Unsupported features- Subqueries (e.g., `SELECT Name, (SELECT LastName FROM Contacts) FROM Account`)- Aggregate queries- SOQL specific WHERE-clause tokens (e.g., `LAST_N_DAYS:&lt;integer&gt;`)## Partially supportedThese are either partially supported or weakly supported- Related attributes (e.g., `SELECT Id, Account.Name FROM Contact`). The object name is not yet parsed out on its own. This will simply parse out `&quot;Account.Name&quot;`# ContributingA lot of work remains to be done. Practically no SOQL-specific features are supported as of yet.If you want to contribute, just open a PR! (and add a test for your new feature)## Setting up locallyFirst install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Afterwards, to install the dependencies, run```poetry install```## Running the testsSimply execute```pytest```## House cleaningPlease sort imports with `isort` and format the code with `black` (in that order).</longdescription>
