	<longdescription># Python MPV JSONIPCThis implements an interface similar to `python-mpv`, but it uses the JSON IPC protocol instead of the C API. This meansyou can control external instances of MPV including players like SMPlayer, and it can use MPV players that are prebuiltinstead of needing `libmpv1`. It may also be more resistant to crashes such as Segmentation Faults, but since it isn'tdirectly communicating with MPV via the C API the performance will be worse.Please note that this only implements the subset of `python-mpv` that is used by `plex-mpv-shim` and`jellyfin-mpv-shim`. Other functionality has not been implemented.## Installation```bashsudo pip3 install python-mpv-jsonipc```## Basic usageCreate an instance of MPV. You can use an already running MPV or have the library start amanaged copy of MPV. Command arguments can be specified when initializing MPV if you arestarting a managed copy of MPV.Please also see the [API Documentation](https://github.com/iwalton3/python-mpv-jsonipc/blob/master/docs.md).```pythonfrom python_mpv_jsonipc import MPV# Uses MPV that is in the PATH.mpv = MPV()# Use MPV that is running and connected to /tmp/mpv-socket.mpv = MPV(start_mpv=False, ipc_socket=&quot;/tmp/mpv-socket&quot;)# Uses MPV that is found at /path/to/mpv.mpv = MPV(mpv_location=&quot;/path/to/mpv&quot;)# After you have an MPV, you can read and set (if applicable) properties.mpv.volume # 100.0 by defaultmpv.volume = 20 # You can also send commands.mpv.command_name(arg1, arg2)# Bind to key press events with a decorator@mpv.on_key_press(&quot;space&quot;)def space_handler():    pass# You can also observe and wait for properties.@mpv.property_observer(&quot;eof-reached&quot;)def handle_eof(name, value):    pass# Or simply wait for the value to change once.mpv.wait_for_property(&quot;duration&quot;)```</longdescription>
