You can ask for help via `GitHubdiscussions`_ and report bugs and give other kinds of feedback via `GitHubissues`_. Support is provided gladly, time and other engagements permitting, butcannot be guaranteed... _GitHub: https://github.com/dlukes/corpy.. _GitHub discussions: https://github.com/dlukes/corpy/discussions.. _GitHub issues: https://github.com/dlukes/corpy/issuesWhat is CorPy?==============A fancy plural for *corpus* ;) Also, a collection of handy but not especiallymutually integrated tools for dealing with linguistic data. It abstracts awayfunctionality which is often needed in practice for teaching and/or day to daywork at the `Czech National Corpus &lt;https://korpus.cz&gt;`__, without aspiring tobe a fully featured or consistent NLP framework.Here's an idea of what you can do with CorPy:- add linguistic annotation to raw textual data using either `UDPipe  &lt;https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/udpipe.html&gt;`__ or `MorphoDiTa  &lt;https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/morphodita.html&gt;`__- `easily generate word clouds  &lt;https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/vis.html&gt;`__- run code in `a sanitized global environment  &lt;https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/no_globals.html&gt;`__ (useful for  debugging in interactive sessions, e.g. with Jupyter notebooks in `JupyterLab  &lt;https://jupyterlab.rtfd.io&gt;`__)- `generate phonetic transcripts of Czech texts  &lt;https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/phonetics_cs.html&gt;`__- `wrangle corpora in the vertical format  &lt;https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/vertical.html&gt;`__ devised originally  for `CWB &lt;http://cwb.sourceforge.net/&gt;`__, used also by `(No)SketchEngine  &lt;https://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske/&gt;`__- plus some `command line utilities  &lt;https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/cli.html&gt;`__.. note::   **Should I pick UDPipe or MorphoDiTa?**   Both are developed at `ÚFAL MFF UK`_. UDPipe_ has more features at the cost   of being somewhat more complex: it does both `morphological tagging   (including lemmatization) and syntactic parsing   &lt;https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/udpipe.html&gt;`__, and it handles a   number of different input and output formats. You can also download   `pre-trained models &lt;http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe/models&gt;`__ for many   different languages.   By contrast, MorphoDiTa_ only has `pre-trained models for Czech and English   &lt;http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/morphodita/users-manual&gt;`__, and only performs   `morphological tagging (including lemmatization)   &lt;https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/morphodita.html&gt;`__. However, its   output is more straightforward -- it just splits your text into tokens and   annotates them, whereas UDPipe can (depending on the model) introduce   additional tokens necessary for a more explicit analysis, add multi-word   tokens etc. This is because UDPipe is tailored to the type of linguistic   analysis conducted within the UniversalDependencies_ project, using the   CoNLL-U_ data format.   MorphoDiTa can also help you if you just want to tokenize text and don't have   a language model available... _`ÚFAL MFF UK`: https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/.. _UDPipe: https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe.. _MorphoDiTa: https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/morphodita.. _UniversalDependencies: https://universaldependencies.org.. _CoNLL-U: https://universaldependencies.org/format.html.. development-markerDevelopment===========Dependencies and building the docs----------------------------------``corpy`` needs to be installed in the ReadTheDocs virtualenv for ``autodoc`` towork. The optional dependencies in the ``doc`` group are also needed.
