	<longdescription># Isolate&gt; :warning: **Isolate** is still very young, and none of the APIs should be considered stable.Run any Python function, with any dependencies, in any machine you want. Isolate offers apluggable end-to-end solution for building, managing, and using isolated environments (virtualenv,conda, remote, and more).## Motivation![XKCD 1987](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png)The fact that nearly every piece of software uses some other libraries or someother programs is undeniable. Each of these come with their set of dependencies,and this chain moves forward. Once there are enough 'nodes' in the chain, thenthe [&quot;dependency mess&quot;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell) startsto surface and our lives become much harder.Python tried to solve it by recommending the &quot;virtual environment&quot; concept. Intheory it was designed to isolate environments of different projects, so my projectA can depend on `pandas==1.0.0` while B depends on `pandas==2.0.0` and whicheverproject I choose to work with, I just activate its own environment.Overall this was a very nice solution that did work, and still continues to workfor this use case. But as with every other scoped fix, in time other problems startedto appear that demand a much narrower scope (like defining module-level dependencies,or even function-level ones for cloud runtimes that allow seamless integration with therest of your code running in a different machine).However, unlike &quot;virtual environment&quot; concept, each of the projects that tried to tacklethis problem lacked a universal interface which one can simply define a set of requirements(this might be dependencies, size of the machine that is needed to run it, or something completelydifferent) and can change it without any loss. Isolate is working towards a future where thistransititon is as seamless as the transition from your local environment to the remoteenvironment.</longdescription>
