	<longdescription>Tinyarrays are similar to NumPy arrays, but optimized for small sizes.Common operations on very small arrays are to 3-7 times faster than withNumPy (with NumPy 1.6 it used to be up to 35 times), and 3 times lessmemory is used to store them.  Tinyarrays are useful if you need manysmall arrays of numbers, and cannot combine them into a few large ones.(The resulting code is still much slower than C, but it may now be fastenough.)Unlike Python's built-in tuples, Tinyarrays support mathematicaloperations like element-wise addition and matrix multiplication.  UnlikeNumpy arrays, Tinyarrays can be used as dictionary keys because they arehashable and immutable.  What is more, tinyarrays are equivalent totuples with regard to hashing and comparisons: a dictionary or set withtinyarray keys may by transparently indexed by tuples.The module's interface is a subset of that of NumPy and thus should befamiliar to many.  Whenever an operation is missing from Tinyarray,NumPy functions can be used directly with Tinyarrays.</longdescription>
