Please be patient because I'm not used to the job yet, but I'll do my best.Many and infinite thanks to Randall Degges for his wonderful work. I'm actually using thelibrary in some project of mine, so I'm more than happy to help and push it further if I can.I'm happy to accept pull requests and cut releases as needed.If you want to contribute to the project, please do!Purpose-------pyst2 consists of a set of interfaces and libraries to allow programming ofAsterisk from python. The library currently supports AGI, AMI, and the parsingof Asterisk configuration files. The library also includes debugging facilitiesfor AGI.This project has been forked from pyst (http://sf.net/projects/pyst/) becauseit was impossible for me to contact the project maintainer (after severalattempts), and I'd like to bring the project up-to-date, fix bugs, and makeit more usable overall.My immediate plans include adding full documentation, re-writing someof the core routines, adding a test suite, and accepting pull requests.If you are one of the current maintainers, and would like to take over thefork, please contact me: r@rdegges.com, so we can get that setup!Installation------------To install ``pyst2``, simply run:.. code-block:: console    $ pip install pyst2This will install the latest version of the library automatically.Documentation-------------Documentation is currently only in python docstrings, you can usepythons built-in help facility:: import asterisk help (asterisk) import asterisk.agi help (asterisk.agi) import asterisk.manager help (asterisk.manager) import asterisk.config help (asterisk.config)Some notes on platforms: We now specify &quot;platforms = 'Any'&quot; in``setup.py``. This means, the manager part of the package will probablyrun on any platform. The agi scripts on the other hand are calleddirectly on the host where Asterisk is running. Since Asterisk doesn'trun on windows platforms (and probably never will) the agi part of thepackage can only be run on Asterisk platforms.FastAGI-------FastAGI support is a python based raw SocketServer, To start the serverpython fastagi.py should start it listening on localhost and the defaultasterisk FastAGI port. This does require the newest version of pyst2.The FastAGI server runs in as a Forked operation for each request, inan attempt to prevent blocking by a single bad service. As a result theFastAGI server may consume more memory then a single process. If you needto use a single process simply uncomment the appropriate line. Future versionsof this will use a config file to set options.Credits-------Thanks to Karl Putland for writing the original package.Thanks to Matthew Nicholson for maintaining the package for some yearsand for handing over maintenance when he was no longer interested.Thanks to Randall Degges for maintaining this for and acceptingpull requests.Things to do for pyst---------------------This is the original changelog merged into the readme file. I'm not sosure I really want to change all these things (in particular thethreaded implementation looks good to me). I will maintain a sectionsummarizing the changes in this README. Detailed changes will beavailable in the version control tool (currently git).* ChangeLog:  The ChangeLog needs to be updated from the monotone logs.* Documentation:  All of pyst's inline documentation needs to be updated.* manager.py:  This should be converted to be single threaded.  Also there is a race  condition when a user calls manager.logoff() followed by  manager.close().  The close() function may still call logoff again if  the socket thread has not yet cleared the _connected flag.  A class should be made for each manager action rather than having a  function in a manager class.  The manager class should be adapted to  have a send method that know the general format of the classes.Matthew Nicholson writes on the mailinglist (note that I'm not sure I'll dothis, I'm currently satisfied with the threaded implementation):  For pyst 0.3 I am planning to clean up the manager.py.  There are  several know issues with the code.  No one has actually reported these  as problems, but I have personally had trouble with these.  Currently  manager.py runs in several threads, the main program thread, a thread to  read from the network, and an event distribution thread.  This causes  problems with non thread safe code such as the MySQLdb libraries.  This  design also causes problems when an event handler throws an exception  that causes the event processing thread to terminate.  The second problem is with the way actions are sent.  Each action has a  specific function associated with it in the manager object that takes  all possible arguments that may ever be passed to that action.  This  makes the api somewhat rigid and the Manager object cluttered.  To solve these problems I am basically going to copy the design of my  Astxx manager library (written in c++) and make it more python like.  Each action will be a different object with certain methods to handle  various tasks, with one function in the actual Manager class to send the  action.  This will make the Manager class much smaller and much more  flexible.  The current code will be consolidated into a single threaded  design with hooks to have the library process events and such.  These  hooks will be called from the host application's main loop.</longdescription>
