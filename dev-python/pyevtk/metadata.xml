I take no credit whatsoever for it.My fork is hosted under:https://github.com/pyscience-projects/pyevtkThis package is nowadays primarily maintained by [Ren√© Fritze](https://github.com/renefritze) and [Xylar Asay-Davis](https://github.com/xylar).INTRODUCTION:=============EVTK (Export VTK) package allows exporting data to binary VTK files forvisualization and data analysis with any of the visualization packages thatsupport VTK files, e.g.  Paraview, VisIt and Mayavi. EVTK does not depend on anyexternal library (e.g. VTK), so it is easy to install in different systems.Since version 0.9 the package is composed only of a set of pure Python files, henceit is straightforwrd to install and run in any system where Python is installed.EVTK provides low and high level interfaces.  While the low level interfacecan be used to export data that is stored in any type of container, the highlevel functions make easy to export data stored in Numpy arrays.INSTALLATION:=============This package is being hosted on PyPI under:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyEVTKand can be installed with pip using `pip install pyevtk`DOCUMENTATION:==============This file together with the included examples in the examples directory in thesource tree provide enough information to start using the package.DESIGN GUIDELINES:==================The design of the package considered the following objectives:1. Self-contained. The package does not require any external library withthe exception of Numpy, which is becoming a standard package in many Pythoninstallations.2. Flexibility. It is possible to use EVTK to export data stored in anycontainer and in any of the grid formats supported by VTK by using the low levelinterface.3. Easy of use. The high level interface makes very easy to export data storedin Numpy arrays. The high level interface provides functions to export most ofthe grids supported by VTK: image data, rectilinear and structured grids. Italso includes a function to export point sets and associated data that can beused to export results from particle and meshless numerical simulations.4. Performance. The aim of the package is to be used as a part ofpost-processing tools. Thus, good performance is important to handle the resultsof large simulations.  However, latest versions give priority to ease of installationand use over performance.REQUIREMENTS:=============    - Numpy. Tested with Numpy 1.11.3.The package has been tested on:    - MacOSX 10.6 x86-64.    - Ubuntu 10.04 x86-64 guest running on VMWare Fusion.    - Ubuntu 12.04 x86-64 running Python Anaconda (3.4.3)    - Windows 7 x86-64 running Python Anaconda (3.4.3)It is compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.3. Since version 0.9 it is only compatiblewith VTK 6.0 and newer versions.DEVELOPER NOTES:================It is useful to build and install the package to a temporary location withouttouching the global python site-packages directory while developing. To dothis, while in the root directory, one can type:    1. python setup.py build --debug install --prefix=./tmp    2. export PYTHONPATH=./tmp/lib/python2.6/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATHNOTE: you may have to change the Python version depending of the installedversion on your system.To test the package one can run some of the examples, e.g.:./tmp/lib/python2.6/site-packages/examples/points.pyThat should create a points.vtu file in the current directory.SUPPORT:=======I will continue releasing this package as open source, so it is free to be used in any kind of project.I will also continue providing support for simple questions and making incremental improvements as timeallows. However, I also  provide contract based support for commercial or research projects interestedin this package or in topics related to data analysis and scientific programming with Python, Java, MATLAB/Octave, C/C++ or Fortran.For further details, please contact me to: paulo.herrera.eirl@gmail.com.**NOTE: PyEVTK moved to GitHub.
