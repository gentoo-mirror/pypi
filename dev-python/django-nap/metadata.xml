	<longdescription>django-nap==========Read The Docs: https://django-nap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Change log: https://django-nap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.htmlAn API library for DjangoA minimalist approach to object de/serialisers, RESTful views, and RPC views.Benefits--------1. Modular    Unlike some tools, the Serialiser definition is separate from the API.    This not only makes it easier to have different 'shapes' of data for    different endpoints, but also allows using them in more places, not just    your API.1. Simple    If you want an API that provides every feature ever, go look at Django REST    Framework.  But if you want something simple and fast, this is your tool.Overview========Installing----------It is NOT necessary to add nap to your INSTALLED\_APPS.  It does not providemodels, templates, template tags, or static files.Tests are currently run for Python 3.4-3.7 and pypy3, and against Djangoversions 2.0 and up.</longdescription>
