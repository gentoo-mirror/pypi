	<longdescription>Face Recognition================| Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line  with| the world's simplest face recognition library.| Built using `dlib &lt;http://dlib.net/&gt;`__'s state-of-the-art face  recognition| built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the| `Labeled Faces in the Wild &lt;http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/&gt;`__  benchmark.| This also provides a simple ``face_recognition`` command line tool  that lets| you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line!| |PyPI|| |Build Status|| |Documentation Status|Features--------Find faces in pictures^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Find all the faces that appear in a picture:|image3|.. code:: python    import face_recognition    image = face_recognition.load_image_file(&quot;your_file.jpg&quot;)    face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)Find and manipulate facial features in pictures^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Get the locations and outlines of each person's eyes, nose, mouth andchin.|image4|.. code:: python    import face_recognition    image = face_recognition.load_image_file(&quot;your_file.jpg&quot;)    face_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)| Finding facial features is super useful for lots of important stuff.  But you can also use for really stupid stuff| like applying `digital  make-up &lt;https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/digital_makeup.py&gt;`__  (think 'Meitu'):|image5|Identify faces in pictures^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Recognize who appears in each photo.|image6|.. code:: python    import face_recognition    known_image = face_recognition.load_image_file(&quot;biden.jpg&quot;)    unknown_image = face_recognition.load_image_file(&quot;unknown.jpg&quot;)    biden_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(known_image)[0]    unknown_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_image)[0]    results = face_recognition.compare_faces([biden_encoding], unknown_encoding)You can even use this library with other Python libraries to doreal-time face recognition:|image7|See `thisexample &lt;https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/facerec_from_webcam_faster.py&gt;`__for the code.Installation------------Requirements^^^^^^^^^^^^-  Python 3.3+ or Python 2.7-  macOS or Linux (Windows not officially supported, but might work)Installing on Mac or Linux^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^First, make sure you have dlib already installed with Python bindings:-  `How to install dlib from source on macOS or   Ubuntu &lt;https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/629d75c1baac34dfa5ca2a1928a7aeaf&gt;`__Then, install this module from pypi using ``pip3`` (or ``pip2`` forPython 2):.. code:: bash    pip3 install face_recognition| If you are having trouble with installation, you can also try out a| `pre-configured  VM &lt;https://medium.com/@ageitgey/try-deep-learning-in-python-now-with-a-fully-pre-configured-vm-1d97d4c3e9b&gt;`__.Installing on Raspberry Pi 2+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-  `Raspberry Pi 2+ installation   instructions &lt;https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/1ac8dbe8572f3f533df6269dab35df65&gt;`__Installing on Windows^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^While Windows isn't officially supported, helpful users have postedinstructions on how to install this library:-  `@masoudr's Windows 10 installation guide (dlib +   face\_recognition) &lt;https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/175#issue-257710508&gt;`__Installing a pre-configured Virtual Machine image^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-  `Download the pre-configured VM   image &lt;https://medium.com/@ageitgey/try-deep-learning-in-python-now-with-a-fully-pre-configured-vm-1d97d4c3e9b&gt;`__   (for VMware Player or VirtualBox).Usage-----Command-Line Interface^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^| When you install ``face_recognition``, you get a simple command-line  program| called ``face_recognition`` that you can use to recognize faces in a| photograph or folder full for photographs.| First, you need to provide a folder with one picture of each person  you| already know. There should be one image file for each person with the| files named according to who is in the picture:|known|Next, you need a second folder with the files you want to identify:|unknown|| Then in you simply run the command ``face_recognition``, passing in| the folder of known people and the folder (or single image) with  unknown| people and it tells you who is in each image:.. code:: bash    $ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/    /unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama    /face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person| There's one line in the output for each face. The data is  comma-separated| with the filename and the name of the person found.| An ``unknown_person`` is a face in the image that didn't match anyone  in| your folder of known people.Adjusting Tolerance / Sensitivity'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''| If you are getting multiple matches for the same person, it might be  that| the people in your photos look very similar and a lower tolerance  value| is needed to make face comparisons more strict.| You can do that with the ``--tolerance`` parameter. The default  tolerance| value is 0.6 and lower numbers make face comparisons more strict:.. code:: bash    $ face_recognition --tolerance 0.54 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/    /unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama    /face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person| If you want to see the face distance calculated for each match in  order| to adjust the tolerance setting, you can use ``--show-distance true``:.. code:: bash    $ face_recognition --show-distance true ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/    /unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama,0.378542298956785    /face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person,NoneMore Examples'''''''''''''| If you simply want to know the names of the people in each photograph  but don't| care about file names, you could do this:.. code:: bash    $ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/ | cut -d ',' -f2    Barack Obama    unknown_personSpeeding up Face Recognition''''''''''''''''''''''''''''| Face recognition can be done in parallel if you have a computer with| multiple CPU cores. For example if your system has 4 CPU cores, you  can| process about 4 times as many images in the same amount of time by  using| all your CPU cores in parallel.If you are using Python 3.4 or newer, pass in a``--cpus &lt;number_of_cpu_cores_to_use&gt;`` parameter:.. code:: bash    $ face_recognition --cpus 4 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/You can also pass in ``--cpus -1`` to use all CPU cores in your system.Python Module^^^^^^^^^^^^^| You can import the ``face_recognition`` module and then easily  manipulate| faces with just a couple of lines of code.

It tends to mix   up children quite easy using the default comparison threshold of 0.6.Deployment to Cloud Hosts (Heroku, AWS, etc)--------------------------------------------| Since ``face_recognition`` depends on ``dlib`` which is written in  C++, it can be tricky to deploy an app| using it to a cloud hosting provider like Heroku or AWS.| To make things easier, there's an example Dockerfile in this repo that  shows how to run an app built with| ``face_recognition`` in a `Docker &lt;https://www.docker.com/&gt;`__  container. With that, you should be able to deploy| to any service that supports Docker images.Common Issues-------------Issue: ``Illegal instruction (core dumped)`` when usingface\_recognition or running examples.| Solution: ``dlib`` is compiled with SSE4 or AVX support, but your CPU  is too old and doesn't support that.| You'll need to recompile ``dlib`` after `making the code change  outlined  here &lt;https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/11#issuecomment-287398611&gt;`__.Issue:``RuntimeError: Unsupported image type, must be 8bit gray or RGB image.``when running the webcam examples.Solution: Your webcam probably isn't set up correctly with OpenCV. `Lookhere formore &lt;https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/21#issuecomment-287779524&gt;`__.Issue: ``MemoryError`` when running ``pip2 install face_recognition``| Solution: The face\_recognition\_models file is too big for your  available pip cache memory. Instead,| try ``pip2 --no-cache-dir install face_recognition`` to avoid the  issue.Issue:``AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'face_recognition_model_v1'``Solution: The version of ``dlib`` you have installed is too old.
