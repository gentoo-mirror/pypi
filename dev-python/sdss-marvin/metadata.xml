	<longdescription>Marvin======Marvin is the ultimate tool to visualise and analyse MaNGA data. It isdeveloped and maintained by the MaNGA team.|Build Package| |Run Test Suite| |CodeCov| |Coverage Status| |PyPI| |DOI| |astropy||readthedocs|Installation------------To install Marvin:::    pip install sdss-marvinIf you would like to contribute to Marvin's development, you can clonethis git repo, and run pip install in editable mode which will install all thedev dependencies:::    git clone https://github.com/sdss/marvin    cd marvin    pip install -e &quot;.[dev,web,db]&quot;This will install all dependencies needed for development and testing, including forthe Marvin web/api server and the Marvin use of the MaNGA database.Testing-------To run the test suite on Marvin, use ``pytest tests/``.  By default this will run all tests againstMarvin's core file access mode, as well as its database and remote access modes. The test suite usesthe following two galaxies: `8485-1901` and `7443-12701` for testing. To successfully run all testsyou will need:*  The file data for the two test galaxies*  A local MaNGA database with the galaxy loaded into it*  A local Marvin web server runningYou can download the necessary test data with the command.::   python bin/get_test_data.pyYou can run a local Marvin web server with the following command.  This will start a local web server runningin debug mode on port 5000.::   cd bin/   run_marvin -d -p 5000You can disable database and web server tests by using Pytest markers.  The availble markers and options are:*  **slow**: Run only slow tests.*  **uses_db**: Run only tests that use the database.*  **uses_web**: Run only tests that use the web/api server.*  **--local-only**: Run only tests that use local data.To run the test suite minimally against the core marvin package with local file access, use the following command:::   pytest --local-only -m &quot;not uses_db and not uses_web and not slow&quot; tests/What is Marvin?---------------Marvin is a complete ecosystem designed for overcoming the challenge ofsearching, accessing, and visualizing the MaNGA data. It consists of athree-pronged approach of a web app, a python package, and an API. Theweb app, Marvin-web, provides an easily accessible interface forsearching the MaNGA data and visual exploration of individual MaNGAgalaxies or of the entire sample. The python package, in particularMarvin-tools, allows users to easily and efficiently interact with theMaNGA data via local files, files retrieved from the `Science ArchiveServer &lt;https://sas.sdss.org&gt;`__, or data directly grabbed from thedatabase. The tools come mainly in the form of convenience functions andclasses for interacting with the data. An additional tool is a powerfulquery functionality that uses the API to query the MaNGA databases andreturn the search results to your python session. Marvin-API is thecritical link that allows Marvin-tools and Marvin-web to interact withthe databases, which enables users to harness the statistical power ofthe MaNGA data set.Documentation-------------You can find the latest Marvin documentation`here &lt;http://sdss-marvin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`__.Citation and Acknowledgements-----------------------------If you use Marvin for work/research presented in a publication (whetherdirectly, or as a dependency to another package), we ask that you citethe `Marvin Software &lt;https://zenodo.org/record/292632&gt;`__ (BibTeX).
