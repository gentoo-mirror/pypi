	<longdescription># IDAES ToolkitThe IDAES Toolkit aims to provide multi-scale, simulation-based, open sourcecomputational tools and models to support the design, analysis, optimization,scale-up, operation and troubleshooting of innovative, advanced energy systems.&lt;!-- BEGIN Status badges --&gt;## Project Build and Download Statuses[![Tests](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/actions/workflows/core.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/actions/workflows/core.yml)[![Integration](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/actions/workflows/integration.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/actions/workflows/integration.yml)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/IDAES/idaes-pse/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=1lNQNbSB29)](https://codecov.io/gh/IDAES/idaes-pse)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/idaes-pse/badge/?version=latest)](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)[![Services](https://github.com/Pyomo/jenkins-status/blob/main/idaes_services.svg)](https://pyomo-jenkins.sandia.gov/)[![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/IDAES/idaes-pse.svg)](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/graphs/contributors)[![Merged PRs](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-pr-closed-raw/IDAES/idaes-pse.svg?label=merged+PRs)](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/pulls?q=is:pr+is:merged)[![Issue stats](http://isitmaintained.com/badge/resolution/IDAES/idaes-pse.svg)](http://isitmaintained.com/project/IDAES/idaes-pse)[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/idaes-pse)](https://pepy.tech/project/idaes-pse)&lt;!-- END Status badges --&gt;## Getting StartedOur [complete documentation is online](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) but here is a summarized set of steps to get started using the framework.While not required, we encourage the installation of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and using the `conda` command to create a separate python environment in which to install the IDAES Toolkit.Use conda to create a new &quot;idaes-pse&quot; (could be any name you like) environment then activate that environment:```bashconda create --name idaes-pse python=3.10conda activate idaes-pse```Now, in that &quot;idaes-pse&quot; environment, install the IDAES Toolkit using either `pip install` or `conda install` (but not both):```bash# install latest stable releasepip install idaes-pse# install latest stable release with one set of optional dependencies, e.g. `ui` for the user interfacepip install &quot;idaes-pse[ui]&quot;# install latest stable release with multiple sets of optional dependenciespip install &quot;idaes-pse[ui,dmf,omlt,grid,coolprop]&quot;# install latest version from the main branch of this repositorypip install &quot;idaes-pse @ git+https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse@main&quot;# install from the `mybranch` branch of the fork belonging to `myuser`pip install &quot;idaes-pse @ git+https://github.com/myuser/idaes-pse@mybranch&quot;```You can check the version installed with the command:```bashidaes --version```Now install the pre-built extensions (binary solvers):```bashidaes get-extensions```The IDAES examples can be installed by running:```bashpip install idaes-examples```For more information, refer to the [IDAES/examples](https://github.com/IDAES/examples) repository, as well as the online static version of the examples available at &lt;https://idaes-examples.readthedocs.org&gt;.Finally, refer to the [complete idaes-pse documentation](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest) for detailed [installation instructions](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/getting_started/index.html), examples, guides, and reference.## System requirementsThe code and examples have been tested with the following operating systems:|Operating system|Supported versions  ||----------------|--------------------|| Linux          | Any modern Linux   || Windows        | Windows 10         || macOS          | Partly supported*  |*HSL is not currently provided for macOS on Intel processors, so some features may be limited or not available.Most of the functionality is implemented in Python. In accordance withthe end-of-life for many Python 2 libraries, the IDAES Toolkit is writtenfor Python 3. The following sub-versions are supported:* Python 3.8* Python 3.9* Python 3.10* Python 3.11Note that Python 3.6 is *not* supported.## Contacts and more informationGeneral, background and overview information is available at the [IDAES main website](https://www.idaes.org).Framework development happens at our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse) where you can ask questions by starting a [discussion](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/discussions), [report issues/bugs](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/issues) or [make contributions](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse/pulls).For further enquiries, send an email to: &lt;idaes-support@idaes.org&gt;## Funding acknowledgementsThis work was conducted as part of the [Institute for the Design of Advanced Energy Systems (IDAES)](https://idaes.org)with support through the [Simulation-Based Engineering, Crosscutting Research Program](https://netl.doe.gov/coal/simulation-based-engineering)within the U.S. Department of Energy’s [Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM)](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management).As of 2021, additional support was provided by FECM’s [Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Program](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/science-innovation/clean-coal-research/solid-oxide-fuel-cells),and [Transformative Power Generation Program](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/science-innovation/office-clean-coal-and-carbon-management/advanced-energy-systems/transformative).## ContributingPlease see our [Advanced User Installation](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/advanced_install/) and [How-to Guides](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_to_guides/) on how to work with the idaes-pse source code and contribute changes to the project.**By contributing to this repository, you are agreeing to all the terms set out in the LICENSE.md and COPYRIGHT.md files in this directory.**</longdescription>
