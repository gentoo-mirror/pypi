	<longdescription># json2daisyUtility for converting JSON board definitions into valid, [libDaisy](https://github.com/electro-smith/libDaisy) compatible C++ board support files for the [Daisy platform](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy).## InstallNote that this module is not intended as a standalone application at this time. You should not need to install it manually for most use cases.You can install this package with pip:~~~python -m pip install json2daisy~~~If you'd like to build the package and install locally, you'll need the `build` package:~~~python -m pip install build~~~Once that's set up, navigate to the root directory of json2daisy and run:~~~python3 -m buildpython3 -m pip install dist/json2daisy-0.2.0.tar.gz~~~If pip complains about a missing file, make sure you've entered the correct version number in the archive path.## UsageThis package can be used as a standalone program on the command line or as an imported module.On the command line:~~~python -m json2daisy path/to/board_description.json~~~As a module:~~~pythonimport json2daisy# If you want to generate from an Electrosmith board:header_string, board_name, component_info, component_aliases = json2daisy.generate_header_from_board('field')# If you're supplying custom JSONheader_string, board_name, component_info, component_aliases = json2daisy.generate_header_from_file('path/to/board_description.json')~~~As you can see, the two functions above will return a number of supplementary objects in addition to the header string. These provide detailed information for how to interact with the generated header. The `component_info` dictionary provides getters and setters for I/O, and the `component_aliases` dictionary provides valid aliases for everything in `component_info`. For examples of how to structure the board description, take a look at the JSON files in [src/json2daisy/resources](https://github.com/electro-smith/json2daisy/tree/main/src/json2daisy/resources).</longdescription>
