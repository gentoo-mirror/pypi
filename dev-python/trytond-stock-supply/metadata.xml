	<longdescription>Stock Supply Module###################The Stock Supply module add automatic supply mechanisms and introducethe concepts of order point.Order Point***********An order point define minimum, maximum and target quantities for a product on alocation.* The minimum quantity is the threshold quantity below which the provisioning  process will be triggered.* The maximum quantity is the threshold quantity above which the overflowing  process will be triggered.* The target quantity is the quantity that will be found in the location after  the provisioning / overflowing process has been completed.An order point also define a type which can be:* Internal  An Internal order point is defined on a Storage location, it also defines a  provisioning and/or an overflowing location. If the minimum quantity is  reached it will result in the creation of an internal shipment between the  provisioning location and the Storage location. If the maximum quantity is  reached it will result in the creation of an internal shipment between the  storage location and the overflowing location.* Purchase  A Purchase order point is defined on a warehouse location. If the  minimal quantity is reached on the warehouse it will result in a  purchase request.The internal shipments and purchase requests are created by the supply wizardwith respect to stock levels and existing shipments and requests. Thestock levels are computed between the next two supply dates computed over theSupply Period from the configuration (default: 1 day). If the stock level of aproduct without order point on the given warehouse is below zero, a purchaserequest is also created.  The same happens if the stock level of a storagelocation with a provisioning location is below zero. Likewise, if the stocklevel of a storage is above zero and an overflow location is defined on thelocation then an internal shipment will be created.</longdescription>
