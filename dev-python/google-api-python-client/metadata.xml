	<longdescription># Google API Client[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/google-api-python-client.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/google-api-python-client)This is the [Google API Python client library](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/client-libraries-explained#google_api_client_libraries)for Google's discovery based APIs. To get started, please see the[docs folder](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/blob/main/docs/README.md).This library is considered complete and is in maintenance mode. This meansthat we will address critical bugs and security issues but will not add anynew features.This library is officially supported by Google.  However, the maintainers ofthis repository recommend using [Cloud Client Libraries for Python](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python),where possible, for new code development. For more information, please visit[Client Libraries Explained](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/client-libraries-explained).## Version 2.0 ReleaseThe 2.0 release of `google-api-python-client` includes a substantial reliability improvement, compared with 1.x, as discovery documents are now cached in the library rather than fetched dynamically. It is highly recommended to upgrade from v1.x to v2.x.Only python 3.7 and newer is supported. If you are not able to upgrade python, thenplease continue to use version 1.x as we will continue supporting python 2.7+ in[v1](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/tree/v1).Discovery documents will no longer be retrieved dynamically whenyou call `discovery.build()`. The discovery documents will instead be retrievedfrom the client library directly. New versions of this library are released weekly.As a result of caching the discovery documents, the size of this package is at least 50 MB larger compared to the previous version. Please see the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/blob/main/UPGRADING.md)for more information.## DocumentationSee the [docs folder](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/blob/main/docs/README.md) for more detailed instructions and additional documentation.## Other Google API librariesThe maintainers of this repository recommend using[Cloud Client Libraries for Python](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python),where possible, for new code development due to the following reasons:With [Cloud Client Libraries for Python](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python):- There is a separate client library for each API, so you can choosewhich client libraries to download. Whereas, `google-api-python-client` is asingle client library for all APIs. As a result, the total package size for`google-api-python-client` exceeds 50MB.- There are stricter controls for breaking changes to the underlying APIsas each client library is focused on a specific API.- There are more features in these Cloud Client Libraries as each library isfocused on a specific API, and in some cases, the libraries are owned by teamwho specialized in that API.- Developers will benefit from intellisense.For more information, please visit[Client Libraries Explained](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/client-libraries-explained).Although there are many benefits to moving to[Cloud Client Libraries for Python](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python),the maintainers want to emphasize that `google-api-python-client` will continueto be supported.For Google Ads API, we recommend using [Google Ads API Client Library for Python](https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-python/).For Google Firebase Admin API, we recommend using [Firebase Admin Python SDK](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-python).## InstallationInstall this library in a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) using pip. virtualenv is a tool tocreate isolated Python environments. The basic problem it addresses is one ofdependencies and versions, and indirectly permissions.With virtualenv, it's possible to install this library without needing systeminstall permissions, and without clashing with the installed systemdependencies.### Mac/Linux```pip3 install virtualenvvirtualenv &lt;your-env&gt;source &lt;your-env&gt;/bin/activate&lt;your-env&gt;/bin/pip install google-api-python-client```### Windows```pip install virtualenvvirtualenv &lt;your-env&gt;&lt;your-env&gt;\Scripts\activate&lt;your-env&gt;\Scripts\pip.exe install google-api-python-client```## Supported Python VersionsPython 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 are fully supported and tested. This library may work on later versions of 3, but we do not currently run tests against those versions.## Unsupported Python VersionsPython &lt; 3.7## Third Party Libraries and DependenciesThe following libraries will be installed when you install the client library:* [httplib2](https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2)* [uritemplate](https://github.com/sigmavirus24/uritemplate)For development you will also need the following libraries:* [WebTest](https://pypi.org/project/WebTest/)* [pyopenssl](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyOpenSSL)## ContributingPlease see our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst).In particular, we love pull requests - but please make sure to signthe contributor license agreement.</longdescription>
