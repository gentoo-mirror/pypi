Logica is a successor to[Yedalog](https://research.google/pubs/pub43462/),a language created at Google earlier.## Why?Logica is for engineers, data scientists and other specialists who want to uselogic programming syntax when writing queries and pipelines to run on[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery).Logica compiles to StandardSQL and gives you access to the power of BigQueryengine with the convenience of logic programming syntax. This is useful becauseBigQuery is magnitudes more powerful than state of the art nativelogic programming engines.We encourage you to try Logica, especially if*   you already use logic programming and need more computational power, **or***   you use SQL, but feel unsatisfied about its readability, **or***   you want to learn logic programming and apply it to processing of Big Data.In the future we plan to support more SQL dialects and engines.## I have not heard of logic programming. What is it?Logic programming is a declarative programming paradigm where the program iswritten as a set of logical statements.Logic programming was developed in academia from the late 60s. Prolog andDatalog are the most prominent examples of logic programming languages. Logicais a language of the Datalog family.Datalog and relational databases start from the same idea: think of dataas relations and think of data manipulation as a sequence of operations overthese relations. But Datalog and SQL differ in how these operations aredescribed. Datalog is inspired by the mathematical syntax of the first orderpropositional logic and SQL follows the syntax of natural language.SQL was based on the natural language to give access to databases to the peoplewithout formal training in computer programming or mathematics. This conveniencemay become costly when the logic that you want to express is non trivial.There are many examples of hard-to-read SQL queries that correspond to simplelogic programs.## How does Logica work?Logica compiles the logic program into a SQL expression, so it can be executedon BigQuery, the state of the art SQL engine.Among database theoreticians Datalog and SQL are known to be _equivalent_. Andindeed the conversion from Datalog to SQL and back is often straightforward.However there are a few nuances, for example how to treat disjunction andnegation. In Logica we tried to make choices that make understanding of theresulting SQL structure as easy as possible, thus empowering user to writeprograms that are executed efficiently.## Why is it called _Logica_?_Logica_ stands for _**Logic** with **a**ggregation_.## How to learn?Learn basics of Logica with the [CoLab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/EvgSkv/logica/blob/main/tutorial/Logica_tutorial.ipynb) located at [`tutorial`](https://github.com/EvgSkv/logica/tree/main/tutorial) folder.See examples of using Logica in [`examples`](https://github.com/EvgSkv/logica/tree/main/examples) folder.Tutorial and examples show how to access Logica from CoLab. You can also install Logica command line tool.## PrerequisitesTo run Logica programs on BigQuery you will need a [Google Cloud Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate).Once you have a project you can run Logica programs in CoLab providing your project id.To run Logica locally you need [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).To initiate Logica predicates execution from the command line you will need `bq`, aBigQuery [command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bq-command-line-tool). For that you need to install [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).## InstallationGoogle Cloud Project is the only thing you need to run Logica in Colab, see[Hello World example](https://colab.research.google.com/github/EvgSkv/logica/blob/main/examples/Logica_example_Hello_World.ipynb).You can install Logica command with `pip` as follows.```sh# Install.python3 -m pip install logica# Run:# To see usage message.python3 -m logica# To print SQL for HelloWorld program.python3 -m logica - print Greet &lt;&lt;&lt;'Greet(greeting: &quot;Hello world!&quot;)'```If your `PATH` includes Python's `bin` folder then you will also be able torun it simply as```shlogica - print Greet &lt;&lt;&lt;'Greet(greeting: &quot;Hello world!&quot;)'```Alternatively, you can clone GitHub repository:```shgit clone https://github.com/evgskv/logicacd logica./logica - print Greet &lt;&lt;&lt;'Greet(greeting: &quot;Hello world!&quot;)'```## Code samplesHere a couple examples of how Logica code looks like.### Prime numbersFind prime numbers less than 30.Program `primes.l`:```# Define natural numbers from 1 to 29.N(x) :- x in Range(30);# Define primes.Prime(prime: x) :-  N(x),  x &gt; 1,  ~(    N(y),    y &gt; 1,    y != x,    x % y == 0  );```Running `primes.l````sh$ logica primes.l run Prime+-------+| prime |+-------+|     2 ||     3 ||     5 ||     7 ||    11 ||    13 ||    17 ||    19 ||    23 ||    29 |+-------+```### News mentionsWho was mentioned in the news in 2020 the most?Let's query [GDELT Project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) dataset.Program `mentions.l````@OrderBy(Mentions, &quot;mentions desc&quot;);@Limit(Mentions, 10);Mentions(person:, mentions? += 1) distinct :-  gdelt-bq.gdeltv2.gkg(persons:, date:),  Substr(ToString(date), 0, 4) == &quot;2020&quot;,  the_persons == Split(persons, &quot;;&quot;),  person in the_persons;```Running `mentions.l````$ logica mentions.l run Mentions+----------------+----------+|     person     | mentions |+----------------+----------+| donald trump   |  3624228 || joe biden      |  1591320 || los angeles    |  1221998 || george floyd   |   923472 || boris johnson  |   845955 || barack obama   |   541672 || vladimir putin |   486428 || bernie sanders |   409224 || andrew cuomo   |   375594 || nancy pelosi   |   375373 |+----------------+----------+```Note that cities of Los Angeles and Las Vegas are mentioned in this table due to knownmissclasification issue in the GDELT data analysis.## FeedbackFeel free to create [github issues](https://github.com/EvgSkv/logica/issues)for bugs and feature requests.You questions and comments are welcome at our [github discussions](https://github.com/EvgSkv/logica/discussions)!---Unless otherwise noted, the Logica source files are distributedunder the Apache 2.0 license found in the LICENSE file.This is not an officially supported Google product.</longdescription>
