Furthermore, [Python-Markdown][pymd] and [mistune][mistune] don't comply with CommonMark's spec. It is a good reason for me to develop a new markdown parser.Respecting that Marko complies with CommonMark's spec at the same time, which is a super complicated spec, Marko's performance will be affected. However, using a parserwhich doesn't comply with the CommonMark spec may give you unexpected rendered results from time to time.A benchmark result shows that Marko is 3 times slower than [Python-Markdown][pymd], but a bit faster than [Commonmark-py][cmpy], much slower than [mistune][mistune]. If performance is a bigger concern to you than spec compliance, you'd better choose another parser.[spec]: https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/[pymd]: https://github.com/waylan/Python-Markdown[mistune]: https://github.com/lepture/mistune[cmpy]: https://github.com/rtfd/CommonMark-py## Use MarkoThe installation is very simple:    $ pip install markoAnd to use it:```pythonimport markoprint(marko.convert(text))```Marko also provides a simple CLI, for example, to render a document and output to a html file:    $ cat my_article.md | marko &gt; my_article.html## ExtensionsIt is super easy to use an extension:```pythonfrom marko import Markdownfrom marko.ext.footnote import Footnote# Add footnote extensionmarkdown = Markdown(extensions=[Footnote])# Or you can just:markdown = Markdown(extensions=['footnote'])# Alternatively you can register an extension latermarkdown.use(Footnote)```An example of using an extension with the command-line version of Marko:```$ cat this_has_footnote.txt | marko -e footnote &gt; hi_world.html```Marko is shipped with 4 extensions: `'footnote', 'toc' 'pangu', 'codehilite'`.They are not included in CommonMark's spec but are common in other markdown parsers.Marko also provides a Github flavored markdown parser which can be found at `marko.ext.gfm.gfm`.Please refer to [Extend Marko](https://marko-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extend.html) about how towrite your own extension.## LicenseMarko is released under [MIT License](LICENSE)## [Change Log](CHANGELOG.md)</longdescription>
