	<longdescription># Adaptive Comfort MapAdaptive thermal comfort map recipe for Pollination.Compute spatially-resolved operative temperature and adaptive thermal comfort froma Honeybee model and EPW. Raw results are written into a `results/` folder andinclude CSV matrices of hourly operative temperatures and thermal conditions. Processedmetrics of Thermal Comfort Percent (TCP) can be found in the `metrics/` folder.## MethodsThis recipe uses EnergyPlus to obtain longwave radiant temperatures and indoor airtemperatures. The outdoor air temperature and air speed are taken directly fromthe EPW. All outdoor points are assumed to be at one half of the EPW meteorologicalwind speed (effectively representing wind speed at ground/human height).Longwave radiant temperatures are achieved by computing spherical view factorsfrom each sensor to the surfaces of the model using Radiance. These view factorsare then multiplied by the surface temperatures output by EnergyPlus to yieldlongwave MRT at each sensor. All indoor shades (eg. those representing furniture)are assumed to be at the room-average MRT. For outdoor sensors, the EnergyPlusoutdoor surface temperatures are used and each sensor's sky view is multiplied bythe EPW sky temperature to account for longwave radiant exchange with the sky.All outdoor context shades and the ground are assumed to be at the EPW airtemperature unless they have been modeled as Honeybee rooms.A Radiance-based enhanced 2-phase method is used for all shortwave MRT calculations,which precisely represents direct sun by tracing a ray from each sensor to thesolar position. The energy properties of the model geometry are what determinethe reflectance and transmittance of the Radiance materials in this shortwavecalculation.To determine Thermal Comfort Percent (TCP), the occupancy schedules of the energymodel are used. Any hour of the occupancy schedule that is 0.1 or greater will beconsidered occupied. For outdoor sensors, all hours are considered occupied.</longdescription>
