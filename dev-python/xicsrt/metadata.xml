	<longdescription>XICSRT: Photon based raytracing in Python=========================================Documentation: https://xicsrt.readthedocs.org  Git Repository: https://bitbucket.org/amicitas/xicsrt  Git Mirror: https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/xicsrtPurpose-------XICSRT is a general purpose, photon based, scientific raytracing code intendedfor both optical and x-ray raytracing. XICSRT includes handling for x-ray Bragg reflections from crystals which allows modeling of x-ray spectrometers and other x-ray systems. Care has been taken to allow for modeling of emission sources in real units and accurate preservation of photon statistics throughout. The XICSRT code has similar functionality to the well known [SHADOW] raytracing code, though the intention is to be a complementary tool rather than a replacement.  These two projects have somewhat different goals, and therefore different strengths.Current development is focused on x-ray raytracing for fusion science and high energy density physics (HEDP) research, in particular X-Ray Imaging Crystal Spectrometers for Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X), ITER and the National Ignition Facility (NIF).Installation------------XICSRT can be simply installed using `pip`    pip install xicsrtAlternatively it is possible to install from source using `setuptools`    python setup.py installUsage-----XICSRT is run by supplying a config dictionary to ```xicsrt.raytrace(config)```. The easiest way to run XICSRT is through a [Jupyter Notebook]. A command lineinterface is also available.To learn how format the input, and interpret the output, see the examplesprovided in the [documentation].[![Image][idocs] ][docs][docs]: https://xicsrt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest[idocs]: https://readthedocs.org/projects/docs/badge/?version=latest[documentation]: https://xicsrt.readthedocs.org[Jupyter Notebook]: https://jupyter.org/[SHADOW]: https://github.com/oasys-kit/shadow3</longdescription>
