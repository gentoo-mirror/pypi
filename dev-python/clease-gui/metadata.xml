The GUI works in both &quot;classic&quot; jupyternotebooks, and in Jupyter lab. Launch jupyter lab with:    $ jupyter-lab*Alternatively* to use the classic jupyter notebook, do:    $ jupyter notebookCreate a new notebook that you want to work in, and a new cell, add the following lines:```python%matplotlib tkfrom clease_gui import display_uidisplay_ui(dev_mode=True);```A line `%matplotlib notebook` can be added at the start of the cell for nicer plots(this only works in classic jupyter notebooks).However, this may come at a significant performance cost, so do your own testing.## Plot font sizesAll plots generated in this package are generated by the ``matplotlib`` package. However, the default font size in ``matplotlib`` can be rather small,so it can be adjusted globally, e.g. by running the following in a cell:```pythonimport matplotlibmatplotlib.rcParams.update({'font.size': 16})```This will also affect the font sizes on the figures generated in the GUI.</longdescription>
