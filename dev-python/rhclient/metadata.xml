	<longdescription>#### &lt;strong&gt;This software is the sole property of Prime Solutions Group, Inc.&lt;/strong&gt;# &lt;strong&gt;REST Harness - Python Client&lt;/strong&gt;REST Harness is a robust tool that acts to stand in place of another RESTful service. This can be used to mock out a service that doesn't exist yet or where there is a need to reproduce a particular set of inputs from an opaque service. It can also serve as a simple shared cache. This software runs as a daemon service by default. This library contains a client developed in Java that can be used to interact with the REST Harness web server.### RequirementsPython3, boto3 and requests.### Building the clientTo build:1. pull the source into any folder.2. Open a terminal and CD to the source folder.3. Use any of the python lifecycle phase flags with the prefix -m (so it is ran as a script), such as `build`.### Importing the client and using it in an applicationImporting the client is like installing and importing any other python dependency. To import:1. In your project environment, type `pip install rhclient`2. To use it in your scripts, type `from rhclient import client` where you'd normally import dependencies</longdescription>
