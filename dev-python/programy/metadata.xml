	<longdescription># Program-YProgram Y is a fully compliant AIML 2.1 chatbot framework written in Python 3. It includes an entire platform for building your own chat bots using Artificial Intelligence Markup Language, or AIML for short. For more information about Program-y, its features and its history then check out the Background page.q## New in 4.0### Baseline ReleaseVersion 4.0 is a baseline release to prepare the ground work for a number of major changes in 2020. It includes the addition of over 2000 unit tests which brings coverage up to 99% of the core system and 96% overallAlong with the unit tests, we have refactored major parts of the code base for ease of use, performance and long termsustainability. A number of defects have also been corrected due to the addition of the unit tests### Configuration ChangesThe major change is in the configuration file struture. This has been refactored and while a breaking change, its structural, rather than content and aligns the configuration files with the internal structure of the bot architecture. The main change is the inclusion of brains and bots contains, so a configuration file now looks like```yamlconsole:    bots:      bot1:        brains:          brain1:          brain2:      bot2:        brains:          brain3```Fixing config files should be as simple as introducing the bots and brains elements and shifting bot and brain elements a couple of tabs right### Embeddable ClientsThe third major feature is a complete refresh of the embeddable client, which now provides 3 simple ways to add a botto you Python app in as little as 2 lines of code```pythonfrom programy.clients.embed.basic import EmbeddedBasicBotmy_bot = EmbeddedBasicBot()print(&quot;Response = %s&quot; % my_bot.ask_question(&quot;Hello&quot;))```For more information on this feature, see [Embedded Bots](./Tutorial-Embedded-Bots)### Unified NamingA number of configuration items have had their names changed so that all variables use underscore '_' as a space seperator rather than a mix of underscore and dash '-'. The list of changes re* default_userid* default_get* default_property* default_map* default_response* default_response_sraiThe convention going forward is that all variables will use underscore '_' as a space seperator## ContactThere are a number of ways you can get help* [Github](https://github.com/keiffster/program-y/issues) Raise an issue directly* [Slack](https://program-y.slack.com) Talk live with the Dev Team* [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Program-y) Talk with the Dev Team* Email (See below) although I don't check it every day* Twitter, but more of an announcement channel</longdescription>
