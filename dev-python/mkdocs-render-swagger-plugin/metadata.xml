	<longdescription># mkdocs-render-swagger-pluginThis is the [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) plugin for rendering swagger &amp;amp; openapi schemas using [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/). It is written in Python.## UsageInstall the plugin using `pip install mkdocs-render-swagger-plugin`.Add the following lines to your mkdocs.yml:    plugins:      - render_swagger### Referencing a local jsonPlace an OpenAPI json file in the same folder as the `.md` file.Enter `!!swagger FILENAME!!` at the appropriate location inside the markdown file.### Referencing an external jsonYou may reference an external OpenAPI json using the following syntax: `!!swagger-http URL!!`.## Explicit declaration of the Swagger JS libraryYou can explicitly specify the swagger-ui css and js dependencies if you wish to not use the unpkg CDN.Keep in mind, the filename has to be `swagger-ui.css` for the CSS and `swagger-ui-bundle.js` for the JS.To specify this use `extra_javascript` and `extra_css` in your mkdocs.yaml:```yamlextra_javascript:  - assets/js/swagger-ui-bundle.jsextra_css:  - assets/css/swagger-ui.css```## Contributing &amp; Developing LocallyAfter downloading and extracting the `.tar.gz`, install this package locally using `pip` and the `--editable` flag:```bashpip install --editable .```You'll then have the `render-swagger` package available to use in Mkdocs and `pip` will point the dependency to this folder. You are then able to run the docs using `mkdocs serve`. Make sure you restart the process between code changes as the plugin is loaded on startup.## MkDocs plugins and Swagger apiThe Render Swagger MkDocs plugin uses a set of extensions and plugin APIs that MkDocs and Swagger UI supports.You can find more info about MkDocs plugins and Swagger UI on the official website of [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/) and [SwaggerUI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/docs/customization/plugin-api.md).The input OpenAPI files processed by the plugin should conform to the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/). It is generated by a few projects such as [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and others.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Disclaimer: This plugin is unofficial, and is not sponsored, owned or endorsed by mkdocs, swagger, or any other 3rd party.&lt;/br&gt;Credits to @aviramha for starting this project.&lt;/small&gt;</longdescription>
