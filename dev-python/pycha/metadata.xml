	<longdescription>.. contents::=====PyCha=====Pycha is a very simple Python package for drawing charts using the great`Cairo &lt;http://www.cairographics.org/&gt;`_ library. Its goals are:* Lightweight* Simple to use* Nice looking with default values* CustomizationIt won't try to draw any possible chart on earth but draw the most common onesnicely. There are some other options you may want to look at like`pyCairoChart &lt;http://bettercom.de/de/pycairochart&gt;`_.Pycha is based on `Plotr &lt;http://solutoire.com/plotr/&gt;`_ which is based on`PlotKit &lt;http://www.liquidx.net/plotkit/&gt;`_. Both libraries are written inJavaScript and are great for client web programming. I needed the same for theserver side so that's the reason I ported Plotr to Python. Now we can delivercharts to people with JavaScript disabled or embed them in PDF reports.Pycha is distributed under the terms of the `GNU Lesser General Public License&lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html&gt;`_.Documentation-------------You can find Pycha's documentation at http://packages.python.org/pychaDevelopment-----------You can get the last bleeding edge version of pycha by getting a clone ofthe Mercurial repository::  hg clone https://bitbucket.org/lgs/pychaDon't forget to check the`Release Notes &lt;http://packages.python.org/pycha/release-notes.html&gt;`_for each version to learn the new features and incompatible changes.Contact-------There is a mailing list about PyCha at http://groups.google.com/group/pychaYou can join it to ask questions about its use or simply to talk about itsdevelopment.
