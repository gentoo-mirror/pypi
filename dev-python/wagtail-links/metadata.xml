	<longdescription>=============Wagtail Links=============Purpose=======Wagtail links has two goals:- Provide a consistent way to refer to links, which may be of different types, so as to reduce decision fatigue- Minimize broken links as much as possible.Install=======Install wagtail-links via Pip... code:: bash    pip install wagtail-linksAdd ``wagtail_links`` to your Django project's INSTALLED_APPS setting.Run database migrations... code:: bash    python manage.py migrateUsage=====Add a foreign key to the page you wish to add links to... code:: python    my_link = models.ForeignKey(        'wagtail_links.Link',        null=True,        blank=True,        on_delete=models.SET_NULL,        related_name='+'    )Neat:.. image:: admin.pngYou may use it like:.. code:: html    &lt;a href=&quot;{{ self.link.url }}&quot;&gt;Link here&lt;/a&gt;From a template, you can also load a link by its name:.. code:: html    {% load get_wagtail_link_url from wagtail_links %}    &lt;a href=&quot;{% get_wagtail_link_url 'my-link' %}&quot;&gt;Link here&lt;/a&gt;This is useful for global page links, navigation, etc.Validation and logging======================The Link model will validate that one and only one field is set.It will also disallow invalid Django reverse view names.If a URL cannot be determined, we'll log the issue as a warning. We won't throw an exception as that would be bad for users. You are responsible for capturing this log warning, perhaps using Sentry.For example - let's say you make a Django view name called admin:index. This would typically give you `/admin/`. Later the admin application is removed from the program, now this link fails. It will now display &quot;&quot; and generate a warning in your server logs.</longdescription>
