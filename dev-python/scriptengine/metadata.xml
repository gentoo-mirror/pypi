	<longdescription># ScriptEngine![Tests](https://github.com/uwefladrich/scriptengine/actions/workflows/pytest.yml/badge.svg)![Test coverage](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/uwefladrich/scriptengine/badge.svg)![PyPI package](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scriptengine?color=green)![Conda-forge package](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/scriptengine?color=green)ScriptEngine is a lightweight and extensible framework for executing scriptswritten in YAML. The main purpose of ScriptEngine is to replace shell scriptsin situations where highly configurable and modular scripts are needed.ScriptEngine relies on [YAML](https://yaml.org/) and makes extensive use of[Jinja2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) templating to provide acomprehensive scripting language. This allows users to put focus on thedescription of tasks, rather than their implementation. The description ofcomplex tasks should be nearly as short and clear as for simpler ones.The ScriptEngine concept separates scripts (*what* to do) from theimplementation of tasks (*how* to do things), and also from the actualexecution environment (the script engine instances). This modularity allows theprovision of different execution models (e.g. sequential or parallel; local orremote) within the same framework.ScriptEngine provides a concise set of basic tasks that users can use to writetheir scripts. However, extensibility is a fundamental principle forScriptEngine. Complementary task sets are provided as Python packages that canbe loaded into ScriptEngine at run time. Thus, the capabilities of ScriptEnginescripts is only limited by available task sets.ScriptEngine tasks are simple Python classes with a `run()` method, which meansthat it is rather easy to build new tasks sets for particular needs. Andbecause everything is based on Python3, there is a wide range of modulesavailable to get the actual work done easily and efficiently.ScriptEngine is [open source](LICENSE) software, hosted at[GitHub](https://github.com/uwefladrich/scriptengine). Up-to-date ScriptEnginepackages are provided at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/scriptengine/) and[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/scriptengine), so installation isas easy as `pip install scriptengine` or `conda install scriptengine`.Documentation, including more detailed installation instructions, is publishedat [ReadtheDocs](https://scriptengine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).</longdescription>
