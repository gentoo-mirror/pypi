	<longdescription>geoh5py: Python API for geoh5. An open file format for geoscientific data==========================================================================The **geoh5py** library has been created for the manipulation and storage of a wide range ofgeoscientific data (points, curve, surface, 2D and 3D grids) in`geoh5 file format &lt;https://gist.github.com/jincandescent/06a3bd4e0e54360ad191&gt;`_.Users will be able to directly leverage the powerful visualizationcapabilities of `Geoscience ANALYST &lt;https://mirageoscience.com/mining-industry-software/geoscience-analyst/&gt;`_ along with open-source code from the Python ecosystem.Installation^^^^^^^^^^^^**geoh5py** is currently written for Python 3.7 or higher, and depends on `NumPy &lt;https://numpy.org/&gt;`_ and`h5py &lt;https://www.h5py.org/&gt;`_... note:: Users will likely want to take advantage of other packages available in the Python ecosystem.    We therefore recommend using `Anaconda &lt;https://www.anaconda.com/download/&gt;`_ to manage the installation.Install **geoh5py** from PyPI::    $ pip install geoh5pyFeedback^^^^^^^^Have comments or suggestions?
