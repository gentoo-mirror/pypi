	<longdescription># appel-crises-web## for developersOn first time,- Install `python3.7` if needed- Install `pre-commit` if needed (`pip install --user pre-commit`)- Install a python virtualenv manager if needed (`pip install --user vex`, `pip install --user pew`, ...)- Create a virtualenv (`vex --make appel-crises`, `pew new appel-crises`)- Install project dependencies: `make bootsrap` (or `pip install -e .[dev]` if make isn't available)- `cp local_settings.ini.template local_settings.ini` and edit `local_settings.ini`  if you need- if you chose postgresql DB, create user and database if needed- run `make build` to build static files- run `./manage.py migrate` to create DB tables- run `./manage.py createsuperuser` to create a local user## Dependencies managementDependencies are stored in `setup.cfg`:- Runtime dependencies are listed under `install_requires` in the `[options]` section;- Additional development dependencies are listed under `dev=` in the `[options.extras_require]`,  and installed alongside required dependencies by specifying the `[dev]` extra marker -  as seen in `pip install -e .[dev]`.## BuildingThe project is not composed only of pure Python code (it contains templates, images, ...).Some of those files must go through some processing before running in production:- Static files should be consolidated into a single tree, with hashed names and a manifest;- Message catalogs might need to be compiled to their final `.mo` form;- Some static data might be converted to some other formats for faster / easier loading.Those steps are controlled through the project wide `Makefile`, and should be calledthrough the `make build` (or simply `make`) command.That step is also executed when building a release.## ReleasingA release consists of a built project archive, under the `wheel` format; that package MUST include the result of a full compilation.</longdescription>
