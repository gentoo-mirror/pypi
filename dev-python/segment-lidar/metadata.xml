It brings together the power of the **Segment-Anything Model (SAM)** developed by [Meta Research](https://github.com/facebookresearch) and the **segment-geospatial** package from [Open Geospatial Solutions](https://github.com/opengeos). Whether you're a researcher, developer, or a geospatial enthusiast, segment-lidar opens up new possibilities for automatic processing of aerial LiDAR data and enables further applications. We encourage you to explore our code, contribute to its development and leverage its capabilities for your segmentation tasks.![results](https://github.com/Yarroudh/segment-lidar/assets/72500344/089a603b-697e-4483-af1e-3687a79adcc1)## InstallationWe recommand using `Python 3.9`. First, you need to install `PyTorch`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/).Then, you can easily install `segment-lidar` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/segment-lidar/):```bashpip install segment-lidar```Or, you can install it from source by running the following commands:```bashgit clone https://github.com/Yarroudh/segment-lidarcd segment-lidarpython setup.py install```Please, note that the actual version is always under tests. If you find any issues or bugs, please report them in [issues](https://github.com/Yarroudh/segment-lidar/issues) section. The second version should implement more advanced features and fonctionalities.## DocumentationIf you are using `segment-lidar`, we highly recommend that you take the time to read the [documentation](https://yarroudh.gitbook.io/segment-lidar/). The documentation is an essential resource that will help you understand the features of the package, as well as provide guidance on how to use it effectively.## Basic tutorialA basic tutorial is available [here](https://yarroudh.gitbook.io/segment-lidar/tutorial/basic-usage).You can also refer to API for more information about different parameters.### Without ground filtering```pythonfrom segment_lidar import samlidarmodel = samlidar.SamLidar(ckpt_path=&quot;sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth&quot;)points = model.read(&quot;pointcloud.las&quot;)labels, *_ = model.segment(points=points, image_path=&quot;raster.tif&quot;, labels_path=&quot;labeled.tif&quot;)model.write(points=points, segment_ids=labels, save_path=&quot;segmented.las&quot;)```### With ground filtering```pythonfrom segment_lidar import samlidarmodel = samlidar.SamLidar(ckpt_path=&quot;sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth&quot;)points = model.read(&quot;pointcloud.las&quot;)cloud, non_ground, ground = model.csf(points)labels, *_ = model.segment(points=cloud, image_path=&quot;raster.tif&quot;, labels_path=&quot;labeled.tif&quot;)model.write(points=points, non_ground=non_ground, ground=ground, segment_ids=labels, save_path=&quot;segmented.las&quot;)```## Sample dataFor testing purposes, you can download a sample here: [pointcloud.las](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16EF2aRSvo8u0pXvwtaQ6sjhP5h0sWw3o/view?usp=sharing).This data was retrieved from **AHN-4**.
