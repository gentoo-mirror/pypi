	<longdescription>Pytiff is a Python library for reading and writing large Tiff files. It supports tiled Tiffs and is able to read only a part of the image. While this is pytiffs main advantage, it also supports reading of many other image formats and writing of greyscale images in tile or scanline mode.</longdescription>
