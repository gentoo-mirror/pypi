	<longdescription>![Test](https://github.com/omercsp/taskrunner/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)# What is this?Taskrunner (henceforth, TR) allows users to run tasks with relation to the current working directory. Somewhat similar to VScode tasks, TR tasks are not bound to a specific platform and can be invoked from anywhere. A trivial environment for TR is a shell console, but any environment with ability to run executables is suitable.One can think of TR is as a commands repository for a directory or a way to enable dynamic PATH, where commands becomes available and unavailable according to the working directory.TR was written as a successor to `runevn`, a tool I wrote for running containers commands in similar manner which was extremely popular between myself and a guy I knew from work. `runenv` is great for sparing the user from remembering container settings for a given command, but is limited for a single task, isn't built for tasks that aren't container based and has limited features.# Why do I need it?Assume working on a project in a directory `project-dir`, where a long and complicated commands like: `my-command -vv --with-this-flags --and-this-flag=5 THIS_ARG AND_THIS_ARG` are often required. Remembering and repeating it can be be annoying and time consuming.One could rely on history, but commands history browsing can be as annoying as typing it. Besides, after a long period of time, the required entry it might not even be there, and if another user needs it, he need to figure it out by his own.Using shell script is a possible solution - place the logic in a script like `my-task.sh` and run it instead. This would work, of course, but now we need to remember `my-task.sh` and where it resides. Unless placed in the search PATH, it's not just a matter of of running `my-task` but `path/to/my-task`. And again, if a another user needs to run this command by herself, she has to have knowledge of this script in advance.An alias approach can also be tried: Alias `my-command-alias` to our command. Again, this works but suffers from drawbacks: you are either bound to have the `my-command` available in PATH or have the entire project pinned to a given directory. In addition, aliases are user level entities: A different user or placing the project in a different machine will require redefining the alias for that login. And once again - we need to know and remember what aliases are relevant - there's no way to differentiate between project and global aliases.The situation might get more complicated if other commands are needed as well - with other arguments, other working directories, maybe some environment variables, etc.With TR, all these problems are solved. All that is required is a project level configuration file defining a task named `my-task` to run the horrible `my-command...` and the command becomes available all over the project hierarchy, to all users with access to the project. `task list` can be used to see what tasks are available and `task info` to understand what they are doing. As long as TR is installed, moving the project to another machine will provide all the tasks with it.# Installation and requirementsTR is python based tool, verified for python 3.7 and above. Older versions might work as well, but are not actively supported and packaged so manuall install is required.To install run `pip3 install pytaskrunner`.For installation from source:1. Clone the repository2. Install the requirements using pip `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`3. Make sure the executable file `task` is accessible from to the execution search path (i.e. $PATH and so)TR should work for any environment with compatible python, however it is developed on and maintained for Linux machines. CI tests are ran for MacOS as well without container support. It is known to work on Cygwin systems (again, without containers support).# Basic configuration and usageTR uses json configuration files (By default, named `.tasks.json`) to describe tasks. These tasks are available when the current work directory is anywhere in the directory hierarchy under the directory the configuration file was placed in - TR recursively looks for `.tasks.json` from the current working directory up to root.Once set, use the following commands:1. Running tasks - by running `task run &lt;TASK&gt;`2. Getting info on a task - by running `task info &lt;TASK&gt;`3. Listing available tasks  - by running `task list`As implied, configuration files are json files. Each task is a json object with a name and a list of commands to execute.## Example - building projects[_source code projects are used in the following examples, but any sort of task is valid - `scp` some files, start a service through `systemctl`, open a video with `vlc`, etc._]:Assume a `cmake` based project in a directory named `cmake-project` with lots of sub directories. It might look something like this:```user@host $ tree cmake-project.├── build├── subdir0├── subdir1│   └── subdir3│       └── subdir4└── subdir5    └── subdir6```Often running basic `cmake` commands in such environments requires:1. Entering the project's `build` directory2. Running `cmake ..`Not very complicated, but can get tedious when actively developing cmake files all over the tree. By adding the following `.tasks.json` file into `cmake-project` directory, rerunning the relevant cmake command becomes trivial one-liner:```json{&quot;tasks&quot;: {&quot;cmake&quot;: {&quot;short_desc&quot;: &quot;Run cmake&quot;,&quot;description&quot;: &quot;Run 'cmake ..' for the cmake-project&quot;,&quot;commands&quot;: [&quot;cmake ..&quot;],&quot;cwd&quot;: &quot;{{taskRoot}}/build&quot;}}}```**Once set, running `task run cmake` from _anywhere_ under `cmake-project` will run the `cmake ..` with  `cmake-project/build` as the working directory**.In the tasks section our task, named `cmake` is defined:  - `short_desc` and `description` are for documentation and self-explanatory.  - `commands` sets a list of commands for this task to execute. In this case, a single `cmake ..` command is set.  - `cwd` sets the working directory for this task. Its commands are executed with this setting value as their working directory. The `{{taskRoot}}` is an automatic variable with the value of the location of the configuration file. Using it in `cwd` allows moving the project around without the need to update it. In our case, if the configuration file is placed in `cmake-project` root, say, `/home/user/projects/cmake-project`, the expanded value is  `/home/user/projects/cmake-project/build`.To list the available tasks, run `task list`:```user@host $ task listName                    Flags Description----                    ----- -----------cmake                         Run cmake```And for the task full details, run `task info cmake`, an a `-x` flag values expansion; in our case, the working directory:```user@host $ task info -x cmakeTask name:              cmakeShort description:      Run cmakeDescription:            Run 'cmake ..' for the cmake-projectHidden                  NoUse shell:              NoWorking directory:      /home/user/projects/cmake-project/buildCommand:                cmake ..```Now lets assume there's a need to occasionally run another task, similar to the one already defined. For example, with some `cmake` definition like `-DSOMEVAR=somevalue`. And another task that actually builds the project with `cmake --build .. -j8` , both, like the first task, need to be invoked from the `build` directory (Again, if you don't care about `cmake` and source building, don't worry about what each command does. Anything can be used here). Instead of remembering each command or placing these in shell scripts and then trying to remember where _they_ are, using TR tasks simplify the workflow:```json{&quot;tasks&quot;: {&quot;cmake&quot;: {&quot;short_desc&quot;: &quot;Run cmake&quot;,&quot;description&quot;: &quot;Run 'cmake ..' for the cmake-project&quot;,&quot;commands&quot;: [&quot;cmake ..&quot;],&quot;cwd&quot;: &quot;{{taskRoot}}/build&quot;},&quot;cmake-with-def&quot;: {&quot;short_desc&quot;: &quot;Run cmake with cmake define flag&quot;,&quot;description&quot;: &quot;Run 'cmake ..' for the cmake-project, with a cmake define flag&quot;,&quot;commands&quot;: [&quot;cmake -DSOMEVAR=somevalue ..&quot;],&quot;cwd&quot;: &quot;{{taskRoot}}/build&quot;},&quot;build&quot;: {&quot;short_desc&quot;: &quot;Build the project&quot;,&quot;description&quot;: &quot;Build the project using cmake's build command&quot;,&quot;commands&quot;: [&quot;cmake --build ..&quot;],&quot;cwd&quot;: &quot;{{taskRoot}}/build&quot;}}}```And now all commands are available, from any directory under `cmake-project`:```user@host $ task listName                    Flags Description----                    ----- -----------cmake                         Run cmakecmake-with-def                Run cmake with cmake define flagbuild                         Build the projectuser@host $ task info buildTask name:              buildShort description:      Build the projectDescription:            Build the project using cmake's build commandHidden:                 NoAbstract:               NoUse shell:              NoWorking directory:      {{taskRoot}}/buildCommand:                cmake --build ..user@host $ task run build...```The above example can be further simplified by using [variables](#variables) and [inheritance](#inheritance).## Multiple projects - same semantics, different detailsExtending the example above, assume multiple projects, each with its own way of doing things. Let's say (based on true events), that other than the notorious `cmake-project` we have 2 additional projects named `make-project` and `scons-project` (and `ninja-project` and `meson` project etc...).```user@host $ tree projectsprojects├── cmake-project├── make-project└── scons-project```As these new projects name imply, they are built around `make` and `scons` build systems so their build process them is different than our old `cmake-project` yet still we want to 'build' each one. We can try to remember each build command by our own and make sure we are in the correct project, or we can use TR: After adding a tasks file on each of these projects root directories each with its own `build` task, (like the `build` task exampled for `cmake-project`) the user can just run `task run build` in *any of these projects, and the correct build command will be invoked*. If her environment is consistent, she might add an alias like (Bash style) `alias build='task run build'` for even easier build - and whenever inside any of the source projects directories, running `build` invokes the correct command for the current project.# Advanced usageThis section will describe some of advanced configuration and usage topics. For a detailed list of all configuration settings, refer to the [configuration documentation](settings.md)## VariablesTR allows definitions of variables to be used through out the configuration.- Variables are evaluated as strings.- A variable `VAR` can be referred as `{{VAR}}`- Variables can be used in the following task properties: commands, environment variables, current working directory, container image, container working directory and container volumes.- A variable can be defined using other variablesThere are 3 types of variables with different priorities:1. Global variables - Defined in global level using `variables` as key word. They are available for every task with the scope of the tasks file.2. Task variables - Defined in task definitions level using `variables` as key word. They are available for the task they are defined in and those inherit from it. Inherited variables are overridden by the inheriting task variables. All task variables override global variables with the same name.3. System variables - set by TR and will override any variables with the same name. The following variables are defined:   - `cwd` - for the current working directory   - `taskRoot` - for the path of the directory the found configuration file was found. This is helpful when a task needs to refer to a directory relatively to the project (see previous examples for its usage).   - `cliArgs` - refers for arguments given by the user through CLI. See section about [passing command CLI arguments](#passing-command-line-arguments-to-commands)*TR auto variables override any user variable*, so avoid setting variables with reserved names.The following example show the different types of variables definition and usage.```json{&quot;variables&quot;: {&quot;ENV_NAME&quot;: &quot;global_env_name&quot;,&quot;ENV_VALUE&quot;: &quot;global_env_value&quot;,&quot;var0&quot;: &quot;global_var0_value&quot;,&quot;var1&quot;: &quot;global_var1_value&quot;},&quot;tasks&quot;: {&quot;task0&quot;: {&quot;variables&quot;: {&quot;var1&quot;: &quot;task0_var1_value&quot;,&quot;var2&quot;: &quot;task0_var2_value&quot;},&quot;env&quot;: {&quot;{{ENV_NAME}}&quot;: &quot;{{ENV_VALUE}}&quot;},&quot;commands&quot;: [&quot;printenv {{ENV_NAME}}&quot;,&quot;echo {{var0}}&quot;,&quot;echo {{var1}}&quot;,&quot;echo {{var2}}&quot;]},&quot;task1&quot;: {&quot;base&quot;: &quot;task0&quot;,&quot;variables&quot;: {&quot;ENV_VALUE&quot;: &quot;task1_env_value&quot;,&quot;var2&quot;: &quot;task1_var2_value&quot;},&quot;env&quot;: {&quot;{{ENV_NAME}}&quot;: &quot;{{ENV_VALUE}}&quot;}}}}```In the above example, a few global vars are defined. `task0` overrides the global `var1` and sets its own `var2`. `task1` overrides the inherited `task0` `var2`. Note the environment variable setting using the TR variables.See the [inheritance section](#Inheritance) for more deatils about task inheritance.### Environment variablesEnvironment variables can be referred with `{{$VAR}}`, where `VAR` is the variable name. Environment variables can be used whereever TR variables can be used. Note the difference between environment variables used in the task setting and environment variables that are set for a given task using the `env` keyword.When a task is invoked its commands are invoked with the current set of system environment variables merged with task specific variables if such exist either from the task configuration or from CLI. Task variables take precedence over system variables. This behavior can be modified by setting the task's `env_inherit`. Set to `false`, TR ignores the system environment variables, and passes the task commands only the task environment variables. By default `env_inherit` is set to `true`.## Container based tasksTR includes special support for running tasks inside a container. The main container setting is `c_image` defining a container image to use. The following task runs `make` inside a container with a volume, CWD set, tty allocated, interactive mode, wrapped in a `/usr/bin/sh -c`:```json&quot;build&quot;: {&quot;short_desc&quot;: &quot;Build&quot;,&quot;c_image&quot;: &quot;localhost/media-builder:latest&quot;,&quot;c_volumes&quot;: [&quot;{cwd}:{cwd}&quot;],&quot;c_tty&quot;: true,&quot;c_interactive&quot;: true,&quot;c_shell&quot;: true,&quot;c_cwd&quot;: &quot;{{taskRoot}}&quot;&quot;commands&quot;: [&quot;ls -l&quot;],},```The actual command the task invokes is `/usr/bin/docker -i -t --rm -w {{taskRoot}} -v {{cwd}}:{{cwd}} localhost/media-builder:latest /usr/bin/sh -c &quot;ls -l&quot;`.Container support is synthetic sugar, and putting the complete container command as a `commands` entry instead of setting a task container settings is completely valid and equivalent for having TR assemble the command instead, but usually it's much easier to let TR handle these settings.For a detailed list of all container configuration settings, refer to the [configuration documentation](settings.md).## InheritanceA task might inherit another task settings by using the `base` settings. If task `a` inherits task `b`, all of `b`'s settings are inherited. Setting redefined in task `a` will override inherited setting. The following example demonstrates how to utilize task inheritance for creating multiple tasks with similar characteristics that differ in a small details (working directory):```json{&quot;tasks&quot;: {&quot;base-task&quot;: {&quot;abstract&quot;: true,&quot;commands&quot;: [&quot;very_complicated command --with --lots=of --flags and arguments&quot;],&quot;env&quot;: {&quot;and&quot;: &quot;some&quot;,&quot;environment&quot;: &quot;variables&quot;}},&quot;task-1&quot;: {&quot;base&quot;: &quot;base-task&quot;,&quot;cwd&quot;: &quot;/opt/task-1_dir&quot;},&quot;task-2&quot;: {&quot;base&quot;: &quot;base-task&quot;,&quot;cwd&quot;: &quot;/opt/task-2_dir&quot;}}}```## Configuration files inclusionEvery configuration file can include multiple files using a global `include` setting. Global settings, variables and tasks are all included and overridden if exist in a following include file, and finally in the original configuration file.A special file located in `${HOME}/.config/tasks.json` is always included if it exists. This behavior can be disabled by setting `use_default_include` to `false`.### Passing command line arguments to commandsCommand line arguments are transferred to a task run with the `--` convention: text written after the 'dash dash' token is transferred as an arguments. The arguments aren't passed to the commands automatically. In order for a command to use CLI arguments, it must be explicitly use it with the `{{cliArgs}}` variable. The allows fine grain control of which commands and where inside the command the CLI arguments are used. In fact, since arguments are translates to a TR variable, `{{cliArgs}}` can be used in every setting with variables support.Running `task run ls -- -l somefile.txt` in the following task will run `ls -l somefile.txt`:```json&quot;ls&quot;: {&quot;commands&quot;: [&quot;ls {{cliArgs}}&quot;],&quot;short_desc&quot;: &quot;Clean build&quot;}```## TR CLI optionsTR allows overriding almost any configuration setting using the CLI. In general these should be avoided unless debugging or tweaking a task temporarily. For example, if one wants to run a task but just tweak the command it runs (retaining other settings like container settings, environment variable, etc.), running `task run -c &quot;my new command&quot; &lt;TASK&gt;` will do the trick.Run `task -h` and `task &lt;CMD&gt; -h` for the full list of CLI options.## Bash completionTR uses `argcomplete` for bash auto complete. See `argcomplete` documentation for more details.## LoggingTR Logging can be enabled with the `--log_file &lt;FILE&gt;` CLI option. Use `-v` to increase its verbosity.# StatusWhile tested and works, TR is still a work in progress. Breaking changes are expected. Version and schema validations will issue error messages if incompatibility is detected.</longdescription>
