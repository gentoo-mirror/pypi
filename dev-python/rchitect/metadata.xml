Speaking of compatibility, `rchitect` has been thoroughly tested onmultiple platforms such as Windows, macOS and Linux and we also provide binarywheels for python 2.7 and 3.5+.## Getting started```pyfrom rchitect import *a = reval(&quot;1:5&quot;)     # evaluate an R expression in the global environmentb = rcopy(a)         # convert any RObject returned by `reval` to its python typec = robject(b)       # convert any python object to its R typed = rcall(&quot;sum&quot;, c)  # call an R function. Python objects are converted to RObjects implicitly.```## FAQ#### How to switch to a different R or specify the version of R.There are a few options.- One could expose the path to the R binary in the `PATH` variable- The environment variable `R_BINARY` could also be used to specify the path to R.- The environment variable `R_HOME` could also be used to specify R home directory. Note that it is should be set as the result of `R.home()`, not the directory where `R` is located. For example, in Unix```sh$ env R_HOME=/usr/local/lib/R radian```#### Cannot find shared libraryPlease also make sure that R was installed with the R shared library `libR.so` or `libR.dylib` or `libR.dll`. On Linux, the flag `--enable-R-shlib` may be needed to install R from the source.## Wiki[reticulate](https://github.com/randy3k/rchitect/wiki/Conversions-between-reticulate-and-rchitect-objects-are-seamless) conversions</longdescription>
