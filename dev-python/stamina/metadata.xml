If [*prometheus-client*](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python) is installed, retries are counted using the *Prometheus* counter `stamina_retries_total`.  If [*structlog*](https://www.structlog.org/) is installed, they are logged using a *structlog* logger at warning level.  These two instrumentations are *independent* from each other.## License*stamina* is written by [Hynek Schlawack](https://hynek.me/) and distributed under the terms of the [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) license.</longdescription>
