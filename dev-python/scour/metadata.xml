	<longdescription>Scour is an SVG optimizer/cleaner that reduces the size of scalablevector graphics by optimizing structure and removing unnecessary data.It can be used to create streamlined vector graphics suitable for webdeployment, publishing/sharing or further processing.The goal of Scour is to output a file that renderes identically at afraction of the size by removing a lot of redundant information createdby most SVG editors. Optimization options are typically lossless but canbe tweaked for more agressive cleaning.Website  - http://www.codedread.com/scour/ (original website)  - https://github.com/scour-project/scour (today)Authors:  - Jeff Schiller, Louis Simard (original authors)  - Tobias Oberstein (maintainer)  - Patrick Storz (maintainer)</longdescription>
