	<longdescription>*********find2deny*********Tools to build Firewall Command for UFW from List of (Apache)-Log-files.It creates a file `block-ip.sh` which contains Linux UWF-Command to block IP-network, but itdoes not change any Firewall-rules on your computer.Installation============To install the latest release on `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/find2deny/&gt;`_,simply run:::  pip install find2denyOr to install the latest development version, run:::  git clone [TODO]  cd find2deny  python setup.py installQuick Tutorial==============For example, you have a set of Apache Log-files in a directory ``apache2`` like* ``access.log``* ``access.log.1``,* ``access.log.2.gz``,* ...The python script ``find2deny-cli`` can create a shell-Script ``block-ip.sh`` which contains commands like::    #!/bin/bash    ufw deny from 1.2.3.4/0 to any    ufw deny from 1.2.3.4/1 to any    ...1. Make a Configuration-File: Simple copy this configuration to a file, say ``config.toml``::        verbosity = &quot;INFO&quot;        # Path to apache log files in system        log_files = [&quot;apache2/access.log.*&quot;]        # Log Pattern        log_pattern = '%h %l %u %t &quot;%r&quot; %&gt;s %O &quot;%{Referer}i&quot; &quot;%{User-Agent}i&quot;'        # temporary sqlite database        database_path=&quot;./blocked-ip.sqlite&quot;        [[judgment]]            name = &quot;path-based-judgment&quot;            [judgment.rules]                bot_request = [                    &quot;/?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=phpstorm&quot;,                    &quot;/phpMyAdmin/&quot;,                    &quot;/pma/&quot;,                    &quot;/myadmin/&quot;,                    &quot;/MyAdmin/&quot;,                    &quot;/mahua/&quot;,                    &quot;/wp-login&quot;,                    &quot;/webdav/&quot;,                    &quot;/help.php&quot;,                    &quot;/java.php&quot;,                    &quot;/db_pma.php&quot;,                    &quot;/logon.php&quot;,                    &quot;/help-e.php&quot;,                    &quot;/hell.php&quot;,                    &quot;/defect.php&quot;,                    &quot;/webslee.php&quot;,                    &quot;http://www.123cha.com/&quot;,                    &quot;http://www.wujieliulan.com/&quot;,                    &quot;http://www.epochtimes.com/&quot;,                    &quot;http://www.ip.cn/&quot;,                    &quot;www.baidu.com:443&quot;                ]        [[judgment]]            name = &quot;time-based-judgment&quot;            [judgment.rules]                max_request = 501                interval_seconds = 10        [[execution]]            name = &quot;ufw_cmd_script&quot;            [execution.rules]                script = &quot;./block-ip.sh&quot;2. Run script::        find2deny-init-db blocked-ip.sqlite   to create a Sqlite-Database in file ``blocked-ip.sqlite``. The filename must match the configuration   ``database_path`` in the file ``config.toml``.3. Run::        find2deny-cli config.toml   to create file ``block-ip.sh``. Then you can examinate the file ``block-ip.sh`` and run it from your shell   to update your firewall.Configuration=============The syntax used in configuration file ist `Toml &lt;https://github.com/toml-lang/toml&gt;`_. There are threesections in a configuration files, as you see aboveCommon Configuration--------------------This section defines common configurations, such as how much infos should be printed onto console, ect.Judgment--------This section defines a list of Judgments. They are identified by name. At this time there are only twojudments: ``path-based-judgment`` and ``time-based-judgment``. Each judgment has its owns configuration.Judgments are classes, which use rules defined in configuration to decide which IPs should be blocked.They extend the class ``AbstractIpJudgment``.Execution---------This section defines a list of executions. At this time there is only one execution. Executions are classeswhich create firewall-rules or execute something, which nessesary to block an IP, or , in this implementation,block the network, to which the ip belongs.</longdescription>
