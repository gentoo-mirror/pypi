	<longdescription>django-uuid-upload-path=======================**django-uuid-upload-path** generates short UUIDs to use as paths for uploaded media files in Django.Features---------  Generate short (22 character), URL-safe base64-encoded UUIDs.-  Upload media files to short UUID filenames.Installation------------1. Checkout the latest django-uuid-upload-path release and copy or symlink the   ``uuid_upload_path`` directory into your ``PYTHONPATH``.  If using pip, run    ``pip install django-uuid-upload-path``.Generating short UUIDs----------------------Generate a short, URL-safe UUID as follows:::    from uuid_upload_path import uuid    uuid()  // -&gt; &quot;hCdLEjlQQJW25-sXB3T_Gw&quot;Generating upload paths-----------------------To upload media files to short UUID filenames, just set `upload_to` to `uuid_upload_path.upload_to`.::    from uuid_upload_path import upload_to    class YourModel(models.Model):        file = models.FileField(            upload_to = upload_to,        )Why use UUIDs as upload paths?------------------------------Django tries to ensure that all your uploaded files are given unique names on the filesystem. It does this by checking if a file with the same name exists before saving a new one, and adding a suffix if the new file would otherwise conflict with the existing one.If you're saving files to disk using the built-in ``django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage``, this isn't much of a problem. However, if you're using a cloud file storage, such as ``storages.backends.s3boto.S3BotoStorage``, this uniqueness check can have a noticeable effect on the performance of file uploads. Worse, the default configuration of `S3BotoStorage` is to overwrite existing files with the same name when uploading a new file!By generating a unique filename for each uploaded file, django-uuid-upload-path removes the need for a costly uniqueness check, and avoids accidentally overwriting existing files on remote cloud storages.Support and announcements-------------------------Downloads and bug tracking can be found at the `main projectwebsite &lt;http://github.com/etianen/django-uuid-upload-path&gt;`_.More information----------------The django-uuid-upload-path project was developed by Dave Hall.
