This approach allows us to interactwith files independently of the underlying file system, using a common set of operatorsfor performing general operations such as copying and deleting files.Currently, airflow-fs supports the following file systems: local, FTP, HDFS, S3 and SFTP.Support for additional file systems can be added by implementing an additional filesystem hook that adheres to the required hook interface. See the documentation for moredetails.Documentation-------------Detailed documentation is available at: https://jrderuiter.github.io/airflow-fs.License-------This software is freely available under the MIT license.=======History=======Version 0.1.0-------------Initial release supporting local, FTP, HDFS, S3 and SFTP file systems.</longdescription>
