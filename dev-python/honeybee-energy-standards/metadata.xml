	<longdescription>[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-energy-standards.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-energy-standards)[![Python 2.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-2.7-green.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-270/) [![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)# honeybee-energy-standardsHoneybee-energy extension for standards, codes, and templates.All of the data that this module adds to the [honeybee-energy](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-energy).lib comes from the[OpenStudio Standards Gem](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-standards) and the master[Google Sheets files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x7yEU4jnKw-gskLBih8IopStwl0KAMEi)that possess all of the most recent data. The original sources of this data include the following:* The US Department of Energy [Commercial Reference Buildings](https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/commercial-reference-buildings).* The [ASHRAE Standard 90.1](https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/bookstore/standard-90-1) including all versions from 2004 to the present.* The [Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS)](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/), specifically for any templates before ASHRAE Standard 90.1 2004.## Installation```consolepip install honeybee-energy-standards```## QuickStart```pythonimport honeybee_energy_standards```## [API Documentation](http://ladybug-tools.github.io/honeybee-energy-standards/docs)## Local Development1. Clone this repo locally```consolegit clone git@github.com:ladybug-tools/honeybee-energy-standards# orgit clone https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-energy-standards```2. Install dependencies:```consolecd honeybee-energy-standardspip install -r dev-requirements.txt```3. Run Tests:```consolepython -m pytest tests/```4. Re-generate the Data from the [OpenStudio Standards Gem](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-standards)(or to update the JSONs based on changes to the honeybee schema)```pythonfrom standards_update._util._all import clean_all, remove_allfrom standards_update._util._to_honeybee import convert_to_hb_json, remove_hb_jsonsremove_hb_jsons()  # remove all of the honeybee JSON data that currently exists# generate clean OpenStudio Standards Data JSONs from the gemashrae_standards = 'C:/Users/chris/Documents/GitHub/nrel/openstudio-standards/lib/' \    'openstudio-standards/standards/ashrae_90_1/'clean_all(ashrae_standards)# change the package to load all data from the clean Standards Gem JSONsimport standards_update._change_to_standards_dataconvert_to_hb_json()  # generate Honeybee JSONs from the clean Standards Gem JSONsremove_all()  # remove all of the clean Standards Gem JSONs now that they're converted```The resulting JSON data will be output to the data folder such that it can bechecked before copying it into honeybee_energy_standards.## Note to developers using this repo as an exampleDevelopers may use this repository and Python package as a template to create theirown extensions for the library of standards accessible to honeybee_energy. For suchdevelopers, it is important to know the rules that must be followed to have asuccessful honeybee energy standards extension. First, any honeybee energy standardsextension must have a package name the starts with `honeybee_energy` and endswith `standards` (all words in between are up to the user, barring spaces andspecial characters).Second, the following folders *MUST* be included in any honeybee energy standardsextension:* `constructions`* `constructionsets`* `schedules`* `programtypes`The following rules must be followed:* All JSONs must use the [Honeybee Model Schema](https://www.ladybug.tools/honeybee-schema/model.html)    representation of objects and must be formatted with the name of the object as keys    and the schema definition of the object as values.* The `constructions` sub-folder should contain the following files: `opaque_material.json`,    `opaque_construction.json`, `window_material.json`, `window_constructions.json`.    These files should possess objects that match their names.* The `schedules` sub-folder should have all schedules in a `schedule.json` file.* The `constructionsets` and `programtypes` folder can possess any number of JSON    files with their respective objects.* Any objects that make up larger objects must be present. For example, all of the    constructions that make up the objects in `constructionsets` must be found in the    `constructions` sub-folder.</longdescription>
