	<longdescription>Preprocessing of functional MRI (fMRI) involves numerous steps to clean and standardizethe data before statistical analysis.Generally, researchers create ad hoc preprocessing workflows for each dataset,building upon a large inventory of available tools.The complexity of these workflows has snowballed with rapid advances inacquisition and processing.fMRIPrep is an analysis-agnostic tool that addresses the challenge of robust andreproducible preprocessing for task-based and resting fMRI data.fMRIPrep automatically adapts a best-in-breed workflow to the idiosyncrasies ofvirtually any dataset, ensuring high-quality preprocessing without manual intervention.fMRIPrep robustly produces high-quality results on diverse fMRI data.Additionally, fMRIPrep introduces less uncontrolled spatial smoothness than observedwith commonly used preprocessing tools.fMRIPrep equips neuroscientists with an easy-to-use and transparent preprocessingworkflow, which can help ensure the validity of inference and the interpretabilityof results.The workflow is based on `Nipype &lt;https://nipype.readthedocs.io&gt;`_ and encompasses a largeset of tools from well-known neuroimaging packages, including`FSL &lt;https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/&gt;`_,`ANTs &lt;https://stnava.github.io/ANTs/&gt;`_,`FreeSurfer &lt;https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/&gt;`_,`AFNI &lt;https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/&gt;`_,and `Nilearn &lt;https://nilearn.github.io/&gt;`_.This pipeline was designed to provide the best software implementation for each state ofpreprocessing, and will be updated as newer and better neuroimaging software becomesavailable.fMRIPrep performs basic preprocessing steps (coregistration, normalization, unwarping, noisecomponent extraction, segmentation, skullstripping etc.) providing outputs that can beeasily submitted to a variety of group level analyses, including task-based or resting-statefMRI, graph theory measures, surface or volume-based statistics, etc.fMRIPrep allows you to easily do the following:  * Take fMRI data from *unprocessed* (only reconstructed) to ready for analysis.  * Implement tools from different software packages.  * Achieve optimal data processing quality by using the best tools available.  * Generate preprocessing-assessment reports, with which the user can easily identify problems.  * Receive verbose output concerning the stage of preprocessing for each subject, including    meaningful errors.  * Automate and parallelize processing steps, which provides a significant speed-up from    typical linear, manual processing.[Nat Meth doi:`10.1038/s41592-018-0235-4 &lt;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0235-4&gt;`_][Documentation `fmriprep.org &lt;https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io&gt;`_][Software doi:`10.5281/zenodo.852659 &lt;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.852659&gt;`_][Support `neurostars.org &lt;https://neurostars.org/tags/fmriprep&gt;`_]License information-------------------*fMRIPrep* adheres to the`general licensing guidelines &lt;https://www.nipreps.org/community/licensing/&gt;`__of the *NiPreps framework*.License~~~~~~~Copyright (c) 2023, the *NiPreps* Developers.As of the 21.0.x pre-release and release series, *fMRIPrep* islicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;);you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.You may obtain a copy of the License at`http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&lt;http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&gt;`__.Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, softwaredistributed under the License is distributed on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.See the License for the specific language governing permissions andlimitations under the License.</longdescription>
