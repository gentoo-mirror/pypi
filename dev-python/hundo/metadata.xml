	<longdescription>|DOI| |Documentation Status| |bioconda-badge|-  Performs quality control based on quality, can trim adapters, and   remove sequences matching a contaminant database-  Handles paired-end read merging-  Integrates *de novo* and reference-based chimera filtering-  Clusters sequences and annotates using databases that are downloaded   as needed-  Generates standard outputs for these data like a newick tree, a   tabular OTU table with taxonomy, and .biom.This workflow is built using`Snakemake &lt;https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&gt;`__ and makesuse of `Bioconda &lt;https://bioconda.github.io/&gt;`__ to install itsdependencies.Documentation=============For complete documentation and install instructions, see:https://hundo.readthedocs.ioInstall=======This protocol leverages the work of Bioconda and depends on ``conda``.For complete setup of these, please see:https://bioconda.github.io/#using-biocondaReally, you just need to make sure ``conda`` is executable and you'veset up your channels (numbers 1 and 2). Then:::    conda install python&gt;=3.6 click \        pyyaml snakemake&gt;=5.1.4 biopython    pip install hundoUsage=====Running samples through annotation requires that input FASTQs bepaired-end, named in a semi-conventional style starting sample ID,contain &quot;\_R1&quot; (or &quot;\_r1&quot;) and &quot;\_R2&quot; (or &quot;\_r2&quot;) index identifiers, andhave an extension &quot;.fastq&quot; or &quot;.fq&quot;. The files may be gzipped and endwith &quot;.gz&quot;. By default, both R1 and R2 need to be larger than 10K insize. This cutoff is arbitrary and can be set using``--prefilter-file-size``.Using the example data of the mothur SOP located in our tests directory,we can annotate across SILVA using:::    cd example    hundo annotate \        --filter-adapters qc_references/adapters.fa.gz \        --filter-contaminants qc_references/phix174.fa.gz \        --out-dir mothur_sop_silva \        --database-dir annotation_references \        --reference-database silva \        mothur_sop_dataDependencies are installed by default in the results directory definedon the command line as ``--out-dir``. If you want to re-use dependenciesacross many analyses and not have to re-install each time you update theoutput directory, use Snakemake's ``--conda-prefix``:::    hundo annotate \        --out-dir mothur_sop_silva \        --database-dir annotation_references \        --reference-database silva \        mothur_sop_data \        --conda-prefix /Users/brow015/devel/hundo/example/condaOutput======**OTU.biom**Biom table with raw counts per sample and their associated taxonomicassignment formatted to be compatible with downstream tools likephyloseq.**OTU.fasta**Representative DNA sequences of each OTU.**OTU.tree**Newick tree representation of aligned OTU sequences.**OTU.txt**Tab-delimited text table with columns OTU ID, a column for each sample,and taxonomy assignment in the final column as a comma delimited list.**OTU\_aligned.fasta**OTU sequences after alignment using Clustal Omega.**all-sequences.fasta**Quality-controlled, dereplicated DNA sequences of all samples. Theheader of each record identifies the sample of origin and the countresulting from dereplication.**blast-hits.txt**The BLAST assignments per OTU sequence.**summary.html**Captures and summarizes data of the experimental dataset. Things likesequence quality, counts per sample at varying stages of pre-processing, andsummarized taxonomic composition per sample across phylum, class, andorder.Citing======Cite this as:    Brown J, Zavoshy N, Brislawn CJ, McCue LA.
