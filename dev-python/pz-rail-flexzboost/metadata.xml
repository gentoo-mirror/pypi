Unfortunately the RAIL projecttemplate can not do these for you, otherwise it would :) ### Immediate actions- In your repository settings:  -  Grant the `LSSTDESC/rail_admin` group administrator access  -  Grant the `LSSTDESC/photo-z` group maintainer access- Configure Codecov for the repository  - Go here, https://github.com/apps/codecov, click the &quot;Configure&quot; button- Log in to PyPI.org and configure Trusted Publishing following these instructions https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/creating-a-project-through-oidc/- Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) to automatically add issues to the RAIL project tracker  - Follow these instruction to create a PAT: https://github.com/actions/add-to-project#creating-a-pat-and-adding-it-to-your-repository   - Save your new PAT as a repository secret named `ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT`### Before including in Rail-hub- Make sure your `main` branch is protected- Update this README- Create an example notebook- Run `pylint` on your code- Remove this TODO list once all items are completed## RAIL: Redshift Assessment Infrastructure LayersThis package is part of the larger ecosystem of Photometric Redshiftsin [RAIL](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL).### Citing RAILThis code, while public on GitHub, has not yet been released by DESC and isstill under active development.
