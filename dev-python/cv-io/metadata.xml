	<longdescription># Computer Vision I/OThis python package, Computer Vision I/O which is knwon as **_cv\_io_**, is a collection of existing python scripts which provides a set of I/O functions for normal and irregular image formats in computer vision.## File Format SupportFile format | Desciption------------|-------------*.png, *.jpg, ... | All normal images*.flo | Middleburry optical flow*.dpt | Middleburry floating point depth*.pfm | Freiburg floating point disparity*.exr | OpenXR hdr format*.jxr | MicroSoft JPEG-XR hdr format## Main FucntionsFunction | Desciption---------|------------imread (file\_name) | Reads an image from &quot;file\_name&quot;imwrite (file\_name, image) | Saves the &quot;image&quot; array to &quot;file\_name&quot;imshow (image) | Displays the &quot;image&quot; array by matplotlibimshow (file\_name) | Displays an image file from &quot;file\_name&quot;## RequirementsPackage requirement are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file and it will be installed through `pip` isntallation. If you clone the repository you may install requirements manually:```shellpip install -r requirements.txt```***# Install as a Python PackageYou can also download and install the **Simple Image Viewer** as a python package by:```python -m pip install cv_io```or simply ```pip install cv_io```Then you can simply import it in a python code and use it as follows:```pythonimport cv_ioimage = cv_io.imread('samples/0512.pfm')cv_io.imshow(image)cv_io.imwrite('test.pfm', image)```You also have acess to the original libraries like `sintel_io` through the `cv_io` as a sub-module: ```pythonimport cv_ioimage = cv_io.sintel_io.depth_read ('samples/frame_0020.dpt')cv_io.sintel_io.depth_write('test.dpt', image)```***_Copyright &amp;copy; 2020 [Saeid Hosseinipoor](https://saeid-h.github.io/).
