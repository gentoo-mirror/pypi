	<longdescription># jupyter_bokeh![Github Actions Status](https://github.com/bokeh/jupyter_bokeh/workflows/Build/badge.svg)A Jupyter extension for rendering [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org) content within Jupyter.  See also the separate [ipywidgets_bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/ipywidgets_bokeh) library for support for using Jupyter widgets/ipywidgets objects within Bokeh applications.## InstallFor versions 3.0 and newer of JupyterLab, you have the option to installjupyter_bokeh with either ``pip`` or ``conda``:```bashpip install jupyter_bokeh```or```bashconda install -c conda-forge jupyter_bokeh```For versions of Jupyter Lab older than 3.0, you must install the labextensionseparately:```bashconda install -c conda-forge jupyter_bokehjupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-managerjupyter labextension install @bokeh/jupyter_bokeh```To install a specific version:```bashjupyter labextension install @bokeh/jupyter_bokeh@x.y.x```## CompatibilityThe core [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) library is generally version independent of[JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) and this ``jupyter_bokeh`` extensionfor versions of ``bokeh&gt;=2.0.0``.Our goal is that ``jupyter_bokeh`` minor releases (using the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) pattern) aremade to follow JupyterLab minor release bumps, while micro releases are for new ``jupyter_bokeh`` featuresor bug fix releases. We've been previously inconsistent with having the extension release minor version bumpstrack that of JupyterLab, so users seeking to find extension releases that are compatible with their JupyterLabinstallation may refer to the below table.###### Compatible JupyterLab and `jupyter_bokeh` versions| JupyterLab    | `jupyter_bokeh`  || ------------- | ---------------- || 0.34.x        | 0.6.2            || 0.35.x        | 0.6.3            || 1.0.x         | 1.0.0            || 2.0.x         | 2.0.0            || 3.0.x         | 3.0.0            |## Contributing### Development installNote: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.```bash# Clone the repo to your local environment# Change directory to the jupyter_bokeh directory# Install package in development modepip install -e .# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLabjupyter labextension develop . --overwrite# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changesjlpm run build```You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.```bash# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when neededjlpm run watch# Run JupyterLab in another terminaljupyter lab```With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).By default, the `jlpm run build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:```bashjupyter lab build --minimize=False```### Uninstall```bashpip uninstall jupyter_bokeh```</longdescription>
