	<longdescription># Note:This version of the library is built off of my (@ksunden) personal github fork of the picosdk repo.I am distributing via PyPI as permitted under the terms of the ISC license.I do not intend to make any changes to the actual library, only to the packaging (e.g. using setuptools, changing the version number for releases).If a representative of PicoTech contacts me, I will gladly transfer ownership of the PyPI namespace to the company.# picosdk-python-wrappersWelcome to the PicoSDK for Python. It allows you to control PicoScope devices in your own Python programs.## Getting startedTo use this code you will need to install the PicoSDK C libraries.### Microsoft WindowsPlease visit [our Downloads page](https://www.picotech.com/downloads) to download the 32-bit or 64-bit PicoSDK C Libraries for Windows. Please take care to match the &quot;bitness&quot; of your python to the PicoSDK.### LinuxFollow the instructions from our [Linux Software &amp; Drivers for Oscilloscopes and Data Loggers page](https://www.picotech.com/downloads/linux) to install the required driver packages for your product.### macOSmacOS users should install PicoScope Beta for macOS, and then may find this [forum post](https://www.picotech.com/support/topic22221.html) helpful for installing the C libraries.## Installing the python driver bindingsA `distutils` installer is provided. After you have installed the PicoSDKdriver package (see above), the Python installer can be used as follows:    python setup.py installOn macOS and Linux you will either need to use `sudo` with this command, toinstall into the system folders, or to install for the current user only youcan use:    python setup.py install --userWithin python, the library for `import` is called `picosdk`.## CompatibilityThis code is written to be compatible with both python 2.7 and python 3 (any version).If you find a compatibility problem please raise an [Issue](https://www.picotech.com/tech-support), listing all the versions you can find (python, numpy, picosdk commit hash, etc.) and your error message(s).## C interfaceYou can access C driver functions directly (ctypes calls) by their original C name, following the [Programmer'sGuides](https://github.com/picotech/picosdk-python-wrappers#programmers-guides) exactly. Examples are provided in the folders like `psX000[a]Examples/`.### Programmer's GuidesYou can download Programmer's Guides providing a description of the API functions for the relevant PicoScope or PicoLog driver from our [Documentation page](https://www.picotech.com/library/documentation).## Python interfaceWe are in the process of adding Pythonic wrappers around the C functions. If we haven't got to your feature yet or your device is listed as one of the [unsupported models](https://github.com/picotech/picosdk-python-wrappers#unsupported-models),let us know that you're waiting in an [Issue](https://www.picotech.com/tech-support)### Unsupported modelsThe following drivers and devices are not yet supported:* `plcm3` - PicoLog CM3 Current Data Logger* `ps3000` - PicoScope 3204, 3205, 3206, 3223, 3224, 3423 &amp; 3423* `usbpt104` - PT-104 Platinum Resistance Data Logger### DependenciesAs well as depending on the C libraries, the Pythonic wrappers use some python libraries like `numpy`. Many of theexamples scripts also use the `matplotlib` plotting library. You can install these dependencies with pip as follows:    pip install -r requirements.txt    pip install -r requirements-for-examples.txt### Driver-agnostic examplesThe `anyScopeExamples` folder contains examples in pure python which do the same thing as the C-style examples, butin a driver-generic way.### Python Classes#### Library`picosdk.library.Library` contains a base class for each of the driver classes. It does the job of translating pythontypes into C ones, and back again, and some unit conversions to get rid of nano, micro and milli-style prefixes. It alsohandles any differences in programming API between PicoScope driver versions.#### Device`picosdk.device.Device` contains the concrete class which represents a PicoScope with a valid handle. It caches someinformation about the device state, like the currently selected voltage ranges of the channels.It is implemented in terms of the Library class' public interface, and deals almost entirely with python types. Themain exception is its handling of numpy arrays - it (knowing the voltage ranges) is responsible for converting the rawADC counts that the driver uses for amplitude into physical units.## Testing this codeCheck which device driver your device uses, and check the constants at the top of test/test_helpers.py to enable the relevant drivers for connected-device tests. (most tests use this).To check which driver your device uses, you can use `picosdk.discover`:    from picosdk.discover import find_all_units        scopes = find_all_units()        for scope in scopes:        print(scope.info)        scope.close()You should then configure test/test_helpers.py's list of connected devices, so it can run all the tests we haveon your device.To run the unit tests, you will need to install nose (e.g. `pip install nose`.) Then, run `nosetests` in the root of the repo. ## Obtaining supportPlease visit our [Support page](https://www.picotech.com/tech-support) to contact us directly or visit our [Test and Measurement Forum](https://www.picotech.com/support/forum17.html) to post questions.## Copyright and licensingSee [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for license terms. *PicoScope*, *PicoLog* and *PicoSDK* are registered trademarks of Pico Technology Ltd. *Windows* is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation. *macOS* is a registered trademark of Apple Inc. *Linux* is the registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and other countries.Copyright Â© 2018-2019 Pico Technology Ltd.
