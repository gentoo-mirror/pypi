In doubt, refer to tested code and scripts: basic functions of lstchain (reduction steps R0--&gt;DL1 and DL1--&gt;DL2) are unit tested and should be working as long as the build status is passing.## Install- You will need to install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (recommended) or [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) first. ### As user```LSTCHAIN_VER=0.9.6  (or the version you want to install - usually the latest release)wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cta-observatory/cta-lstchain/v$LSTCHAIN_VER/environment.ymlconda env create -n lst -f environment.ymlconda activate lstpip install lstchain==$LSTCHAIN_VERrm environment.yml```### As developer- Create and activate the conda environment:```git clone https://github.com/cta-observatory/cta-lstchain.gitcd cta-lstchainconda env create -f environment.ymlconda activate lst-dev```**Note**: To prevent packages you installed with `pip install --user` from taking precedence over the conda environment, run:```conda env config vars set PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 -n &lt;environment_name&gt;```To update the environment (e.g. when depenencies got updated), use:```conda env update -n lst-dev -f environment.yml```- Install lstchain in developer mode:```pip install -e .```To run some of the tests, some non-public test data files are needed.These tests will not be run locally if the test data is not available,but are always run in the CI.To download the test files locally, run `./download_test_data.sh`.It will ask for username and password and requires `wget` to be installed.Ask one of the project maintainers for the credentials. If you are a member of the LST collaboration you can also obtain them here:https://ctaoobservatory.sharepoint.com/:i:/r/sites/ctan-onsite-it/Shared%20Documents/General/information_2.jpg?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=suUkV6To run the tests that need those private data file, add `-m private_data`to the pytest call, e.g.:```pytest -m private_data -v lstchain```To run all tests, run```pytest -m 'private_data or not private_data' -v lstchain```## ContributingAll contribution are welcomed.Guidelines are the same as [ctapipe's ones](https://cta-observatory.github.io/ctapipe/development/index.html)    See [here](https://cta-observatory.github.io/ctapipe/development/pullrequests.html) for the general guidelines on how to make a pull request to contribute to the repository. Since the addition of the private data, the CI tests for Pull Requests from forks are not working, therefore we would like to ask to push your modified branches directly to the main cta-lstchain repo. If you do not have writing permissions in the repo, please contact one of the main developers. ## Report issue / Ask a questionUse [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cta-observatory/cta-lstchain/issues).## CiteIf you use lstchain in a publication, please cite the exact version you used from Zenodo _Cite as_, see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6344673Please also cite the following proceedings by adding the bibtex entry:```@inproceedings{lst_performance_icrc2021,  author = {López-Coto, R. and Moralejo, A. and Artero, M. and Baquero, A. and Bernardos, M. and Contreras, J.
