	<longdescription>************************git-project-core-plugins************************Plugins for `git-project &lt;http://www.github.com/greened/git-project&gt;`_This is a set of basic plugins to manage several aspects of projects kept withingit repositories.  These plugins include commands to:#. Configure git-project and its various plugins#. Clone repositories#. Manage branches#. Manage worktrees#. Run commands (e.g configure/build/install)Setup=====``pip install git-project-core-plugins``Commands========These plugins add a number of commands to git-project.  Each command has anassociated ``--help`` option to describe its function and options.  There isalso a `help` command that accesses more extensive manpage-like descriptions ofcommands.* ``git &lt;project&gt; config``  Configure git-project or any git config sections added by projects.  This will  add ``config`` subcommands to plugin commands that manipulate git config  sections (e.g. ``git project build config``).* ``git &lt;project&gt; clone [--worktree]``  Clone a repository.  Other plugins may hook into this command to provide  additional functionality.  With ``--worktree``, set up a worktree environment.* ``git &lt;project&gt; init [--worktree]``  Initialize a ``git-project`` config in an existing cloed repository.  With  ``--worktree``, setup a worktree environment.* ``git &lt;project&gt; branch status``  Report whether local branches are merged to a project branch and whether the  local branch head is pushed to a remote.* ``git &lt;project&gt; branch prune``  Delete branches that are merged to a project branch and pushed to a remote.* ``git &lt;project&gt; run &lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;]``  Run a pre-configured commandm, passing ``&lt;args&gt;`` to it.* ``git &lt;project&gt; worktree``  Create and manage worktrees for the project.  This plugin gives ``git  &lt;project&gt; clone`` an option to create a special directory layout and a master  worktree when performing a bare clone.  Worktrees can be referenced to set up per-worktree build and install trees  such that switching from worktree to worktree does not result in &quot;rebuilding  the world.&quot;Worktree environment====================A number of commands can have knowledge of a &quot;worktree environment&quot; with aspecific layout:  &lt;path&gt;    .git    worktree1    worktree2    worktree3That is, either a bare clone is done, or an existing clone is converted to abare clone via ``git &lt;project&gt; init --worktree``.  Any conversion will abort ifthe worktree is dirty.  Typically, an ordinary ``git clone`` is followedimmediately by ``git &lt;project&gt; init --worktree``.Examples========Initial setup-------------  git clone &lt;url&gt;  git &lt;project&gt; init --worktreeAdd convenience substitution variables--------------------------------------Adding custom commands----------------------  git &lt;project&gt; run --make-alias configure  git &lt;project&gt; run --make-alias build  git &lt;project&gt; run --make-alias install  git &lt;project&gt; add configure debug &quot;cd {builddir} &amp;&amp; &quot;Command Reference-----------------artifact--------The artifact command adds or removes associations between git config objectsand file-system objects.Summary:  git &lt;project&gt; artifact add &lt;subsection&gt; &lt;path&gt;  git &lt;project&gt; artifact rm &lt;subsection&gt; [&lt;path&gt;]&lt;subsection&gt; is a git config section which will appear under the&lt;project&gt;.artifact section.  Artifacts look up objects associated with&lt;subsection&gt; and perform substitutions on paths to yield the finalassociated file-system object.  The ``artifact rm`` command simply removesan artifact association, it does not remove the artifact itself.  Multipleartifact paths may be associated under a single &lt;subsection&gt; and the option&lt;path&gt; argument to ``artifact rm`` allows us to remove a single associationrather than all of them at once.For example:  git &lt;project&gt; artifact add worktree.myworktree /path/to/artifactPresumably, /path/to/artifact is in some way created in association withmyworktree, for example by the ``run`` command.  When we delete myworktree,the artifact association causes /path/to/artifact to also be removed.Substitutions can make artifact associations easier to manage:  git &lt;project&gt; artifact add worktree /path/to/{worktree}/artifactNotice that we've added the artifact under the more general ``worktree``subsection instead of naming a worktree explicitly as before.  Because the{worktree} substitution appears in the artifact path, deleting any worktreewill cause the worktree's name to be substituted into the artifact path,forming a unique artifact path to remove.We may make this even more general:  git &lt;project&gt; config srcdir &quot;{path}&quot;  git &lt;project&gt; config builddir &quot;{srcdir}/build/{worktree}&quot;  git &lt;project&gt; config make &quot;make -C {srcdir} BUILDDIR={builddir} {build}&quot;  git &lt;project&gt; run --make-alias build  git &lt;project&gt; add build debug &quot;{make}&quot;  git &lt;project&gt; add build release &quot;{make}&quot;  git &lt;project&gt; add build check &quot;{make}&quot;  git &lt;project&gt; artifact add worktree &quot;{builddir}&quot;We've added a single artifact association that will handle any worktree andall of our different build types.  When we delete the worktree, allartifacts related to debug, release and check builds will also be removed.The worktree plugin also modifies the clone and init commands, adding a--worktree option to both.  With --worktree, clone will create a ``worktreelayout`` as so:  clonedir    .git     masterHere, ``master`` is a worktree created from the master branch.  ``clonedir``becames a bare repository, though with refspecs that make it operate like aregular clone for fetch and push operations.  That is, the cloned repositorywill still have refs/heads and refs/remotes namespaces.With --worktree, init will take an existing local clone and convert it to abare repository, removing all checked out files and creating a masterworktree:  clonedir    .git     masterConversion will abort if the workarea is not in a clean state.  Note thatall files in clonedir will be deleted so if there are important files notpart of the underlying repository, the user must take care to preserve them.If the workarea hd a branch other than master checked out, no worktree forit will be created automatically, though the user may easily create oneafter conversion.See also:  clone  config  init  run  worktreebranch------The branch command queries the status of branches against known projectbranches and provides methods to prune old branches.Summary:  git &lt;project&gt; branch status [--all] [&lt;refish&gt;]  git &lt;project&gt; branch prune [--force] [--no-ask]The branch status command checks the given &lt;refish&gt; (or all local brancheswith the --all option) against the project-configured branches.  The commandoutputs a table of branches and whether they are merged to a project branchand/or pushed to a remote.  For example:  git &lt;project&gt; config --add branch release  git &lt;project&gt; branch status mybranchThe report will show whether mybranch is merged to the release or masterbranches (master is always a configured project branch) and whether thecommit pointed to mybranch is pushed to a remote.The branch prune command computes the same information and if the branch ismerged to a project branch and that project branch is pushed to a remote,will ask whether mybranch should be deleted.  If the user indicates yes,both the local mybranch and its remote counterpart, if any, will be deleted.With --force, branches will be pruneed regardless of merge/push status.With --no-ask branch prune operates in batch mode, assuming all merged andpushed branches should be pruned.See also:  configclone-----The clone command clones a repository.Summary:  git &lt;project&gt; clone &lt;url&gt; [&lt;path&gt;] [--bare]By itself clone has just the very basic funcionality of the built-in gitclone command.  Plugins may add options to give the clone command morefeatures.  For example, the woktree command adds a --worktree option to haveclone create a ``worktree layout.``See also:  worktreeconfig------The config command manages git config settings under the &lt;project&gt; section.Summary:  git &lt;project&gt; config [--add] [--unset] &lt;name&gt; [&lt;value&gt;]The config command operates much like git's built-in config command, exceptall configuration keys are prefixed with &lt;project&gt;, keeping values under asingle project namespace.  This is a convenient way to store parameters forother commands.  For example:  git &lt;project&gt; config builddir /path/to/build  git &lt;project&gt; add run build &quot;make BUILDDIR={builddir} all&quot;Configuration kays may have their values substituted into otherconfiguration values via the {key} specifier.  Special commands like buildperform the substitution recursively, so configuration vaalues may containsubstitutions of other configuration values which themselves containsubstitutions, and so on.  Importantly, substitution only happens whencommands are run.  Commands should document whether or not they performsubstitutions.A git config ``sub-section`` may be substituted with its identifier.  Forexample:  git &lt;project&gt; worktree add myworktree  git &lt;project&gt; config builddir /path/to/{worktree}/buildHere, myworktree is the identifier of a specific worktree sub-section.  Ifmyworktree is the currently active worktree (that is, the current directoryis under the myworktree root), then ``myworktree`` will substitute for{woktree}.See also:  run  worktreehelp----The help command displays tutorial-style help for commands.Summary:  git &lt;project&gt; add help [--manpage] &lt;subsection&gt; &lt;text&gt;  git &lt;project&gt; help &lt;command&gt;Users may add help to any project config section.  For example:  git &lt;project&gt; add help run.build &quot;Perform a build&quot;  git &lt;project&gt; add help run.check &quot;Run tests&quot;All help is stored under a &lt;project&gt;.help config sub-section.  If a commandsupports it, such help may appear in the command's own help output byquerying the appropriate &lt;project&gt;.help sub-section:  git &lt;project&gt; run --help  &lt;standard help text&gt;  build     -- Perform a build  check     -- Run testsIn this way projects can self-document their configurations.  Normally&lt;text&gt; is stored in &lt;project&gt;.help.&lt;subsection&gt;.short.  With --manpage,&lt;text&gt; is stored in &lt;project&gt;.help.&lt;subsection&gt;.manpage.  Commands mayreference short help or manpages in various ways to present help.See also:  runinit----The init command initializes project state.Summary:  git &lt;project&gt; initBasic config entries are added to name the project and default branches.Plugins may add options to enhance functionality.  For example the worktreecommand adds a --worktree option to convert an existing local clone to a``worktree layout.``See also:  worktreerun---The run command executes commands via a shell.Summary:  git &lt;project&gt; add run &lt;name&gt; &lt;command&gt;  git &lt;project&gt; run --make-alias &lt;name&gt;  git &lt;project&gt; run &lt;name&gt;Full shell substitution is supported, as well as config {key} substitution,where the text ``{key}`` is replaced by key's value.The add run command associates a command string with a name.  The runcommand itself invokes the command string via a shell.  With --make-alias,the run comand instead registers an alternative name for ``run.``  Forexample:  git &lt;project&gt; run --make-alias build  git &lt;project&gt; add build all &quot;make -C {path} all&quot;  git &lt;project&gt; build allNote that an alias will prevent ``run`` from invoking the command so in theabove example we could not invoke the build as such:  git &lt;project&gt; run allIn this way we may use the same &lt;name&gt; for different registered run aliases,which can be convenient:  git &lt;project&gt; build all  git &lt;project&gt; check allIn general any project config {key} will be replaced with its value beforethe command is executed.  Substitution occurs recursively, so if a {key}value itself contains a substitution string, it will be replaced as well.There are a few special case substitutions.  The {path} key will be replacedby the absolute path to the root of the current workarea.  The {branch} keywill be replaced by the currently-active branch nme.  In addition the {run}(or {build}, etc. aliases) will be replaced by their names.  Again, anexample will make this more clear:  git &lt;project&gt; config cmd &quot;make -C {path} BLDDIR=/path/to/{build} {build}&quot;  git project add build all &quot;{cmd}&quot;  git project add build some &quot;{cmd}&quot;We have configured two different build flavors, each which place buildresults in separate directories and invoke different targets.  Substitutionproceeds as follows:  git project build all -&gt; make -C /cur/workarea BLDDIR=/path/to/all all  git project build some -&gt; make -C /cur/workarea BLDDIR=/path/to/some someSome plugins may add scoping rules to the project config, such that a scopenested inside the project may override the global project config key value.For example the worktree plugin adds a ``worktree`` scope.  The worktree maycontain key values that override similar keys in the project config.See also:  config  worktreeworktree--------The worktree command manages worktrees and connects them to projects.Summary:  git &lt;project&gt; worktree add [-b &lt;branch&gt;] &lt;name-or-path&gt; [&lt;committish&gt;]  git &lt;project&gt; worktree rm &lt;name-or-path&gt;  git &lt;project&gt; worktree config &lt;key&gt; [&lt;value&gt;]  git &lt;project&gt; worktree config [--unset] &lt;key&gt; [&lt;value&gt;]``worktree add`` creates a new git worktree named via &lt;name-or-path&gt; with&lt;committish&gt; checked out.  If we pass -b &lt;branch&gt; we'll get a new branch atHEAD or &lt;committish&gt; if it is given.  The worktree name is either the givenname or if name-or-path is a path, the worktree name will be the same as thelast path component.  If &lt;name-or-path&gt; is a simple name with no directoryseparators, the worktree will be created as a sub-directory of the currentdirectory.To keep things simple, we'll usually always name worktrees similarly (oridentically) to the branches they reference, though it is not strictlynecessary to do so.The key idea behind project worktrees is that they are connected to various``artifacts.``  Worktrees are managed together with this artifacts toprovide a project-level view of various tasks.  For example, a ``run``command can create artifacts associated with a worktree.  Removing theworktree implicitly removes thee artifacts, making build cleanups easy andconvenient.  Commands may use the {worktree} substitution to createworktree-unique artifacts.  Other substitutions may also referece {worktree}in a recursive manner.Here is a concrete example:  git &lt;project&gt; config srcdir &quot;{path}&quot;  git &lt;project&gt; config builddir &quot;{srcdir}/build/{worktree}&quot;  git &lt;project&gt; config make &quot;make -C {srcdir} BUILDDIR={builddir} {build}&quot;  git &lt;project&gt; run --make-alias build  git &lt;project&gt; add build release &quot;{make}&quot;Assuming the build system uses BUILDDIR to determine where build artifactsgo, each worktree will get a unique set of build artifacts, via the{builddir} and, recursively., {worktree} substitutions.  When we delete theworktree, we'll also delete the associoated build directory.We associate artifacts with worktrees via the artifact commands.Another important benefit of worktrees and associated builds is thatswitching to work on a new worktree (by simply editing sources in adifferent worktree directory) will not result in build artifacts from thteprevious worktree being overwritten.  Thus we avoid the ``rebuild theworld`` problems of switching branches within the same workarea.  Generally,each created branch will have its own worktree and we will rarely, if ever,switch branches within a worktree.A worktree layers a config scope on top of the global project scope, so thatconfiguring a key in the worktree with the same name as a key in the projectwill cause the worktree key's value to override the project key's value:  git &lt;project&gt; config buildwidth 16  git &lt;project&gt; worktree config buildwidth 32If we are in a worktree configured with buildwidth=32, then wherever{buildwidth} apeears (say, in a run command), the value 32 will besubstituted instead of 16.  If we are outside the worktree (for example aworktree without a buildwidth configured), then {buildwidth} will besubstituted with 16.See also:  artifact  config  run</longdescription>
