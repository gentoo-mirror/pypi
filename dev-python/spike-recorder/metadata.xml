Itis based off a [fork](https://github.com/davidt0x/Spike-Recorder) of the original C++ code, found [here](https://github.com/BackyardBrains/Spike-Recorder). In addition, it contains two psychological experiment applications written in Python that control and record events via the SpikeRecorder. ## InstallationYou can install this library from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/spike-recorder/) with pip:```bashpython -m pip install spike-recorder```## UsageTo run the SpikeRecorder application simply invoke it on the command line```bashspike-recorder```If you want to launch the SpikeRecorder application alongside either of the experimentsbelow then invoke them with the `--spike-reord` option. ## Iowa Gambling Task![Iowa Task Screenshot](docs/images/iowa_task_screenshot.png?raw=true &quot;Iowa Task Screenshow&quot;)To launch the Iowa Gambling Task Experiment, run:```bashiowa```There are some available options and arguments:```usage: iowa [-h] [--spike-record] [--total-deck-pulls TOTAL_DECK_PULLS]optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  --spike-record        Launch Backyard Brains Spike Recorder in background. Default is do not run.  --total-deck-pulls TOTAL_DECK_PULLS                        The total number of deck pulls in the experiment. Default is 100.```## Libet Experiment![Libet Experiment Screenshot](docs/images/libet_task_screenshot.png?raw=true &quot;Iowa Task Screenshow&quot;)To launch the Libet Task Experiment, simply run:```bashlibet```If you wish to adjust the speed of the clock or the number of trials in either phase, see the available options:```usage: libet [-h] [--spike-record] [--num-trials-paradigm1 NUM_TRIALS_PARADIGM1] [--num-trials-paradigm2 NUM_TRIALS_PARADIGM2] [--clock-hz-paradigm1 CLOCK_HZ_PARADIGM1] [--clock-hz-paradigm2 CLOCK_HZ_PARADIGM2]optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  --spike-record        Launch Backyard Brains Spike Recorder in background.                         Default is do not run.  --num-trials-paradigm1 NUM_TRIALS_PARADIGM1                        The number of trials to conduct for paradigm one. Default is 20.  --num-trials-paradigm2 NUM_TRIALS_PARADIGM2                        The number of trials to conduct for paradigm two,                         in which time of urge is asked. Default is 20.  --clock-hz-paradigm1 CLOCK_HZ_PARADIGM1                        The number of full rotations the clock makes per second in paradigm one.                         Default is 1 but can be set lower than 1.  --clock-hz-paradigm2 CLOCK_HZ_PARADIGM2                        The number of full rotations the clock makes per second in paradigm two.                         Default is 1 but can be set lower than 1.```[actions-badge]:            https://github.com/davidt0x/py-spike-recorder/workflows/CI/badge.svg[actions-link]:             https://github.com/davidt0x/py-spike-recorderactions[black-badge]:              https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg[black-link]:               https://github.com/psf/black[conda-badge]:              https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/spike-recorder[conda-link]:               https://github.com/conda-forge/spike-recorder-feedstock[gitter-badge]:             https://badges.gitter.im/PrincetonUniversity/py-spike-recorder.svg[gitter-link]:              https://gitter.im/PrincetonUniversity/py-spike-recorder?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge&amp;utm_content=badge[pypi-link]:                https://pypi.org/project/spike-recorder/[pypi-platforms]:           https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/spike-recorder[pypi-version]:             https://badge.fury.io/py/spike-recorder.svg[rtd-badge]:                https://readthedocs.org/projects/spike-recorder/badge/?version=latest[rtd-link]:                 https://spike-recorder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest[sk-badge]:                 https://scikit-hep.org/assets/images/Scikit--HEP-Project-blue.svg</longdescription>
