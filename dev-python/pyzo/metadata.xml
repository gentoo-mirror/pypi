	<longdescription>Pyzo is a cross-platform Python IDE focused oninteractivity and introspection, which makes it very suitable forscientific computing. Its practical design is aimed at simplicity andefficiency.Pyzo is written in Python 3 and Qt. Binaries are available for Windows,Linux, and Mac. For questions, there is a discussion group.**Two components + tools**Pyzo consists of two main components, the editor and the shell, and usesa set of pluggable tools to help the programmer in various ways. Someexample tools are source structure, project manager, interactive help,and workspace.**Some key features*** Powerful *introspection* (autocompletion, calltips, interactive help)* Allows various ways to *run code interactively* or to run a file as a script.* The shells runs in a *subprocess* and can therefore be interrupted or killed.* *Multiple shells* can be used at the same time, and can be of different  Python versions (from v2.4 to 3.x, including pypy)* Support for using several *GUI toolkits* interactively:  asyncio, PySide, PySide2, PyQt4, PyQt5, wx, fltk, GTK, Tk, Tornado.* Run IPython shell or native shell.* *Full Unicode support* in both editor and shell.* Various handy *tools*, plus the ability to make your own.* Matlab-style *cell notation* to mark code sections (by starting a line  with '##').</longdescription>
