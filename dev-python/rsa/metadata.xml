It supportsencryption and decryption, signing and verifying signatures, and keygeneration according to PKCS#1 version 1.5. It can be used as a Pythonlibrary as well as on the commandline. The code was mostly written bySybren A.  St√ºvel.Documentation can be found at the [Python-RSA homepage](https://stuvel.eu/rsa). For all changes, check [the changelog](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).Download and install using:    pip install rsaor download it from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/rsa/).The source code is maintained at [GitHub](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/) and islicensed under the [Apache License, version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)## SecurityBecause of how Python internally stores numbers, it is very hard (if not impossible) to make a pure-Python program secure against timing attacks. This library is no exception, so use it with care. See https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2018/08/03/constant-time-compare-in-python/ for more info.## Setup of Development Environment```python3 -m venv .venv. ./.venv/bin/activatepip install poetrypoetry install```## Publishing a New ReleaseSince this project is considered critical on the Python Package Index,two-factor authentication is required. For uploading packages to PyPi, an APIkey is required; username+password will not work.First, generate an API token at https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/. Then,use this token when publishing instead of your username and password.As username, use `__token__`.As password, use the token itself, including the `pypi-` prefix.See https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken for help using API tokens to publish. Thisis what I have in `~/.pypirc`:```[distutils]index-servers =    rsa# Use `twine upload -r rsa` to upload with this token.[rsa]  repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/  username = __token__  password = pypi-token``````. ./.venv/bin/activatepip install twinepoetry buildtwine check dist/rsa-4.9.tar.gz dist/rsa-4.9-*.whltwine upload -r rsa dist/rsa-4.9.tar.gz dist/rsa-4.9-*.whl```The `pip install twine` is necessary as Python-RSA requires Python &gt;= 3.6, andTwine requires at least version 3.7. This means Poetry refuses to add it asdependency.</longdescription>
