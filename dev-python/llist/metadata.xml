	<longdescription>llist - linked lists for CPython================================llist is an extension module for CPython providing basic linked listdata structures.Collections implemented in the llist module perform well in problemswhich rely on fast insertions and/or deletions of elements inthe middle of a sequence.For this kind of workload, they can be significantly faster thancollections.deque or standard Python lists.This extension requires CPython 2.5 or newer (3.x is supported).If you are looking for an implementation of linked lists in pure Python,visit http://github.com/rgsoda/pypy-llist/The pypy-llist module has the same API as this extension, but issignificantly slower in CPython.Currently llist provides the following types of linked lists: - dllist - a doubly linked list - sllist - a singly linked listFull documentation of these classes is available at:https://ajakubek.github.io/python-llist/index.htmlTo install this package, either run &quot;pip install llist&quot;,or download it manually from http://pypi.python.org/pypithen unpack the sources and compile them with &quot;python setup.py install&quot;.The most current development version is available at:https://github.com/ajakubek/python-llist/Bugs can be reported at:https://github.com/ajakubek/python-llist/issuesThis software is distributed under the MIT license.Please see the LICENSE file included in the package for details.[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ajakubek/python-llist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ajakubek/python-llist)</longdescription>
