It's a community driveninitiative called **IHAP** (Incident Handling Automation Project) whichwas conceptually designed by European CERTs/CSIRTs during severalInfoSec events. Its main goal is to give to incident responders an easyway to collect &amp; process threat intelligence thus improving the incidenthandling processes of CERTs.IntelMQ can be used for- automated incident handling- situational awareness- automated notifications- as data collector for other tools- etc.IntelMQ's design was influenced by `AbuseHelper &lt;https://github.com/abusesa/abusehelper&gt;`__,however it was re-written from scratch and aims at:-  Reducing the complexity of system administration-  Reducing the complexity of writing new bots for new data feeds-  Reducing the probability of events lost in all process with   persistence functionality (even system crash)-  Use and improve the existing Data Harmonization Ontology-  Use JSON format for all messages-  Provide easy way to store data into Log Collectors like   ElasticSearch, Splunk, databases (such as PostgreSQL)-  Provide easy way to create your own black-lists-  Provide easy communication with other systems via HTTP RESTful APIIt follows the following basic meta-guidelines:-  Don't break simplicity - KISS-  Keep it open source - forever-  Strive for perfection while keeping a deadline-  Reduce complexity/avoid feature bloat-  Embrace unit testing-  Code readability: test with unexperienced programmers-  Communicate clearly============Getting Help============IntelMQ's documentation is available at `intelmq.readthedocs.io &lt;https://intelmq.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_.For support questions please reach out on the `the intelmq-users mailing list &lt;https://lists.cert.at/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/intelmq-users&gt;`_==============================IntelMQ Manager and more tools==============================Several pieces of software evolved around IntelMQ. For example, check out `IntelMQ Manager &lt;https://github.com/certtools/intelmq-manager&gt;`_ which is a web based interface to easily manage an IntelMQ system.More tools can be found in the `IntelMQ Universe chapter in the documentation &lt;https://intelmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/universe.html&gt;`_.==================How to participate==================IntelMQ is a community project depending on your contributions. Please consider sharing your work.- Have a look at our `Developers Guide &lt;https://intelmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/guide.html&gt;`_ for documentation.- Subscribe to the `Intelmq-dev Mailing list &lt;https://lists.cert.at/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/intelmq-dev&gt;`_ to get answers to your development questions:- The `Github issues &lt;https://github.com/certtools/intelmq/issues/&gt;`_ lists all the open feature requests, bug reports and ideas.====================================Incident Handling Automation Project====================================- **URL:** http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-handling-automation- **Mailing-list:** ihap@lists.trusted-introducer.org=======Licence=======This software is licensed under GNU Affero General Public License version 3=======Funding=======This project was partially funded by the CEF framework.. figure:: https://ec.europa.eu/inea/sites/default/files/ceflogos/en_horizontal_cef_logo_2.png   :alt: Co-financed by the Connecting Europe Facility of the European Union.. |Build Status| image:: https://github.com/certtools/intelmq/workflows/Nosetest%20test%20suite/badge.svg   :target: https://github.com/certtools/intelmq/actions.. |CII Badge| image:: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/4186/badge   :target: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/4186/</longdescription>
