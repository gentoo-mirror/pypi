	<longdescription>==================================Phi_K Correlation Analyzer Library==================================* Version: 0.12.3. Released: Dec 2022* Release notes: https://github.com/KaveIO/PhiK/blob/master/CHANGES.rst* Repository: https://github.com/kaveio/phik* Documentation: https://phik.readthedocs.io* Publication: `[offical] &lt;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167947320301341&gt;`_ `[arxiv pre-print] &lt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11440&gt;`_Phi_K is a practical correlation constant that works consistently between categorical, ordinal and interval variables.It is based on several refinements to Pearson's hypothesis test of independence of two variables. Essentially, thecontingency test statistic of two variables is interpreted as coming from a rotated bi-variate normal distribution,where the tilt is interpreted as Phi_K.The combined features of Phi_K form an advantage over existing coefficients. First, it works consistently between categorical, ordinal and interval variables.Second, it captures non-linear dependency. Third, it reverts to the Pearson correlation coefficient in case of a bi-variate normal input distribution.These are useful features when studying the correlation matrix of variables with mixed types.For details on the methodology behind the calculations, please see our publication. Emphasis is paid to the proper evaluation of statistical significance of correlations and to the interpretation of variable relationshipsin a contingency table, in particular in case of low statistics samples.The presented algorithms are easy to use and available through this public Python library.Example notebooks=================.. list-table::   :widths: 60 40   :header-rows: 1   * - Static link     - Google Colab link   * - `basic tutorial &lt;https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KaveIO/PhiK/blob/master/phik/notebooks/phik_tutorial_basic.ipynb&gt;`_     - `basic on colab &lt;https://colab.research.google.com/github/KaveIO/PhiK/blob/master/phik/notebooks/phik_tutorial_basic.ipynb&gt;`_   * - `advanced tutorial (detailed configuration) &lt;https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KaveIO/PhiK/blob/master/phik/notebooks/phik_tutorial_advanced.ipynb&gt;`_     - `advanced on colab &lt;https://colab.research.google.com/github/KaveIO/PhiK/blob/master/phik/notebooks/phik_tutorial_advanced.ipynb&gt;`_   * - `spark tutorial &lt;https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KaveIO/PhiK/blob/master/phik/notebooks/phik_tutorial_spark.ipynb&gt;`_     - no spark availableDocumentation=============The entire Phi_K documentation including tutorials can be found at `read-the-docs &lt;https://phik.readthedocs.io&gt;`_.See the tutorials for detailed examples on how to run the code with pandas. We also have one example on howcalculate the Phi_K correlation matrix for a spark dataframe.Check it out============The Phi_K library requires Python &gt;= 3.7 and is pip friendly. To get started, simply do:.. code-block:: bash  $ pip install phikor check out the code from out GitHub repository:.. code-block:: bash  $ git clone https://github.com/KaveIO/PhiK.git  $ pip install -e PhiK/where in this example the code is installed in edit mode (option -e).You can now use the package in Python with:.. code-block:: python  import phik**Congratulations, you are now ready to use the PhiK correlation analyzer library!**Quick run=========As a quick example, you can do:.. code-block:: python  import pandas as pd  import phik  from phik import resources, report  # open fake car insurance data  df = pd.read_csv( resources.fixture('fake_insurance_data.csv.gz') )  df.head()  # Pearson's correlation matrix between numeric variables (pandas functionality)  df.corr()  # get the phi_k correlation matrix between all variables  df.phik_matrix()  # get global correlations based on phi_k correlation matrix  df.global_phik()  # get the significance matrix (expressed as one-sided Z)  # of the hypothesis test of each variable-pair dependency  df.significance_matrix()  # contingency table of two columns  cols = ['mileage','car_size']  df[cols].hist2d()  # normalized residuals of contingency test applied to cols  df[cols].outlier_significance_matrix()  # show the normalized residuals of each variable-pair  df.outlier_significance_matrices()  # generate a phik correlation report and save as test.pdf  report.correlation_report(df, pdf_file_name='test.pdf')For all available examples, please see the `tutorials &lt;https://phik.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html&gt;`_ at read-the-docs.Contact and support===================* Issues and Ideas: https://github.com/kaveio/phik/issuesPlease note that support is (only) provided on a best-effort basis.</longdescription>
