	<longdescription># `measured``measured` is a library for measurements and quantities.[![PyPi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/measured)](https://pypi.org/project/measured)[![Build and test](https://github.com/chrisguidry/measured/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/chrisguidry/measured/actions)[![Code Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/chrisguidry/measured?flag=python-3.10)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/chrisguidry/measured/)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/measured/badge/?version=latest)](https://measured.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)```python&gt;&gt;&gt; from measured import Speed&gt;&gt;&gt; from measured.si import Meter, Second&gt;&gt;&gt; distance = 10 * Meter&gt;&gt;&gt; time = 2 * Second&gt;&gt;&gt; speed = distance / time&gt;&gt;&gt; assert speed == 5 * Meter / Second&gt;&gt;&gt; assert speed.unit is Meter / Second&gt;&gt;&gt; assert speed.unit.dimension is Speed```The goal of `measured` is to provide a sound foundation for recording and convertingphysical quantities, while maintaining the integrity of their units and dimensions.While it aims to be the fastest library of its kind, automatically tracking the unitsand dimensions of quantities introduces significant overhead.  You can use `measured`for applications where the accuracy of the units is more important than raw numericalcomputing speed.`measured` is licenced under the MIT Licence.[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/chrisguidry/measured)](https://github.com/chrisguidry/measured/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)## Installing`measured` is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/measured), and is tested withwith Python and PyPy 3.8+:```bash$ pip install measured```[![Python Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/measured)](https://pypi.org/project/measured)## ReferenceThe documentation for `measured` is on [Read theDocs](https://measured.readthedocs.io/).## ContributingContributions are welcome!
