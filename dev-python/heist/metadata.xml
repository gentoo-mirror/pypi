	<longdescription>=====Heist=====Heist creates network tunnels for distributing and managing agents. While it hasbeen originally built to deploy and manage Salt Minions, it can be used todistribute and manage other agents or plugins if extended to do so.Using Heist is very easy, Start by downloading Heist. Just install via`pip`:.. code-block:: bash        pip install heistHeist Manager=============In order to run Heist you will need to specify a Heist manager. An example of aheist manager is `salt.minion` but this will require a user to install the`heist-salt &lt;https://heist-salt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_ project:.. code-block:: bash        pip install heist-saltMaking Your Roster==================A Roster is a file used by Heist to map login information to thesystems in your environment. This file can be very simple and justneeds to tell Heist where your systems are and how to log into themvia ssh. Open a file called `roster.cfg` and add the data needed to connectto a remote system via ssh:.. code-block:: yaml    system_name:      host: 192.168.4.4      username: fred      password: freds_password.. note::    This example is very simple, heist supports virtually all available authentication    options for ssh.The roster files typically all live inside of a roster directory. But to getstarted we will execute a single roster file with Heist using the `salt.minion` Heistmanager:.. code-block:: bash    heist salt.minion -R roster.cfgAssuming your roster is correct, heist will now connect to the remotesystem and deploy the `salt.minion` binary.Tear Down=========Heist is able to automatically clean up as well! Just soft killyour heist application and it will reach out to all connections, tell them toremove the deployed artifacts from the target systems and stop the service!Like a proper heist these should be no evidence left behind!Using Heist to Deploy Salt Minions==================================If you want to use Heist to deploy and manage Salt, you will need to install`heist-salt &lt;https://heist-salt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_.Additional Documentation========================If you want to read more about how to use Heist and its internals pleasetake a look at Heist's documentation here: https://heist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</longdescription>
