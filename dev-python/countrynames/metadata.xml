	<longdescription># countrynames[![build](https://github.com/alephdata/countrynames/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alephdata/countrynames/actions/workflows/build.yml)This library helps with the mapping of country names to their respectivetwo or three letter codes. The idea isto incorporate common names for countries, and even some limited misspellings,as they occur in source data.There is also support for fuzzy matching, which uses a heuristic based on Levenshtein distance.## Usage```pythonimport countrynamesassert 'DE' == countrynames.to_code('Germany')assert 'DE' == countrynames.to_code('Bundesrepublik Deutschland')assert 'DE' == countrynames.to_code('Bundesrepublik Deutschlan', fuzzy=True)assert 'DE' == countrynames.to_code('DE')assert 'DEU' == countrynames.to_code_3('Germany')```## Non-standard country codes* ``XK`` or ``XKX`` - Kosovo* ``EU`` or ``EUU`` - European UnionFor some dissolved countries (e.g. `SUHH` for Soviet Union) and sub-regions(e.g. `GB-SCT` for Scotland) special codes are defined and returned from both`to_code` and `to_code_3`.## LicenseThe MIT License (MIT)Copyright (c) 2016 Friedrich LindenbergPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy ofthis software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal inthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights touse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies ofthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESSFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
