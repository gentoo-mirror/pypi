	<longdescription>django-tracer========================[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/revsys/django-tracer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/revsys/django-tracer)Generate a UUID for all requests to Django to be used in logging and error reporting for traceability. # Why? Why would you want to use this silly little thing? Well in a containerized, orchestrated, microservice world with centralized logging it's often hard to figure out where things have gone wrong.  This little middleware adds a UUID to the normal Django request object which you can use to add to add to things like: - All of your log messages- Error reports to Sentry/Rollbar/etc- Pass along to other internal servicesAlong with generating and attaching a UUID to each request, the middleware also automatically adds the UUID to the response headers as `X-Request-ID` so anyone consuming your responses, say as an API, can use that as a reference point for reporting errors back to you. # InstallationFirst you need to install it via pip: ```shellpip install django-tracer```Then just add `tracer` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your settings. Then add `tracer.middleware.RequestID` to the top of your `MIDDLEWARE` settings. # Usage with standard logging```pythonimport loggingfrom django.http import HttpResponselogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)def some_view(request):    &quot;&quot;&quot; simple log example &quot;&quot;&quot;    logger.info(&quot;Whee!&quot;, extra={'request_id': request.id})    return HttpResponse(&quot;example content&quot;)```## Other ways to use this Request IDThere are several other places you may consider wanting to use the ID to improve traceability: - Pass it as an argument to any Celery tasks you generate so there is a clear path between the incoming request and the tasks that were generated from it- Pass it as a header or argument to other internal APIs or services - Attach it to a bound [structlog](http://www.structlog.org/) object so it is always included in your log output# Thanks!
