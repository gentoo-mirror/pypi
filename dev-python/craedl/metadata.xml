	<longdescription># Craedl Python SDKThe Craedl Python SDK (Software Development Kit) enables Craedl users to accesstheir [Craedl](https://craedl.org) accounts using the Python programminglanguage. This provides a mechanism for using Craedl on computers without accessto a web browser (such as a high-performance computing cluster) and to automatecommon Craedl project manipulations (such as file uploads and downloads) withina Python script.## Quick startGet started with the Craedl Python SDK by obtaining it via[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/craedl/):```pip install craedl```Log into your Craedl account at [Craedl.org](https://craedl.org) and generate anAPI access token by clicking the key tab in your profile view. Copy your tokenand paste it when prompted after running one of the following commands:**(A) Configure your account through a system shell**```python -m craedl```**(B) Configure your account through an interactive Python interpreter**```import craedlcraedl.configure()```Now you can use Python to access your Craedl, for example:```import craedlprofile = craedl.auth()for craedl in profile.craedls:    print(craedl)```## More informationFor more information about the Craedl Python SDK, refer to[our documentation](https://craedl-sdk-python.readthedocs.io).
