Synapse's default admin API endpoint address usually is http://localhost:8008/_synapse/admin or https://localhost:8448/_synapse/admin.## Installation### Install from PyPI`pip3 install synadm`### Install from git&lt;!-- omit in toc --&gt;#### 1. Check Python Version`python3 --version` should show at least v3.6.x&lt;!-- omit in toc --&gt;#### 2. Clone Repo:```git clone https://github.com/joj0/synadm```&lt;!-- omit in toc --&gt;#### 3. Install Package GloballyThis will install `synadm` and all dependent Python packages to your system's global Python site-packages directory:```cd synadmsudo pip install .```*Note: If you get an import error for setuptools, make sure the package is installed. Debian based systems: `sudo apt install python3-setuptools`, RedHat based: `sudo yum install python3-setuptools`* &lt;!-- omit in toc --&gt;#### 4. Run`synadm` should now run fine without having to add a path in front of it:```synadm -h```*Note: Usually setuptools installs a command wrapper to `/usr/local/bin/synadm`, but that depends on your system.**Note: In case you don't want `synadm` to be installed to a global system directory, you can find an [alternative way of installing](CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-the-source--installing) in the contribution docs*.*Note: synadm is multi-user aware - it stores its configuration inside the executing user's home directory. See chapter [configuration](#configuration).*## Configuration### Getting an Admin TokenTo find out your admin user's token in Element-Web: _Login as this user - &quot;Click User Avatar&quot; - &quot;All Settings&quot; - &quot;Help &amp; About&quot; - Scroll down - &quot;Advanced&quot; - &quot;Access Token&quot;_Or use synadm to fetch a token already. Use the fully qualified Matrix ID of the admin user:```synadm matrix login @admin_username:yourdomain.orgPassword:```If you issue this command in a fresh `synadm` installation, [the configurator](#the-configurator) will launch anyway.- Answer the questions.- Set token to &quot;invalid&quot; at first, to convience `synadm` to launch the `matrix login` command (otherwise you'd get a &quot;Configuration incomplete&quot; error).- After successfully entering your admin password you will be presented a token which you can finally set by re-launching the configurator as described below.### The configurator`synadm` asks for necessary configuration items on first launch automatically. Also whenever new mandatory configuration items where added (eg after an update), the user will be prompted for missing items automatically.Configuration can be changed any time by launching the configurator directly:```synadm config```Configuration will be saved in `~/.config/synadm.yaml`*Note: Be aware that once you configured `synadm`, your admin user's token is saved in the configuration file. On Posix compatible systems permissions are set to mode 0600, on other OS's it is your responsibilty to change permissions accordingly.*### matrix-docker-ansible-deployTo use `synadm` with Synapse homeservers that were installed using [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) you have two options.Access the Synapse Admin API's &quot;via the public endpoint&quot; similar to a Matrix client.- In [vars.yaml](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook.md#configuring-the-ansible-playbook) set `matrix_nginx_proxy_proxy_matrix_client_api_forwarded_location_synapse_admin_api_enabled: true`.- The API's are accessible on the Client-Server API port, at `https://matrix.DOMAIN`.- Install `synadm` on your Docker host or on a separate machine.- Configure `synadm` to access at `https://matrix.DOMAIN:443/_synapse/admin`Alternatively, you can access the API's on the container network `matrix`.- Synapse is accessible via the hostname `matrix-synapse` resolved by the internal Docker DNS server.- The containers are connected internally via a network named `matrix` by default.- Start a container on that same network and install `synadm` into it.- Configure `synadm` to access at `http://matrix-synapse:8008/_synapse/admin` (http here, not https).Find some more details about the topic in [this issue post on the matrix-docker-ansible-deploy repo](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/issues/1846#issuecomment-1135516112)._Note that currently `synadm` is using a part of the Server-Server (Federation) API (`keys/v2/server`) to retrieve &quot;its own homeserver name&quot;. This affects some of the `media` management commands. By default and also as the Matrix spec recommends, this API is not accessible via the Client-Server API port. We are working on a better solution to retrieve the own servername but as a workaround the `key` API's can be exposed by setting `matrix_synapse_http_listener_resource_names: [&quot;client&quot;,&quot;keys&quot;]` in [vars.yaml](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook.md#configuring-the-ansible-playbook)._Find more details about the topic [here](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/issues/1761#issuecomment-1101170229).## UsageUse the online help of the main command:```synadm -h```and of the available subcommands:```synadm version -hsynadm user -hsynadm room -h```You even can spare the `-h` option, `synadm` will show some abbreviated help for the executed subcommand anyway. For example:```synadm user```or```synadm user details```will show essential help for the particular subcommand right away.*Note: A list of currently available commands is found in chapter [implementation status / commands list](#implementation-status--commands-list)* as well as in the following chapter.### Command Line ReferenceA detailed [Command Line Reference](https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index_cli_reference.html) can be found in `synadm's` readthedocs documentation.### Advanced UsageExamples of how `synadm` can be used in shell scripts and oneliners isprovided in the[Scripting Examples](https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html)docs chapter.## Update### Update PyPI Package```pip3 install synadm --upgrade```### Update git InstallationTo update `synadm` to the latest development state, just update your git repo and reinstall:```cd synadmgit pullpip install .```*Note: If you installed it to a Python venv, [activate it](CONTRIBUTING.md#3-set-up-a-python3-virtual-environment).**Note: If you installed it in [editable mode](CONTRIBUTING.md#4-install-in-editable-mode) (or for development), you can spare the `pip install .` command - just `git pull` and you're done.*## Implementation Status / Commands List[Follow this link to the official Synapse Admin API docs](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html) - direct links to the specific API documentation pages are provided in the list below.*Note: Most commands have several optional arguments available.

Usually you'll find `synadm` users there that might answer your questions already. If not, mentioning `synadm` will ping us with the help of Element's keyword notify feature and we'll try to get in touch.The most direct way to reach synadm maintainers as well as seasoned users and Synapse admins is by joining [#synadm:peek-a-boo.at](https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at).If you are sure you've found a bug that was not already reported, certainly directly opening an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/issues) is a valid option too. If unsure, ask in [#synadm:peek-a-boo.at](https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at) first.## ContributingFirst of all, thanks for your interest in contributing to `synadm`! We appreciate any help, no matter if you are a programmer or a user. Both groups can do valuable things for the `synadm` project. We love providing a useful tool to fellow Synapse sysadmins but rely on contribution from the Synapse and Matrix community to keep `synadm` useful, current and stable.Please review the [contributing docs](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines and help around the topic!</longdescription>
