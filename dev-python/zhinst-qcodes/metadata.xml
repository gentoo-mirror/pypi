	<longdescription># Zurich Instruments Drivers for QCoDeS (zhinst-qcodes)The Zurich Instruments drivers for QCoDeS (zhinst-qcodes) is a package ofinstrument drivers for devices produced by [Zurich Instruments](https://www.zhinst.com)for QCoDeS. [QCoDeS](http://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes) is a Python-based dataacquisition framework developed to serve the needs of nanoelectronic deviceexperiments, but not limited to that. It is intended to be used within QCoDeSand not as standalone package. The QCoDeS instrument drivers are based on the[Zurich Instruments Toolkit](https://github.com/zhinst/zhinst-toolkit). So ifyou are looking for a framework independent high level python API, zhinst-toolkitit the right place for you.## StatusThe zhinst-qcodes is well tested and considered stable enough for general usage.The interfaces may have some incompatible changes between releases. Please checkthe changelog when updating.### Refactoring with version 0.3Version 0.3 is a more or less complete new driver and breaks the API comparedto the previous version in many ways. If you upgrade from an older version takea look at the dedicated[documentation page](https://docs.zhinst.com/zhinst-qcodes/en/latest/refactoring/index.html)for more information.## InstallInstall the package with pip:```pip install zhinst-qcodes```## DocumentationSee the documentation page [here](https://docs.zhinst.com/zhinst-qcodes/en/latest).Since zhinst-qcodes is based on zhinst-toolkit and has exactly the same interfaceand functions, the [documentation](https://docs.zhinst.com/zhinst-toolkit/en/latest)for zhinst-toolkit can be applied nearly one to one and has much more examples.## ContributingWe welcome contributions by the community, either as bug reports, fixes and newcode.
