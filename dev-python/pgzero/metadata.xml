	<longdescription>Pygame Zero===========A zero-boilerplate games programming framework for Python 3, based on Pygame.Some examples-------------Pygame Zero consists of a runner ``pgzrun`` that will run a Pygame Zero scriptwith a full game loop and a range of useful builtins.Here's some of the neat stuff you can do. Note that each of these is aself-contained script. There's no need for any imports or anything else in thefile.Draw graphics (assuming there's  a file like ``images/dog.png`` or``images/dog.jpg``)::    def draw():        screen.clear()        screen.blit('dog', (10, 50))Play the sound ``sounds/eep.wav`` when you click the mouse::    def on_mouse_down():        sounds.eep.play()Draw an &quot;actor&quot; object (with the sprite ``images/alien.png``) that moves acrossthe screen::    alien = Actor('alien')    alien.pos = 10, 10    def draw():        screen.clear()        alien.draw()    def update():        alien.x += 1        if alien.left &gt; WIDTH:            alien.right = 0Installation------------See `installation instructions`__... __: http://pygame-zero.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.htmlDocumentation-------------The full documentation is at http://pygame-zero.readthedocs.org/.Read the tutorial at http://pygame-zero.readthedocs.org/en/latest/introduction.htmlfor a taste of the other things that Pygame Zero can do.Contributing------------The project is hosted on Github:https://github.com/lordmauve/pgzeroIf you want to help out with the development of Pygame Zero, you can find someinstructions on setting up a development version in the docs:http://pygame-zero.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html</longdescription>
