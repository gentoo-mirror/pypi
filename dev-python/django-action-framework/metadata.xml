	<longdescription>django-action-framework#######################``django-action-framework`` (``daf``) provides the ability to generatea number of diverse interfaces from a single action definition. What isan action? It's a function. By writing a function and providing a fewhints about the characteristics of your function, you can:1. Generate a form view from the function with proper form validation.2. Generate an update view on a model object that is passed to the function.3. Generate a bulk update view on multiple objects. These objects can   be parametrized over a function expecting one object, meaning your detail   and bulk views share the same code when desired.4. Generate wizard views to collect function arguments over multiple steps,   even if the steps are conditional.5. Natively integrate these views into the Django admin as model, detail,   or bulk actions.6. Generate Django Rest Framework actions on your viewsets.``daf`` removes the boilerplate and cognitive overhead of maintaining validationlogic, view logic, and update logic spread across Django views, models, admininterfaces, API endpoints, and other locations in a Django project. ``daf``allows the engineer to focus on writing one clear and easily-testable piece ofbusiness logic while treating complex UI and APIs as an extension of thefunction rather than a piece of intertwined code.For examples and a full tutorial of how to use ``django-action-framework``,check out the `docs &lt;https://django-action-framework.readthedocs.io/&gt;`__.Documentation=============`View the django-action-framework docs here&lt;https://django-action-framework.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_.Installation============Install django-action-framework with::    pip3 install django-action-frameworkAfter this, add ``daf`` to the ``INSTALLED_APPS``setting of your Django project.Also ensure the following apps are in ``INSTALLED_APPS``:- ``django.contrib.admin``- ``django.contrib.auth``- ``django.contrib.contenttypes``- ``django.contrib.humanize``- ``django.contrib.staticfiles``Contributing Guide==================For information on setting up django-action-framework for development andcontributing changes, view `CONTRIBUTING.rst &lt;CONTRIBUTING.rst&gt;`_.Primary Authors===============- @wesleykendall (Wes Kendall)- @romansul (Roman Sul)- @chang-brian (Brian Chang)</longdescription>
