	<longdescription># nicett6An asyncio based package to talk to a Nice TT6 control unit for tubular motors using the RS-232 protocolThe Nice TT6 control unit is used to control projector screens, garage doors, awnings and blinds.   It is white labelled by Screen Research as the MCS-N-12V-RS232 projector screen controller and by Beamax as the 11299 projector screen controller.See [this document](https://www.niceforyou.com/sites/default/files/upload/manuals/IS0064A00MM.pdf) for the protocol definitionKnown to work with a GANA USB to RS-232 DB9 cable on Windows 10 and on Raspbian Stretch# Contents* [Basic Control API](#Basic-Control-API)* [High Level Cover API](#High-Level-Cover-API)* [High Level CIW API](#High-Level-CIW-API) (to manage a Constant Image Width configuration with a screen and a mask)* [Emulator](#Emulator)* [Examples](#Examples)* [Notes](#Notes)# Basic Control API## Opening a connection`open_connection([serial_port])`Opens a connection to the TT6 controlled connected to `serial_port`If `serial_port` is not supplied or is `None` then an intelligent guess will be made as to the right parameter depending on the platformThe serial_port parameter can be anything that can be passed to `serial.serial_for_url()`.  E.g.* `/dev/ttyUSB0` (Linux)* `COM3` (Windows)* `socket://192.168.0.100:50000` (if you are using a TCP/IP to serial  converter)Returns an async context managed `MultiPlexerSerialConnection`Example:```python    async with open_connection(serial_port) as conn:        tt_addr = TTBusDeviceAddress(0x02, 0x04)        writer = conn.get_writer()        await writer.send_hex_move_command(tt_addr, 0xE0)```## MultiPlexerSerialConnectionA class that allows multiple readers and writers to a single serial connection.Created by `open_connection([serial_port])`.   See [Opening a connection](#opening-a-connection).Method|Description--|--`MultiPlexerSerialConnection.add_reader()`|Returns a new reader object.&lt;br&gt;If the connection was created by `open_connection` then this will be a `TT6Reader` object, derived from `MultiplexerReader`.&lt;br&gt;The serial connection retains a weak reference to the reader in order to keep it updated.  A reader that is no longer needed can either be dereferenced or explicitly removed.`MultiPlexerSerialConnection.remove_reader(reader)`|Stops the `reader` object from receiving any further messages`MultiPlexerSerialConnection.get_writer()`|Returns a new writer object.   If the connection was created by `open_connection` then this will be a `TT6Writer` object, derived from `MultiplexerWriter`.&lt;br&gt;The base class manages contention between multiple potential clients of the same connection.&lt;br&gt;Writer objects do not take any resources and can simply be dereferenced when finished with## TTBusDeviceAddressA simple class that represents the address of a TTBus device - to be used for `tt_addr` paramtersSupports comparison with other objects of the same classCan be used as a key in a mapping typeProperty|Description--|--`address`|the address of the device on the TTBus`node`|the device node (usually 0x04)`as_tuple`|a tuple of `(address, node)`&lt;br&gt;Example:```pythontt_addr = TTBusDeviceAddress(0x02, 0x04)```## TT6ReaderA reader that will collect all decoded messages received on the `MultiPlexerSerialConnection` in a queue until it is removedA `TT6Reader` is an asynchronous iterator returning [response message objects](#Response-message-classes)Usage:```python    async for msg in reader:        # Do something with msg```## Response message classes### AckResponseSent by the controller to acknowledge receipt of a simple commandProperty|Description--|--`tt_addr`|the `TTBusDeviceAddress` of the TTBus device`cmd_code`|the command being acknowledged### HexPosResponseSent by the controller in response to a `READ_POS` commandProperty|Description--|--`tt_addr`|the `TTBusDeviceAddress` of the TTBus device`cmd_code`|the command being acknowledged`hex_pos`|the position as a value between 0x00 (fully down/open) and 0xFF (fully up/closed)### PctPosResponseSent by the controller in response to a &quot;web position request&quot;Property|Description--|--`tt_addr`|the `TTBusDeviceAddress` of the TTBus device`pct_pos`|the position as a value between 0.0 (fully down/open) and 1.0 (fully up/closed)### InformationalResponseAn informational response from the controllerTypically used to acknowledge a non-device-specific command such as `WEB_ON` or `WEB_OFF`Property|Description--|--`info`|the informational message### ErrorResponseAn error response from the controllerProperty|Description--|--`error`|the error message## TT6WriterMethod|Description--|--`TT6Writer.send_web_on()`|Send the WEB_ON command to the controller to enable web commands and to instruct the controller to send the motor positions as they move`TT6Writer.send_web_off()`|Send the WEB_OFF command to the controller to disable web commands and to instruct the controller not to send the motor positions as they move`TT6Writer.send_simple_command(tt_addr, cmd_code)`|Send `cmd_code` to the TTBus device at `tt_addr`&lt;br&gt;See the table below for a list of all valid `cmd_code` values`TT6Writer.send_hex_move_command(tt_addr, hex_pos)`|Instruct the controller to move the TTBus device at `tt_addr` to `hex_pos`&lt;br&gt;`hex_pos` is a value between 0x00 (fully down/open) and 0xFF (fully up/closed)`TT6Writer.send_web_move_command(tt_addr, pct_pos)`|Instruct the controller to move the TTBus device at `tt_addr` to `pct_pos`&lt;br&gt;`pct_pos` is a value between 0.0 (fully down/open) and 1.0 (fully up/closed)&lt;br&gt;Out of range values for `pct_pos` will be rounded up or down accordingly&lt;br&gt;Web commands must be enabled for this command to work`TT6Writer.send_web_pos_request(tt_addr)`|Send a request to the controller to send the position of the TTBus device at `tt_addr`&lt;br&gt;Web commands must be enabled for this command to work`TT6Writer.process_request(coro, [time_window])`|Send a command and collect the response messages that arrive in time_window&lt;br&gt;Command codes for `send_simple_command`:Code|Meaning--|--`READ_POS`|Request the current position&lt;br&gt;Controller will send a value between 0x00 (fully down/open) and 0xFF (fully up/closed) `STOP`|Stop`MOVE_DOWN`|Move down`MOVE_UP`|Move up`MOVE_POS_&lt;n&gt;`|Move to preset `n` where `n` is between 1 and 6`STORE_POS_&lt;n&gt;`|Store current position to preset `n` where `n` is between 1 and 6`DEL_POS_&lt;n&gt;`|Clear preset `n` where `n` is between 1 and 6`MOVE_DOWN_STEP`|Move down the smallest possible step (web pos is not reported by controller)`MOVE_UP_STEP`|Move up the smallest possible step (web pos is not reported by controller)`STORE_UPPER_LIMIT`|Store current position to upper limit (BEWARE!)`STORE_LOWER_LIMIT`|Store current position to lower limit (BEWARE!)`DEL_UPPER_LIMIT`|Clear upper limit (BEWARE!)`DEL_LOWER_LIMIT`|Clear lower limit (BEWARE!)&lt;br&gt;Usage:```python    writer = conn.get_writer()    writer.send_web_move_command(1.0)```Usage of `process_request()`:```python    coro = writer.send_simple_command(tt_addr, &quot;READ_POS&quot;)    messages = await writer.process_request(coro)```Note that there could be unrelated messages received if web commands are enabled or if another command has just been submitted# High level Cover APIA set of components to provide a high level interface to manage a Cover.

The `Cover` infers that there is movement when a message is received and infers the direction from the current and previous message.   However, there is no notification that the `Cover` is idle so the `PostMovementNotifier` class detects that there has been no movement for a period and then calls `Cover.set_idle()`.  The `Cover` will then notify its observers that it is idle.The class implements the `AsyncObserver` interface and is intended to be attached to a `Cover`.  Whenever the `Cover` moves it calls `notifyObservers()` which calls `PostMovementNotifier.update()`.  A task is created that will wait for a period and then set the `Cover` to idle.   If a task was already running when the movement notification is received then the task will be cancelled and restarted.The task must sleep for `Cover.MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD_INTERVAL + PostMovementNotifier.POST_MOVEMENT_ALLOWANCE` seconds without being cancelled for the `Cover` to be considered idle.# High level CIW APIA high level API to manage a Constant Image Width retractable

shows how to use the [High Level Cover API](#High-Level-Cover-API)# Utilities## Movement Timing LoggerThe script `movement_timing_logger.py` can be used to see how often the controller publishes POS messages as it moves.   It will move the specified Cover down and then back up and log the time between messages.   This can be used to tune `Cover.MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD_INTERVAL` so that `Cover.is_moving` is accurate.```usage: movement_timing_logger.py [-h] [-s SERIAL_PORT] [-a {2,3}]optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -s SERIAL_PORT, --serial_port SERIAL_PORT                        serial port  -a {2,3}, --address {2,3}                        device address```# Notes## End of Line (EOL) charactersThe protocol definition specifies that all messages end in a carriage return character but in practice the controller seems to use carriage return plus line feed.For convenience the API can handle either.* The API will write to the controller with messages ending in carriage return* The API will handle messages from the controller with either line ending* The emulator will handle inbound commands with either line ending* The emulator will send responses ending in carriage return and line feed## Measurement unitsThis document refers to metres as the unit of measurement for all absolute measurements but you can use mm, cm, inches or feet as long as you are consistent</longdescription>
