	<longdescription># Flake518A small wrapper around the famous [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) tool empowering it to readthe configuration not from `setup.cfg`, `tox.ini` or `.flake8`, but from the [PEP518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/)compliant `pyproject.toml`.In contrast to [flake9](https://gitlab.com/retnikt/flake9) it is not a fork of flake8. It uses flake8 under the hood and transformsthe relevant configuration to a flake8 configuration file. This way, the ongoing implementation of flake8 can be used.## RationaleThe usage of `pyproject.toml` is though highly anticipated by some community members, but currently [rejected](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/234) by the maintainers for an undisclosed reason. Flake9 already uses the `pyproject.toml` file, but does not incorporate later changes.Since flake8 allows to pass additional configuration files, a temporary configuration file is created. This way, the latest flake8 revision is used, but it can be configured using `pyproject.toml`.## ConfigurationAccording to PEP518, each tool may add a tool-specific table to the project configuration.```toml[tool.flake8]statistics=Trueshow-source=Truemax-line-length=79doctests=Trueexclude=[&quot;.git&quot;, &quot;__pypackages__&quot;, &quot;.vscode&quot;, &quot;.mypy_cache&quot;]```For compliance reason, the `[tool.flake518]` can be used as well.## Usage with the `pre-commit` git hooks framework`flake518` can be included as a hook for [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/).The easiest way to get started is to add this configuration to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:```yaml    -   repo: https://github.com/carstencodes/flake518        rev: ''  # pick a git hash / tag to point to        hooks:        -   id: flake518```See the [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-configyaml---hooks) for how to customize this configuration. ## LicenseLike flake8, this project is licensed under the MIT license.## ContributionsContributions welcome, feel free to submit issues and pull requests on github.Contact me, if you are using gitlab or codeberg.</longdescription>
