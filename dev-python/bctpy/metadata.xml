If you don'thave `scipy`, most functions that do not need `scipy` functionality will still work.Note that graphs must be passed in as `numpy.array` rather than `numpy.matrix`. Other constraints/edge cases of the adjacency matrices (e.g. self-loops, negative weights) behave similarly to the matlab functions.A small number of functions also depend on networkx. This notably includes Network-Based Statistic, a nonparametric test for differences in undirected weighted graphs from different populations. Ideally this dependency should be removed in the future.Nosetests is used for the test suite. The test suite is not complete.## About `bctpy` and other authorsBCT is a matlab toolbox with many graph theoretical measures off of which `bctpy`is based.  I did not write BCT (apart from small bugfixes I have submitted)and a quality of life improvements that I have taken liberties to add.With few exceptions, `bctpy` is a direct translation of matlab code to python.`bctpy` should be considered beta software, with BCT being the gold standard bycomparison. I did my best to test all functionality in `bctpy`, but much of it isarcane math that flies over the head of this humble programmer. There *are*bugs lurking in `bctpy`, the question is not whether but how many. If you locatebugs, please consider submitting pull requests.Many thanks to Stefan Fuertinger for his assistance tracking down a number ofbugs. Stefan Fuertinger has a similar software package dealing with brainnetwork functionality at http://research.mssm.edu/simonyanlab/analytical-tools/Many thanks to Chris Barnes for his assistance in documenting a number of issues and facilitating a number of test cases.Credit for writing BCT (the matlab version) goes to the following list ofauthors, especially Olaf Sporns and Mika Rubinov.- Olaf Sporns- Mikail Rubinov- Yusuke Adachi- Andrea Avena- Danielle Bassett- Richard Betzel- Joaquin Goni- Alexandros Goulas- Patric Hagmann- Christopher Honey- Martijn van den Heuvel- Rolf Kotter- Jonathan Power- Murray Shanahan- Andrew ZaleskyIn order to be a bit more compact I have removed the accreditations from thedocstrings each functions. This does not in any way mean that I wish to takecredit from the individual contributions. I have moved these accreditationsto the credits file.</longdescription>
