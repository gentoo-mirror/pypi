	<longdescription>xrayutilities=============[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/dominikkriegner/xrayutilities/_apis/build/status/dkriegner.xrayutilities?repoName=dkriegner%2Fxrayutilities&amp;branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/dominikkriegner/xrayutilities/_build/)xrayutilities is a collection of scripts used to analyze and simulate x-raydiffraction data.  It consists of a Python package and several routines codedin C. For analysis the package is especially useful for the reciprocal spaceconversion of diffraction data taken with linear and area detectors. Forsimulations code for X-ray reflectivity, kinematical and dynamical diffractionsimulation of crystal truncation rods as well as fundamental parameters powderdiffraction is included.Copyright (C) 2009-2021 Dominik Kriegner &lt;dominik.kriegner@gmail.com&gt;Copyright (C) 2009-2013 Eugen Wintersberger &lt;eugen.wintersberger@desy.de&gt;Mailing list and issue tracker------------------------------To get in touch with us or report an issue please use the mailing list(https://sourceforge.net/p/xrayutilities/mailman/xrayutilities-users/) or theGithub issue tracker (https://github.com/dkriegner/xrayutilities/issues). Whenyou want to follow announcements of major changes or new releases itsrecommended to [sign up for the mailinglist](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xrayutilities/lists/xrayutilities-users)Contents--------* *examples*:           directory with example scripts and configurations* *lib/xrayutilities*:  directory with the sources for the Python package* *tests*:              directory with the unittest scripts* *setup.py*:           setuptools install script used for the package installationInstallation (pip)==================Using the python package manager pip you can install xrayutilities by executing    pip install xrayutilitiesor for a user installation (without admin access) use    pip install --user xrayutilitiesInstallation (source)=====================Installing xrayutilities from source is an easy process done by executing    pip install .in the source folder of xrayutilities on the command line/terminal. Directlycalling *setup.py* by    python setup.py installor    python setup.py install --prefix=&lt;install_path&gt;is possible but you have to manually ensure that the dependencies are allinstalled! The first command installs xrayutilities in the systems defaultdirectories, whereas in the second command you can manually specify theinstallation path.By default the installation procedure tries to enable OpenMP support(recommended). It is disabled silently if OpenMP is not available. It can alsobe disabled by using the *--without-openmp* option for the installation:    python setup.py build_ext --without-openmp installRequirements------------The following requirements are needed for installing and using *xrayutilities*:- Python (&gt;= 3.6)- h5py- scipy (version &gt;= 0.18.0)- numpy (version &gt;= 1.9)- lmfit (&gt;= 1.0.1, optional)- matplotlib (optional, version &gt;= 3.1.0)- mayavi (optional, only used optionally in Crystal.show_unitcell)When building from source you also might need:- C-compiler (preferential with OpenMP support)- Python dev headers- setuptools- tox (optional - only if you want to run the test environment)- sphinx (optional - only when you want to build the documentation)- numpydoc (optional - only when you want to build the documentation)- rst2pdf (optional - only when you want to build the documentation)- sphinx_rtd_theme (optional - only when you want to build the documentation)- svglib (optional - only when you want to build the pdf documentation)refer to your operating system documentation to find out how to installthose packages. On Microsoft Windows refer to the Documentation for theeasiest way of the installation (Anaconda, Python(x,y), or WinPython).Python-2.7 and Python-3.X compatibility=======================================The current development is for Python3 (version &gt;=3.6) only. xrayutilities upto version 1.5.x can be used with Python-2.7 as well. Python 3.3 to 3.5 wassupported up to 1.6.0.The Python package configuration================================The following steps should only be necessary when using non-defaultinstallation locations to ensure the Python module is found by the Pythoninterpreter. In this case the module is installed under*&lt;prefix&gt;/lib[64]/python?.?/site-packages* on Unix systems and*&lt;prefix&gt;/Lib/site-packages* on Windows systems.If you have installed the Python package in a directory unknown to your Pythondistribution, you have to tell Python where to look for the Package.  There areseveral ways how to do this:- add the directory where the package is installed to your  *PYTHONPATH* environment variable.- add the path to sys.path in the *.pythonrc* file placed in your home  directory      import sys      sys.path.append(&quot;path to the xrayutilities package&quot;)- simply apply the previous method in every script where you want to  use the xrayutilities package before importing the package      import sys      sys.path.append(&quot;path to the xrayutilities package&quot;)      import xrayutilitiesObtaining the source code=========================The sources are hosted on sourceforge in git repository.Use    git clone https://github.com/dkriegner/xrayutilities.gitto clone the git repository. If you would like to have commit rightscontact one of the administrators.Update======if you already installed xrayutilities you can update it by navigating intoits source folder and obtain the new sources by ::    git pullor download the new tarball from sourceforge(https://sf.net/projects/xrayutilities) if any code changed during the update youneed to reinstall the Python package. Thats easiest achieved by    pip install .In case you are not certain about the installation location it can be determined by    python -c &quot;import xrayutilities as xu; print xu.__file__&quot;      /usr/local/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/xrayutilities/__init__.pycif the output is e.g.: */usr/local/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/xrayutilities/__init__.py*you previously installed xrayutilities in */usr/local*, which should be usedagain as install path. Use ::    pip install --prefix=&lt;path to install directory&gt; .to install the updated package.Documentation=============Documentation for xrayutilities is found on the webpagehttps://xrayutilities.sourceforge.ioThe API-documentation can also be browsed by    pydoc -p PORTin any web-browser, after the installation is finished.</longdescription>
