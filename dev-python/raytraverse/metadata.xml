Built around a waveletguided adaptive sampling strategy, raytraverse can fully explore the daylightconditions throughout a space with efficient use of processing power andstorage space. The code base has been split into three seperate packages: thisone as well as two others that provide much of the backend functionality.craytraverse (https://pypi.org/project/craytraverse) is doccumented here andcontains code to run radiance simulations from within python. raytools isdocumented here: https://raytools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ and contains a lotof the library functions with working with hdr and ray based data. It is its'own repository because it includes stand alone tools for evaluating hdr imagesfor glare metrics.* Free software: Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0)* Documentation: https://raytraverse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.Installation------------The easiest way to install raytraverse is with pip::    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel    pip install raytraverseor if you have cloned this repository::    cd path/to/this/file    pip install .while raytraverse installs with the necessary essentials of radiance, it isrecommended to also install radiance (see: https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/Radiance/releasesand make sure you or the installer also sets the $RAYPATH variable) this isespecially important if your material or light source definitions rely on .calfiles distributed with radiance, such as perezlum.cal, window.cal, etc.Missing .cal files or other scene errors can cause raytraverse traverse toabort with cryptic eror messages (the number value is not meaningful and will bedifferent every time)::    python: : Unknown error -1624667552If you encounter such an error, make sure your scene is valid in your currentenvironment, using rvu, rpict, or rtrace.Windows~~~~~~~Currently raytraverse is only compatible with macOS and linux operating systems.One way to use raytraverse on a Windows machine is with Docker. In adddition to the Dockerinstallation, this process will require about 2.5 GB of disk space.1. Install Docker from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/   (click on &quot;Windows&quot;) and then follow the installation instructions.2. Open the newly installed Docker Desktop application (you do not need to sign in or create an account)3. In an empty directory make a file called Dockerfile_first with the following contents::    # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1    # docker build -f Dockerfile_first . --tag raytraverse:latest    FROM python:3.9    WORKDIR /build    RUN apt-get update    RUN apt-get -y install man    SHELL [&quot;/bin/bash&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;]    RUN pip3 install raytraverse    RUN curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/LBNL-ETA/Radiance/releases\?per_page\=1 \    | grep &quot;browser_download_url.*Linux.zip&quot; | cut -d: -f2,3 | tr -d \&quot; | wget -i -    RUN unzip Radiance_*_Linux.zip    RUN tar -xzf radiance-*-Linux.tar.gz    WORKDIR /radiance    RUN rm -rf bin lib man    RUN mv /build/radiance-*-Linux/usr/local/radiance/* ./    RUN rm -rf /build    ENV RAYPATH=.:/radiance/lib    ENV MANPATH=/radiance/man    ENV PATH=/radiance/bin:$PATH    RUN raytraverse --help    WORKDIR /working4. in a command prompt navigate to this folder and run the following to create   a docker image with raytraverse and radiance installed::docker build - --tag raytraverse:latest &lt; Dockerfile_first5. To use raytraverse, navigate to a local folder that contains all necessary   files (radiance scene files, sky data, etc.).6. Now, in this folder (note that you may need to change the syntax of &quot;$(pwd)&quot;   to be compatible with your shell, this works with the basic windows command prompt)::docker run -it --name rayt --mount type=bind,source=&quot;$(pwd)&quot;,target=/working raytraverse /bin/bash7. You now have a linux/bash command prompt in an environment with raytraverse, radiance, and python 3.9   installed. The currrent directory will be named &quot;working&quot; within the linux environment   and is a shared resource with the host (changes on the host side are immediately seen in the container and vice   versa). When you are finished, exit the linux shell (&quot;exit&quot;), then in the (now) windows command prompt::docker rm rayt8. for ease of use, you can put these to lines in a .bat file somewhere in your execution PATH,   just make sure that docker desktop is running before calling::docker run -it --name rayt --mount type=bind,source=&quot;$(pwd)&quot;,target=/working raytraverse /bin/bashdocker rm rayt9. to update raytraverse, the process is similar to step 4,   but with a slightly different dockerfile::# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1# docker build -f Dockerfile_update . --tag raytraverse:latestFROM raytraverse:latestWORKDIR /buildSHELL [&quot;/bin/bash&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;]RUN pip3 install --upgrade --no-deps craytraverseRUN pip3 install --upgrade --no-deps claspRUN pip3

see the Docker settings for information about resource allocation to the docker container.Usage-----raytraverse includes a complete command line interface with all commandsnested under the `raytraverse` parent command enter::    raytraverse --helpraytraverse also exposes an object oriented API written primarily in python.calls to Radiance are made through Renderer objects that wrap the radiancec source code in c++ classes, which are made available in python with pybind11.see craytraverse (https://pypi.org/project/craytraverse/).For complete documentation of the API and the command line interface eitheruse the Documentation link included above or::    pip install -r docs/requirements.txt    make docsto generate local documentation.=======History=======1.4.2

and fix double counting image when rough specular gets re-samples* new factoring with craytraverse / renderer inheritance fixes rcontrib reset1.3.6 (2022-07-28)------------------* add scale to sensor integrator forr proper unit conversion (lux by default)* parallel processing in zonallightresult.pull2hdr* add lightresult.pull2planhdr to match signature of zonallightresult* add

sampled suns and level 0 distance of areas  for level 0 sampled suns* SensorIntegrator to process sensorplane results* manage stranded open OS file descriptors* wait to calculate omega on demand in lightplaneKD* removed img2lf in imagetools, creates circular reference, need to add to different module* allow None vector argument for lightplane initialization (cconstructs filename)* zero pad hour labels in lightresult for proper file name sorting* calc_omega method now passes &quot;QJ&quot; to qhull which seems to reliable return regions for all points  in case of failure, distributed area

can now control logging and pbars with scene parameter1.2.6 (2022-02-19)------------------* add hours when available to skydata* proper masking of 360 images* integratorDS handles stray roughness from direct patch* planmapper, z set to median instead of max, added autorotation/alignment* bugs/features/consistency in LightResult, need better usage documentation* directviews from cli (only works with sky)1.2.5 (2022-02-15)------------------* integrated zonal calcs in cli* fall back to regular light result when possible (but keep area)* fixed bugs in LightResult, ZonalLightResult* added physically

2022-02-10)------------------------------------------------* organized command line code* use process pool for sun sampler when raytracing is fast (such as -ab 0 runs with dcomp)* propogate plotp to child sampler if sampling one level* separated utility command line to own entry point. fixed ambiguity in  coordinate handedness of some functions (changed kwarg defaults)1.2.3
