	<longdescription>Priority Queue Dictionary (pqdict)==================================A priority queue dictionary maps hashable objects (keys) to priority-determining values. It provides a hybrid dictionary/priority queue API. Works with Python 2.7+, 3.4+, and PyPy... image:: https://travis-ci.org/nvictus/priority-queue-dictionary.png?branch=master       :target: https://travis-ci.org/nvictus/priority-queue-dictionary    :alt: CI Build State.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/pqdict/badge/?version=latest    :target: https://readthedocs.org/projects/pqdict/    :alt: Documentation Status.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pqdict.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pqdictThe priority queue is implemented as a binary heap of (key, priority value)pairs, which supports:- O(1) search for the item with highest priority- O(log n) removal of the item with highest priority- O(log n) insertion of a new itemAdditionally, an index maps elements to their location in the heap and is keptup to date as the heap is manipulated. As a result, pqdict also supports:- O(1) lookup of any item by key- O(log n) removal of any item- O(log n) updating of any item's priority levelDocumentation-------------Documentation is available at http://pqdict.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.License -------This module is released under the MIT license. The augmented heap implementation was adapted from the ``heapq`` module in the Python standard library, which was written by Kevin O'Connor and augmented by Tim Peters and Raymond Hettinger.</longdescription>
