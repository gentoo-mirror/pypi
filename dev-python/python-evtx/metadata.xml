	<longdescription>python-evtx is a pure Python parser for Windows Event Log files (those with the file extension &quot;.evtx&quot;). The module provides programmatic access to the File and Chunk headers, record templates, and event entries. For example, you can use python-evtx to review the event logs of Windows 7 systems from a Mac or Linux workstation. The structure definitions and parsing strategies were heavily inspired by the work of Andreas Schuster and his Perl implementation &quot;Parse-Evtx&quot;.</longdescription>
