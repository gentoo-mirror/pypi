	<longdescription># Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit (BQSKit)The Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit (BQSKit) \[bis â€¢ kit\] is a powerfuland portable quantum compiler framework. It can be used with ease to compilequantum programs to efficient physical circuits for any QPU.## InstallationBQSKit is available for Python 3.8+ on Linux, macOS, and Windows. BQSKitand its dependencies are listed on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org),and as such, pip can easily install it:```shpip install bqskit```## Basic UsageA standard BQSKit workflow loads a program into the framework, models thetarget QPU, compiles the program, and exports the resulting circuit. Thebelow example uses BQSKit to optimize an input circuit provided by a qasmfile:```pythonfrom bqskit import compile, Circuit# Load a circuit from QASMcircuit = Circuit.from_file(&quot;input.qasm&quot;)# Compile the circuitcompiled_circuit = compile(circuit)# Save output as QASMcompiled_circuit.save(&quot;output.qasm&quot;)```To learn more about BQSKit, follow the[tutorial series](https://github.com/BQSKit/bqskit-tutorial/) or refer tothe [documentation](https://bqskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).## How to CiteYou can use the [software disclosure](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1785933)to cite the BQSKit package.Additionally, if you used or extended a specific algorithm, you should citethat individually.
