	<longdescription>joca====Jira On Call AssigneeCheck an ical url (files not supported yet) for current on call.`PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/joca/&gt;`__Installation============::   pip install jocaConfiguration file==================The configuration holds 3 sections, ``local``, ``jira`` and``projects``.-  ``local`` is for configuring logging.-  ``jira`` houses the username, password and server url of the Jira   instance joca connects to.-  ``projects`` is a list of objects that tell joca what project, what   ical and the regex to apply to the event summary to extract the users   name.Here is a basic configuration:::   {       &quot;local&quot;: {           &quot;logging&quot;: {               &quot;file&quot;: &quot;/var/log/joca.log&quot;,               &quot;format&quot;: &quot;%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s&quot;,               &quot;level&quot;: &quot;info&quot;           },       },       &quot;jira&quot;: {           &quot;server&quot;: &quot;https://instance.jira.com&quot;,           &quot;username&quot;: &quot;api-user&quot;,           &quot;password&quot;: &quot;hunter2&quot;       },       &quot;projects&quot;: [           {               &quot;key&quot;: &quot;PROJ&quot;,               &quot;ical&quot;: &quot;https://totally.a-website.com/calendar&quot;,               &quot;regex&quot;: &quot;^(.*)$&quot;           }       ]   }-  ``local.logging``, ``format`` is not required.-  ``local.logging.level`` doesn’t need to be uppercase.-  ``projects.#.key`` doesn’t have to be uppercase, joca will handle   that.``projects`` is a list, so feel free to have multiple projects set up,and it will loop over them.To do=====Check out todo.txt for the basic list of to-do’s.todo.txt follows the syntax rules laid out`here &lt;https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt&gt;`__.Version Numbering=================joca follows the three major tenets of`SemVer &lt;https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html&gt;`__.   Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:   -  MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,   -  MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible      manner, and   -  PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.   Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as   extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format. (Preston-Warner, 2013)Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dotseparated identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-releaseversion.Build version follows `RFC-1912 section2.2 &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1912#section-2.2&gt;`__:   The recommended syntax is YYYYMMDDnn (YYYY=year, MM=month, DD=day,   nn=revision number. This won’t overflow until the year 4294&quot; (Barr,   1996)Example: ``1.23.4-2018033000``:-  Major version ``1``-  Minor version ``23``-  Patch version ``4``-  Build number ``2018033000`` =&gt; ``2018`` ``03`` ``30`` ``00``Please read the full spec at the link above or in the citations.Exit codes==========Exit/Error codes use the best approximation from ``errno.h``.+------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------+| Code | errno.h         | joca usage                                 |+======+=================+============================================+| 2    | ENOENT          | The file does not exist.                   |+------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------+| 5    | EIO             | The output was not expected.               |+------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------+| 13   | EACCES          | Jira returned a 401 Not Authorized.        |+------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------+| 22   | EINVAL          | Supposed Lead cannot be made Project Lead. |+------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------+| 43   | EPROTONOSUPPORT | File failed schema validation.             |+------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------+| 78   | ENOSYS          | Required import is not installed.          |+------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------+Copyright=========   JOCA – Jira On Call Assignee – Change project lead based on an ical   event.
