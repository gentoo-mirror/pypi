	<longdescription>IPython provides a rich toolkit to help you make the most out of using Pythoninteractively.  Its main components are: * A powerful interactive Python shell * A `Jupyter &lt;https://jupyter.org/&gt;`_ kernel to work with Python code in Jupyter   notebooks and other interactive frontends.The enhanced interactive Python shells have the following main features: * Comprehensive object introspection. * Input history, persistent across sessions. * Caching of output results during a session with automatically generated   references. * Extensible tab completion, with support by default for completion of python   variables and keywords, filenames and function keywords. * Extensible system of 'magic' commands for controlling the environment and   performing many tasks related either to IPython or the operating system. * A rich configuration system with easy switching between different setups   (simpler than changing $PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables every time). * Session logging and reloading. * Extensible syntax processing for special purpose situations. * Access to the system shell with user-extensible alias system. * Easily embeddable in other Python programs and GUIs. * Integrated access to the pdb debugger and the Python profiler.The latest development version is always available from IPython's `GitHubsite &lt;http://github.com/ipython&gt;`_.</longdescription>
