	<longdescription>Grow is a fresh, declarative, file-based static site generator for rapidmicrosite production. Learn more at https://grow.dev.Key features:- Data-driven: All your content is stored in YAML or Markdown, keeping content  separate from presentation. Architect your site structure in YAML, then bind  data to HTML templates to build your pages entirely around data from data  files.- Flexible URLs: Grow supports an explicit, configurable way to generate URLs  for your site. Use template tags to keep your site maintainable and URL  changes easy.- Internationalization: Grow comes with flexible internationalization support  included. Tag strings for translation, localize your content, and easily  add/remove locales on a site-wide or per-document basis.- Deploy anywhere: Grow builds your site to a static fileset, which means you  can deploy pretty much anywhere. Grow comes built-in with deploy targets to  various services.To learn about contributing and to see the source code:https://github.com/grow/grow.</longdescription>
