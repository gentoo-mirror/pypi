	<longdescription># GeoGIF[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/geogif/badge/?version=latest)](https://geogif.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)Make GIFs from time-stacked `xarray.DataArray`s (`time`, [optional `band`], `y`, `x`), dead-simple.```pythonfrom geogif import gif, dgifgif(data_array)dgif(dask_data_array).compute()```![Animation of shoreline moving on the coast of Cape Cod](docs/capecod.gif)The &quot;geo&quot; part is a lie, actually. The arrays don't have to be geospatial in nature. But I called it GeoGIF because:1. Wanting to animate a time-stack of imagery (like you'd get from [stackstac](https://stackstac.readthedocs.io/)) is a common task in the earth-observation/geospatial world.1. I think `GeoGIF` is a hilarious idea&lt;sup&gt;[1](#geotiff)&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;a name=&quot;geotiff&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;: To ruin the joke, it sounds like GeoTIFF, a ubiquitous geospatial image format. If you also think this is a funny idea, and believe you'd have a better use for the name than I do, I'd happily cede it to you.## Installation```bashpip install geogif```## DocumentationSee https://geogif.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.## DevelopmentGeoGIF is managed by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), so be sure that's installed first. To develop locally, first fork or clone the repo. Then, to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies:```bashcd geogifpoetry install```### Running TestsGeoGIF has some basic end-to-end tests, written with [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). To run:```bashpytest```This will take ~30 seconds (longer the first time), as Hypothesis generates fake data to root out possible errors.### Code styleGeoGIF is formatted with [shed](https://github.com/Zac-HD/shed), in order to allow for as few opinions as possible.</longdescription>
