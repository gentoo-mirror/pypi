	<longdescription>=========os-xenapi=========XenAPI library for OpenStack projectsThis library provides the support functions needed to connect to and manage a XenAPI-basedhypervisor, such as Citrix's XenServer.* Free software: Apache license* Source: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/os-xenapi* Bugs: http://bugs.launchpad.net/os-xenapi* Install Devstack on XenServer: https://github.com/openstack/os-xenapi/blob/master/tools/README.rstFeatures--------The following features are supported since 0.3.1:* VDI streaming  It will allow the library user to create XenServer VDI from a gzipped  image data stream; or create gzipped image data stream from a specified  XenServer VDI. By comparing to the existing dom0 glance plugin, the  image data gets processed on the fly via streams. So it doesn't create  intermediate files. And it completely uses the formal VDI import or  export APIs when it exchanges VDI data with XenServer.* XAPI pool  With this feature, we can deploy OpenStack on hosts which belong to a  XAPI pool, so that we can get the benefits from XAPI pool features:  e.g. it's able to live migrate instance between two hosts without  moving the disks on shared storage.The following features are supported since 0.3.2:* Bootstrap compute node via a single command  Now we can support to boostrap an OpenStack compute node by running the  command of ``xenapi_bootstrap`` from a VM which is running on XenServer.  At the moment, only CentOS 7.x is supported.</longdescription>
