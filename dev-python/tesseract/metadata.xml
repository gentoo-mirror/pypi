	<longdescription>The TesseRACt package is designed to compute concentrations of simulated darkmatter halos from volume info for particles generated using Voronoi tesselation.This technique is advantageous as it is non-parametric, does not assume spherical symmetry, and allows for the presence of substructure. For a morecomplete description of this technique including a comparison to other techniques for calculating concentration, please see the accompanying paper `Lang et al. (2015) &lt;http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04307&gt;`_.This package includes: * **vorovol**: C program for computing the Voronoi diagram of particle data in a number of formats including Gadget-2, Gasoline, binary, and ASCII as well as BGC2 halo catalogues. * routines for compiling, running, and parsing **vorovol** output * routines for computing concentrations using particles volumes, traditional fitting to an NFW profile, and non-parametric techniques that assume spherical symmetry. * routines and test halos for running many of the performance tests presented in `Lang et al. (2015) &lt;http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04307&gt;`_.Below are some useful links associated with TesseRACt: * `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tesseract&gt;`_ - The most recent stable release. * `Docs &lt;http://pytesseract.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&gt;`_ - Tutorials and descriptions of the package modules and functions. * `Lang et al.
