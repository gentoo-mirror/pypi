	<longdescription># SAMBA (Smoothed imAge MicroBiome distAnce) This code is attached to the paper &quot;SAMBA: A Novel Smoothed Image-Based Metric for Microbial Sequencing Data Analysis&quot;. SAMBA is a novel microbial metric. SAMBA utilizes the iMic method to transform microbial data into images, incorporating phylogenetic structure and abundance similarity. This image-based representation enhances data visualization and analysis. Moreover, SAMBA employs a fast Fourier transform (FFT) with adjustable thresholding to smooth the images,reducing noise and accentuating meaningful information. Various distance metrics, such as SAM and MSE, can be applied to the processed images.## How to apply SAMBASAMBA's code is available at this [GitHub](https://github.com/oshritshtossel/SAMBA/new/master?readme=1) as well as [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/samba-metric/).### SAMBA's GitHubThere is an example in example_use.py.You should follow the following steps:1. Load the raw ASVs table in the following format: the first column names &quot;ID&quot;,   each row represents a sample and each column represents an ASV. The last row    contains the taxonomy information, names &quot;taxonomy&quot;.       ```    df = pd.read_csv(&quot;example_data/for_preprocess.csv&quot;)    ```   2. Apply the MIPMLP with the defaulting parameters (see [MIPMLP](https://pypi.org/project/MIPMLP/) for more explanations).    ```    processed = MIPMLP.preprocess(df)    ```    3. micro2matrix (translate microbiome into matrix according to [iMic](https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2023.2224474), and save the images in a prepared folder      ```    folder = &quot;example_data/2D_images&quot;    micro2matrix(processed, folder, save=True)    ```    4. Calculate the distance matrix according to SAMBA   One can choose the FFT cutoff (in the range of [0,1]), and the final metric (one of &quot;sam&quot;,&quot;mse&quot;,&quot;d1&quot;,&quot;d2&quot;,&quot;d3&quot;).      ```    DM = build_SAMBA_distance_matrix(folder,cutoff=CUTOFF,metric=METRIC)    ```### SAMBA's Pypi1. Pip install the package```pip install samba-metric```3. Apply SAMBA on a MIPMLP processed data:```from samba import *processed = pd.read_csv(&quot;example_data.csv&quot;,index_col=0)folder = &quot;FOLDER_NAME&quot;micro2matrix(processed, folder, save=True)# Calculate the distance matrix according to SAMBADM = build_SAMBA_distance_matrix(folder)DM.to_csv(f&quot;{folder}/samba_dists.csv&quot;)```        </longdescription>
