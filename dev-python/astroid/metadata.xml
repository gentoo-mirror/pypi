Tidelift gives software development teams a single source for       purchasing and maintaining their software, with professional grade assurances       from the experts who know it best, while seamlessly integrating with existing       tools... _Tidelift Subscription: https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-astroid?utm_source=pypi-astroid&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=readmeWhat's this?------------The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation ofpython source code. It is currently the library powering pylint's capabilities.It provides a compatible representation which comes from the `_ast`module.  It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module byrecursively walking down the AST and building an extended ast. The newnode classes have additional methods and attributes for differentusages. They include some support for static inference and local namescopes. Furthermore, astroid can also build partial trees by inspecting livingobjects.Installation------------Extract the tarball, jump into the created directory and run::    pip install .If you want to do an editable installation, you can run::    pip install -e .If you have any questions, please mail the code-quality@python.orgmailing list for support. Seehttp://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/code-quality for subscriptioninformation and archives.Documentation-------------http://astroid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python Versions---------------astroid 2.0 is currently available for Python 3 only.
