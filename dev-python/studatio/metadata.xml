	<longdescription># studatio![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/studatio)`studatio` is a Python tool for private music teachers to manage their studio's data.I am primarily developing this for my own use as a violin teacher. However, I hope for the project to become useful toother teachers. Currently, studatio pulls and formats Apple iCal data about music lessons for use in lesson schedules orfacility reservations.I hope to add support for automated facility reservations, expanded business statistics, billing, and note-taking.## InstallationFirst, [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if it is not already installed. Use the packagemanager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) toinstall studatio.```bashpip install studatio```On first use, studatio will prompt you for a URL containing iCal data of your studio's calendar.## Usage```Usage: studatio schedule [OPTIONS]  Prints and copies to clipboard a formatted list of  studio events.Options:  -m, --month TEXT    Integer, or range of ints                      separated by a hyphen,                      representing a month/s of the                      year. Defaults to current                      month.  -y, --year INTEGER  Defaults to current year.``````Usage: studatio elapsed [OPTIONS]  Prints the time elapsed of events in the given  periodOptions:  -m, --month TEXT    Integer, or range of ints                      separated by a hyphen,                      representing a month/s of the                      year. Defaults to current                      month.  -y, --year INTEGER  Defaults to current year.```Examples:```% studatio schedule --month 1 --year 2022Jan 01 2022 Violin Lesson 10:45 AM to 11:45 AMJan 07 2022 Violin/Viola Lessons 04:30 PM to 06:15 PMJan 08 2022 Violin Lesson 12:30 PM to 01:30 PMJan 18 2022 Violin Lesson 06:05 PM to 06:35 PMJan 21 2022 Violin Lessons 03:30 PM to 05:30 PMJan 28 2022 Viola Lesson 05:30 PM to 06:15 PM````studatio schedule -m 10-12``% studatio elapsed --month 10 --year 202222 Hours, 0 Minutes Elapsed`## ContributingTo build, you must install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). Pull requestsare welcome. Documentation and test changes are just aswelcome as changes to source code.I am an amateur programmer, but I always want to learn, so if there are things that work but are not best practices, Iwould be eager to hear them.## License[MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)</longdescription>
