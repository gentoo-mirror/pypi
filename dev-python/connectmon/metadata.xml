	<longdescription># ConnectMonA tool for monitoring tasks and connectors in Kafka Connect. ## InstallationWith pip```pip install connectmon```With poetry```poetry add connectmon```## Usage```pyfrom connectmon import env, APIfrom connectmon.messaging import TeamsService## Setup Kafka Connect Rest API client and check if cluster is reachableconnect = API(env.CONNECT_URL)## Get all connectors and check if any are in a failed stateconnectors = connect.get_all_connectors()## Loop through all channels and send messagesfor channel in env.CHANNELS.channels:    if channel.type == &quot;teams&quot;:        service = TeamsService(connect, channel)        service.process_channel_connectors(connectors)        service.send_message()```## ConfigurationBase configuration for ConnectMon is handled through Environment Variables. ### Environment Variables| Name | Type | Description | Default ||------|------|-------------| ------- | | **CONFIG_PATH** | Optional string | The path to the channel configuration file | `&quot;&quot;` || **CONNECT_URL** | string | The URL of the Connect cluster | `&quot;http://localhost:8083&quot;` || SKIP_TLS_VERIFY | boolean | Whether to skip TLS verification | `False` || ENVIRONMENT | string | The environment the application is running in | `&quot;dev&quot;` || LOG_LEVEL | string | The log level for the application | `&quot;INFO&quot;` || LOG_FORMAT | string | The log format for the application | `&quot;(asctime)s - ...&quot;` |&gt; *Name in bold are required!*If `CONFIG_PATH` is provided, the application will attempt to loadconfiguration from the file, which will set `settings.CHANNELS` with thechannels configured in the supplied configuration file.### Channel ConfigurationYou can configure specific channels to receive notifications when connectors or tasks are paused or failed.A config file could look like this```yamlchannels:  - name: my-teams-team-name    type: teams    url: https://my-org.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/...    actions:      - RESTART_FAILED    include:      - i-want-to-monitor-this-connector      - this-too    exclude:      - who-cares-about-this-connector      - this-is-someone-elses-problem```Supported fields for channels are:| Name | Type | Description | Default || ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- || **name** | string | Name of the channel | `&quot;&quot;` || **type** | string | Type of channel | `&quot;&quot;` || **url**  | string | Url to send payload to | `&quot;&quot;` || actions | list of strings | Can be any of `RESTART_FAILED`, `RESTART_FAILED_CONNECTORS`, `RESTART_FAILED_TASKS`, `RESUME_PAUSED_CONNECTORS` | `RESTART_FAILED` || include | list of strings | Names of connectors to include for this channel | `[&quot;*&quot;]` || exclude | list of strings | Names of connectors to *exclude* for this channel | `[]` |&gt; Current only Microsoft Teams or `type: &quot;teams&quot;` is supported.</longdescription>
