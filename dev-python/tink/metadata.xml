	<longdescription># TinkUsing crypto in your application shouldn't have to feel like juggling chainsawsin the dark. Tink is a crypto library written by a group of cryptographers andsecurity engineers at Google. It was born out of our extensive experienceworking with Google's product teams, fixing weaknesses in implementations, andproviding simple APIs that can be used safely without needing a cryptobackground.Tink provides secure APIs that are easy to use correctly and hard(er) to misuse.It reduces common crypto pitfalls with user-centered design, carefulimplementation and code reviews, and extensive testing. At Google, Tink isalready being used to secure data of many products such as AdMob, Google Pay,Google Assistant, Firebase, the Android Search App, etc.## DocumentationFor an overview of using Tink in Python, see the[Python HOW-TO](../docs/PYTHON-HOWTO.md).In addition, there are illustrative [examples of using TinkPython](https://github.com/google/tink/tree/master/examples/python/) which canused as a jumping off point.</longdescription>
