Issues may arise due to too many files, access permissions, or large file sizes. Be cautious with large files as they may contain viruses. The `gdown` package offers better exception handling and compatibility.&lt;br&gt;# Installation```pip install googledriver```&lt;br&gt;# Features## 1. File Download`Download to specific path` &lt;br&gt;To save a file from a shared Google Drive URL to local storage, use the following code.```pythonfrom googledriver import downloadURL = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/xxxxxxxxx/view?usp=share_link'download(URL, './model/tf_gpt2_model')```&lt;br&gt;`Download to cached folder` &lt;br&gt;To download a cached file (or directory) from a URL and return its path, you can use the following method.```pythonfrom googledriver import downloadURL = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/xxxxxxxxx/view?usp=share_link'cached_path = download(URL, None, 'tf_model')```Basically, torch cached is used, and the huggingface hub module is used as a reference and wrapped.&lt;br&gt;## 2. Folder DownloadThe return value returns the path of the saved files. However, it is different when using it as a cache folder. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;`Download to current working directory` &lt;br&gt;```pythonfrom googledriver import download_folderURL = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/xxxxxxxxx/view?usp=share_link'download_folder(URL)```&lt;Br&gt;`Download to specific directory` &lt;br&gt;```pythonfrom googledriver import download_folderURL = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/xxxxxxxxx/view?usp=share_link'save_folder = './any/path/to/save/'download_folder(URL, save_folder)```&lt;br&gt;`Download to cached directory` &lt;br&gt;```pythonfrom googledriver import download_folderURL = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/xxxxxxxxx/view?usp=share_link'download_folder(URL, cached=True)```In the case of the cache folder, the return value is the cache folder path of Google Drive. Therefore, it may be difficult to cache and use multiple folders.&lt;br&gt;# References[1] https://github.com/huggingface/transformers &lt;br&gt;[2] https://github.com/wkentaro/gdown</longdescription>
