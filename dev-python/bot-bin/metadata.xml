	<longdescription># Bot BinShared cogs and utilities for use in Discord bots.Some cogs require bot configuration; those that do expect a `bot.config` dict attribute.## bot_bin.botContains an AutoShardedBot subclass. Contains custom error logging, customizable on_message bot ignoring,case insensitive prefixes, and database setup if the setup_db kwarg is set to True. Requires the config kwargto be set to a dict. bot.config['tokens']['discord'] should be the bot's Discord token.## bot_bin.debugContains memory usage and performance debugging commands. Most other debug functionality is already providedby [jishaku](https://pypi.org/project/jishaku/).## bot_bin.miscContains an uptime, ping, and copyright command. The latter requires bot.config['copyright_license_file'] to beset to a path to a text file, the contents of which will be sent when the user runs the copyright command.Also contains various utilities:- `codeblock` wraps text in a markdown code block- `absolute_natural_timedelta` returns an English string representing an amount of seconds- `natural_timedelta` returns an English string representing the difference between two dates.  This function differs from `absolute_natural_timedelta` in that it also supports years and months.- `natural_rate` returns an English string representing a rate of occurence.- `plural` is a format object which pluralizes strings. For example: `f'Found {plural(len(results)):weapon}'`- `natural_join` joins a sequence of strings according to English grammar- `timeit` is a context manager that times the code in the `with` block## bot_bin.sqlContains SQL execution commands for asyncpg.Requires `bot.pool` to be set to either an asyncpg Connection or a ConnectionPool.Requires the `bot_bin[sql]` extra.## bot_bin.statsImplements the guild count API for DBL, DBots, Bots For Discord, LBots, and Discord Boats.This is configured using `bot.config['tokens']['stats']`.Each key should be a domain, e.g. `bot.config['tokens']['stats']['discordbots.org']` would be the bot's DBL token.Defines a `send-stats` owner only command which sends the current guild counts to the configured APIsand reports any errors.</longdescription>
