	<longdescription># BionicBionic is a framework for analyzing and modeling data in Python.  It's designedto help you **iterate faster on your research**, and help your colleagues**reuse your code more easily**.Bionic is in alpha and evolving rapidly.  We recommend it for research projectswhere the dataset fits in memory.  We do not recommend it for pipelines runningin production.Check out the [full documentation](https://bionic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),or go straight to [GetStarted](https://bionic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/get-started.html).## InstallationBionic can be installed from PyPI:    pip install bionic[standard]You'll probably want to install [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) as well.See the [Installationdocs](https://bionic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/get-started.html#installation)for more details on installing and configuring Bionic's dependencies.## ContributingSee the[Contribution](https://bionic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributing.html)section of our docs.## LicenseCopyright 2019 Square, Inc.Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;);you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.You may obtain a copy of the License at   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, softwaredistributed under the License is distributed on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.See the License for the specific language governing permissions andlimitations under the License.</longdescription>
