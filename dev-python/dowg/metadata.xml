	<longdescription>This is an implementation of the DoWG optimization algorithm as laid out by [Khaled et al.][1]. I am unsure if the implementation is correct, and I took the liberty of creating a quantized implementation under DoWG8bit as the ordinary version absolutely gobbles up Vram.Pull requests are welcome.[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16284</longdescription>
