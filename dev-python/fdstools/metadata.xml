	<longdescription>Forensic DNA Sequencing Tools=============================Tools for filtering and interpretation of Massively Parallel Sequencing data offorensic DNA samples. To obtain a list of included tools with a briefdescription of each tool, run:    fdstools --helpFor a complete description of a specific tool and its command line arguments,run:    fdstools --help TOOLNAMEInstallation------------FDSTools requires Python version 3.5 or later.The recommended way to install FDSTools is by using the `pip` packageinstaller. If you have `pip` installed, you can easily install FDSTools byrunning the following command:    pip install -U fdstoolsAlternatively, FDSTools can be installed by running:    python setup.py installRelease Notes-------------### Version 2.0.4 (2023-03-02)Microhaplotype alleles with SNPs adjacent to any of the microhaplotypepositions are now recognised. For example, an allele previously named&quot;MH_N_123NC&gt;GA&quot; will now be named &quot;MH_G_124C&gt;A&quot; instead.Greatly improved loading speed for large library files.### Version 2.0.3 (2022-08-27)Added NimaGen IDseek OmniSTR built-in library file (ID-OmniSTR).### Version 2.0.2 (2022-07-25)Fixed a compatibility issue with Python 3.10, that caused TSSV to crash.Fixed some issues that could cause crashes in the Pipeline tool.Corrected the reported range of AmelongeninY in the ForenSeq-A and ForenSeq-Blibrary files which were introduced in v2.0.1, by adding 1 to the startingposition. The range is now identical to the UAS Flanking Region Report range.If still you need to work with data previously generated using the ForenSeq-Aor ForenSeq-B library as shipped with v2.0.1, use the Library tool to obtain acopy of the built-in library file and make sure the range of AmelongeninYstarts at 6869870.### Version 2.0.1 (2022-05-12)Added support for microhaplotype targets. For markers configured as such,the 'allelename' sequence format will look like &quot;MH_AGGTC&quot;.Added ForenSeq DNA Signature Prep Kit library files with ranges specificallyoptimized for FDSTools (often longer than UAS Flanking Region Report).### Version 2.0.0 (2021-07-15)Transition to Python 3.5, along with a major upgrade to all tools toprovide an overall better experience.Allele naming is now handled by STRNaming, eliminating the need forcomplex library files. Library files of commonly-used kits are built in.Kits that sequence a target on a single strand (such as the ForenSeq DNASignature Prep Kit by Verogen) are now supported.### Version 1.2.1 (2021-07-15)This release focuses on finishing support for Python2 before the transitionto Python3. FDSTools will now display the help page if no command is given.A message about the transition to Python3 in the next version of FDSToolsis added to the command-line help pages. Furthermore, dependency versionnumbers have been updated to ensure smooth installation on Python2 as wellas a smooth transition to Python3.### Version 1.2.0 (2019-03-29)Major improvements and fixes to the TSSV tool. Most notably, it no longerrelies on the external `tssvl` program because that is no longercompatible with FDSTools. Furthermore, the new TSSV tool v2.0.0 comes witha major performance upgrade and has some updated command-line arguments.This release also fixes an issue in Samplestats and adds the ability toapply graph filtering before noise correction in Samplevis, making theeffects of noise correction more apparent.### Version 1.1.1 (2017-03-15)Fixeds incorrect calculation of tLeft, fLeft, rLeft, tRight and fRightcolumns in the report output file of TSSV, when -T/--num-threads was set to2 or higher. The primary output was unaffected.### Version 1.1.0 (2017-03-14)In STR allele names for sequences that don't exactly match the descriptiongiven in the library file, no more insertions are produced at the end ofthe prefix or the beginning of the suffix, in favour of extra STR blocks.Empty input files and broken pipelines are now handled gracefully acrossall tools. Specifically, an empty input file is now treated as if theexpected columns existed, but no lines of actual data were present. Thisgreatly helps in tracking down issues in pipelines involving multipletools, as tools will now shutdown gracefully if an upstream tool fails towrite output. Only the failing tool will output an error.Furthermore, a new option has been added to the TSSV tool, enablingmultithreading support. This can greatly reduce analysis time by usingmore (or all) cores of the system's processor simultaneously.Finally, various small bugs and glitches were fixed.### Version 1.0.1 (2016-12-21)FDSTools library files may now contain IUPAC ambiguous bases in the prefixprefix and suffix sequences of STR markers (except the first sequence, asit is used as the reference). Additionally, optional bases may berepresented by lowercase letters.An option was added to the Pipeline tool to skip running Allelefinder,using a user-supplied allele list file instead. Multiple options have beenadded to the Vis tool and some have been regrouped to more easily find theoption you are looking for.It is now possible to save the a Samplevis HTML visualisation after havingmade changes, preserving the changes made.And various minor bug fixes and improvements throughout.### Version 1.0.0 (2016-10-03)Fixed an issue with variant descriptions in allele names of non-STR markersthat made it impossible to convert those back to raw sequences.Added various useful options. Most notably, Samplevis now displays atooltip when the mouse pointer is over an allele, providing various detailsabout that allele.And various minor bug fixes.### Version 0.0.5 (2016-09-06)Added the Library tool, for creating a template library file that includeshelpful commentary and examples to get new users started. Creating an emptylibrary file used to be a somewhat confusing option in the Libconvert tool.Also, the Blame tool was replaced with the more advanced BGAnalyse tool.Added the Pipeline tool, which implements some ready-made pipelinesinvolving most of the other tools in FDSTools. Three pipelines areprovided: one for noise reference sample analysis, one for case sampleanalysis, and one for generating a background noise database from thereference samples.In Samplestats, the default allele calling option thresholds have changed:    - Changed default value of -m/--min-pct-of-max from 5.0 to 2.0    - Changed default value of -p/--min-pct-of-sum from 3.0 to 1.5The TSSV tool was updated with an option to increase the penalty given toinsertions and deletions in the flanking sequences. It now requires TSSVversion 0.4.0 to be installed.Various upgrades to visualisations, bringing a new responsive design to allHTML visualisations and fixing various issues.### Version 0.0.4 (2016-07-26)Improved debugging: FDSTools will now print profiling information to stdoutwhen the -d/--debug option was specified. Also, all tools now correctlyinterpret '-' as the output filename as 'write to standard out'.BGEstimate has gained a new option to require a minimum number of uniquegenotypes in which a specific allele must have been seen before it will beconsidered for noise estimation. This is to avoid 'contamination' of thenoise profile of one allele with the noise of another. If homozygoussamples are available for an allele, this filter is not applied to thatallele.Reduced the memory usage of BGPredict and BGMerge. Also, BGPredict will nowoutput nonzero values below the threshold set by -n/--min-pct if thepredicted noise ratio of the same stutter on the other strand is above thethreshold. Previously, values below the threshold were clipped to zero,which may cause unnecessarily high strand bias in the predicted profile.Similarly, by default Stuttermodel will no longer output a fit on onestrand if no fit could be optained on the other strand.Changes have been made to rounding and column order in Samplestats.Various minor fixes and enhancements have been made, mostly to thevisualisations.### Version 0.0.3 (2016-02-02)First version of FDSTools with all strings attached. Introduces 15 new toolsand five visualisations.In Stuttermark, the column names 'name' and 'allele' have been changed to'marker' and 'sequence', respectively, reflecting those of all the othertools. WARNING: Stuttermark is now INCOMPATIBLE with output from TSSV, butmade compatible with TSSV-Lite and the new, bundled TSSV tool instead.### Version 0.0.2 (2015-07-23)Added a new global option: -d/--debug. This option disables the suppressionof technical details that would normally be visible when an error occurs.Stuttermark now accepts raw sequences and allele names as input, which areautomatically rewritten as TSSV-style sequences using a specified libraryfile. Also, the 'name' column is now optional.### Version 0.0.1 (2015-07-02)Initial version of FDSTools, featuring a single tool: Stuttermark v1.3.</longdescription>
