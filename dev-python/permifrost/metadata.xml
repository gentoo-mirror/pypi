	<longdescription># `permifrost`We welcome contributions, so please feel free to submit MRs or [issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/permifrost/-/issues/new) if you'd like to help in any way. To get started with contributions read the [Contributing](#contributing) section at the bottom of this README to get started.## InstallationInstall the most stable version using the following command:```pip install permifrost```If you would like to work with the most up-to-date functionality in permifrost install directly from GitLab using the following command:```pip install git+https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/permifrost.git```## UsageUse this command to check and manage the permissions of a Snowflake account.```bashpermifrost [-v] run &lt;spec_file&gt; [--role] [--dry] [--diff] [--user] [--ignore-memberships]``````shell#&gt; permifrost run --helpUsage: permifrost run [OPTIONS] SPEC  Grant the permissions provided in the provided specification file for  specific users and rolesOptions:  --dry        Do not actually run, just check.  --diff       Show full diff, both new and existing permissions.  --role TEXT  Run grants for specific roles. Usage: --role testrole --role               testrole2.  --user TEXT  Run grants for specific users. Usage: --user testuser --user               testuser2.  --ignore-memberships  Do not handle role membership grants/revokes  --help       Show this message and exit.```Use this utility command to run the SnowFlake specification loader to confirm that your `roles.yml` file is valid.```bashpermifrost [-v] spec-test &lt;spec_file&gt; [--role] [--user] [--ignore-memberships]``````shell#&gt;  permifrost spec-test --helpUsage: permifrost spec-test [OPTIONS] SPEC  Load SnowFlake spec based on the roles.yml provided.

If there aredifferences, it will return the sql grant and revoke commands required to makeit match the spec. If there are additional permissions set in the database thiscommand will create the necessary revoke commands with the exception of:- Object Ownership- Warehouse PrivilegesFurthermore, if you are using the recommended role of `SECURITYADMIN`, `ALTER USER ...` commands will fail on users that are owned by `ACCOUNTADMIN`. In these circumstances, it is highly recommended to log into the Snowflake instance and update ownership of all users to belong to `USERADMIN` as per Snowflake recommended best practices.Lastly, note that the default roles cannot have their role hierarchies modified. As such, any `GRANT ROLE &lt;default role&gt; TO ROLE &lt;default role&gt;;` will be excluded from the permission set generated by Permifrost.For example:```yaml...roles:  public:    member_of:      - useradmin  securityadmin:    member_of:      - useradmin...```Both of the above relationships will be skipped as this attempts to modify a default Snowflake permission structure which would generate an error on attempting to implement.Permifrost is heavily inspired by[pgbedrock](https://github.com/Squarespace/pgbedrock) which can be used formanaging the permissions in a Postgres database.## spec_fileThe YAML specification file is used to define in a declarative way thedatabases, roles, users and warehouses in a Snowflake account, together with thepermissions for databases, schemas and tables for the same account.All permissions are abbreviated as `read` or `write` permissions, withPermifrost generating the proper grants for each type of object. This includesshared databases which have simpler and more limited permissions than non-shareddatabases.According to the `read` vs. `write` permissions approach, you should be able togrant granular access like `read` permissions for usage of database and schemaand `write` permissions to insert data into a specific table within thatdatabase and schema.Tables and views are listed under `tables` and handled properly behind thescenes.If `*` is provided as the parameter for tables the grant statement will use the`ALL &lt;object_type&gt;s in SCHEMA` syntax. It will also grant to future tables andviews. See Snowflake documenation for [`ONFUTURE`](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/sql/grant-privilege.html#optional-parameters)If a schema name includes an asterisk, such as `snowplow_*`, then all schemasthat match this pattern will be included in the grant statement _unless it isfor ownership_, in which case the asterisk is not supported. This can be coupledwith the asterisk for table grants to grant permissions on all tables in allschemas that match the given pattern. This is useful for date-partitionedschemas.All entities must be explicitly referenced. For example, if a permission isgranted to a schema or table then the database must be explicitly referenced forpermissioning as well. Additionally, role membership must be explicit in theconfig file. If a role does not have a `member_of` list, it will have all rolesit currently has revoked.Roles can accept &quot;_&quot; as a role name either alone or nested under the `include`key. There is optionally an `exclude` key that can be used if `include` is used.`&quot;_&quot;`will grant membership to all roles defined in the spec. Any roles definedin`exclude`will be removed from the list defined in`include`.A specification file has the following structure:```bash# Databasesdatabases:    - db_name:        shared: boolean    - db_name:        shared: boolean        owner: role_name    ... ... ...# Rolesroles:    - role_name:        warehouses:            - warehouse_name            - warehouse_name            ...        member_of:            - role_name            - role_name            ...            # or        member_of:            include:                - &quot;*&quot;            exclude:                - role_name        privileges:            databases:                read:                    - database_name                    - database_name                    ...                write:                    - database_name                    - database_name                    ...            schemas:                read:                    - database_name.*                    - database_name.schema_name                    - database_name.schema_partial_*                    ...                write:                    - database_name.*                    - database_name.schema_name                    - database_name.schema_partial_*                    ...            tables:                read:                    - database_name.*.*                    - database_name.schema_name.*                    - database_name.schema_partial_*.*                    - database_name.schema_name.table_name                    ...                write:                    - database_name.*.*                    - database_name.schema_name.*                    - database_name.schema_partial_*.*                    - database_name.schema_name.table_name                    ...        owns:            databases:                - database_name                ...            schemas:                - database_name.*                - database_name.schema_name                ...            tables:                - database_name.*.*                - database_name.schema_name.*                - database_name.schema_name.table_name                ...    - role_name:        owner: role_name    ... ... ...# Usersusers:    - user_name:        can_login: boolean        member_of:            - role_name            ...    - user_name:        owner: role_name    ... ... ...# Warehouseswarehouses:    - warehouse_name:        size: x-small    - warehouse_name:        size: x-small        owner: role_name    ... ... ...```For a working example, you can check [the Snowflake specificationfile](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/permifrost/blob/master/tests/permifrost/specs/snowflake_spec.yml)that we are using for testing `permifrost permissions`.### SettingsAll settings are declared here with their default values and are describedbelow. These can be added to your spec.yaml file.```yamlrequire-owner: false````require-owner`: Set to true to force having to set the `owner` property on allobjects defined.## --diffWhen this flag is set, a full diff with both new and already granted commands isreturned. Otherwise, only required commands for matching the definitions on thespec are returned.## --dryWhen this flag is set, the permission queries generated are not actually sent tothe server and run; They are just returned to the user for examining them andrunning them manually.When this flag is not set, the commands will be executed on Snowflake and theirstatus will be returned and shown on the command line.## Connection ParametersThe following environmental variables must be available to connect to Snowflake:```bash$PERMISSION_BOT_USER$PERMISSION_BOT_ACCOUNT$PERMISSION_BOT_WAREHOUSE```### Username and PasswordTo connect using a username and password, also include the following:```bash$PERMISSION_BOT_PASSWORD$PERMISSION_BOT_DATABASE$PERMISSION_BOT_ROLE```Currently, Permifrost assumes you are using the SECURITYADMIN role and will failvalidation if you are not.### OAuthTo connect using an OAuth token, also include the following:```bash$PERMISSION_BOT_OAUTH_TOKEN```### External Browser SSO AuthTo connect using an external browser with SSO Auth, also include the following:```bash$PERMISSION_BOT_AUTHENTICATOR='externalbrowser'```### Key Pair AuthenticationRather than supplying a password or an oauth token, it's possible to connect viaSnowflake's Key Pair authentication by setting the following:```bash$PERMISSION_BOT_KEY_PATH$PERMISSION_BOT_KEY_PASSPHRASE```See [Snowflake-sqlalchemy](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-sqlalchemy#key-pair-authentication-support) for more info.## ContributingContributing to Permifrost is easy, and most commands to do so are availablewithin the Makefile.The easiest way to start developing is to run `make initial-setup` to installall the necessary packages to develop on the project. Next run `makepermifrost` in a second terminal, this will open a shell in a docker containerwith the local version of Permifrost installed.You can now make changes to the files in your editor and it will be reflected inthe commands that you run from the docker shell.To check code quality prior to committing changes, you can use `make local-lint`.See the [Makefile](Makefile) for more details.**WARNINGS**DO NOT name git branches with forward slashes `/` as the current CI pipeline isunable to manage names like this. (i.e. `username/feature/feature-name` willbreak the CI pipeline so `username.feature.feature-name` should be usedinstead)This project has [pre-commithooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks) installed to maintainthe existing code quality. As such, we strongly recommend you use a terminal to**commit** and **push** code changes. Specifically, avoid using gitintegrations on IDEs to make **commits** or **pushes**. **Adding** filesthrough the IDE git integrations are okay, but do not **commit** through theIDE. Use the terminal to commit changes because it will show the output of eachof the pre-commit checks to allow you to make changes as needed.For committing work-in-progress changes use `git commit --no-verify -m &quot;WIP:&lt;message&gt;&quot;`.For committing finalized changes, the below workflow will identify errors and allow for easier development:* Make your changes and `git add &lt;file name(s)&gt;`* `git commit` to identify/format errors in the changed files    * Repeat the following steps until all checks pass    * `git add &lt;file name(s)&gt;`    * `git commit`* Add message at the prompt and save/exit the commit file* When you are ready to push changes to the remote host, run `git push origin &lt;branch name&gt;`. This will perform additional linting/formatting checks.    * Repeat the following steps until all checks pass    * `git push origin &lt;branch name&gt;`    * `git add &lt;file name(s)&gt;`    * `git commit`* Add message at the prompt and save/exit the commit file* `git push origin &lt;branch name&gt;` until all checks pass## ReleasingSee the [issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/permifrost/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Releasing%20update.md)for guidance on how to release a new version of this project to PyPi</longdescription>
