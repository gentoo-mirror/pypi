Asphalt components publishtheir services as *resources* in a shared *context*. Components can build on resources provided byeach other, making it possible to create components that offer highly sophisticated functionalitywith relatively little effort.Full documentation: https://asphalt.readthedocs.io/.. _asyncio: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html.. _uvloop: https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop.. _tokio: https://github.com/PyO3/tokio.. _Type hints: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/.. _semantic versioning: http://semver.org/</longdescription>
