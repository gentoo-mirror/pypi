It is in earlydevelopment so use with caution.The official repository is [https://gitlab.com/thegalagic/figular](https://gitlab.com/thegalagic/figular).## Table of Contents&lt;!--* [Security](#security)--&gt;* [Install](#install)* [Background](#background)* [Usage](#usage)* [Thanks](#thanks)* [Contributing](#contributing)* [Licensing](#licensing)## InstallThe following instructions install Figular as a command line tool. If youwould like to deploy it as a website (like [Figular.com](https://figular.com/))see our [self-hosting](/docs/SelfHosting.md) doc instead.Prerequisites:* Linux* Python 3* [Asymptote](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/). This may be in your  distribution's repositories already as `asymptote`. If not see Asymptote's  [Installation](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/doc/Installation.html) docs.* [XeTeX](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/). This may be in your distribution's  [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) package already so try installing  `texlive`. If not then it's often installed explicitly as `texlive-xetex`.* [dvisvgm](https://dvisvgm.de/). A dependency of asymptote required for  producing SVG graphics. This may be in your distribution's repositories under  `dvisvgm`, `texlive-dvisvgm` or `texlive-extra-utils`. If not see dvisvgm's  [Downloads](https://dvisvgm.de/Downloads/) page.Install the latest version via pip:```bashpip install figular```This will install the cmdline tool `fig`. For usage see below.## BackgroundProducing visualisations and documents can result in a lot of effort that ishard to reuse. Work such as drawing a diagram by hand, arranging items, placingtext, aligning graphs and choosing colours may have to be repeated if a documentneeds to be updated or expanded to depict new data.If we can automate that work and have our visualisations react to new dataintelligently we can get a much higher level of reuse. If we can build acommunity we can share our efforts with others and build on theirwork in turn.Figular is designed to help in particular situations where:* You need to produce a good looking visualisation, image, document* You need to produce it more than once, for example a report or dashboard, a  set of labels, marketing campaign graphics.* The visualisation may need to adapt in future to changes in the data driving  it, design changes, layout tweaks etc.* You want to share/collaborate on the visualisation or leverage the work of  others.Figular provides preprepared visualisations that you can populate with your owndata and tweak the style or layout. You can also develop your own and share withthe community. Visualisations can be combined, remixed and adapted.It's available in the browser and at the cmdline.## UsageFigular produces SVG files. Run it from the cmdline:```bashfig [flags] FIGURE DATA [style]```You can specify FIGUREs by name, for example `concept/circle`. Follow this withDATA for the figure.For example to use the `concept/circle` figure and have it draw two circlescontaining 'One' and 'Two' use this:```bashfig concept/circle $'One\nTwo'```This will produce a file `out.svg`. Use the flag `--help` to see more usageexamples.Full documentation, a list of all figures and their styling is available in thedocs directory of the source repository or your installation i.e.[/docs/Figular.md](./docs/Figular.md).## ThanksLike all free/open source software Figular is made possible by building on theshoulders of giants. Our thanks to every contributor and maintainer who havebrought the ecosystem to where it is today.In particular we thank the [Asymptote](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/)project whose graphics language makes it easy to design pictures with code.## ContributingIt's great that you're interested in contributing.
