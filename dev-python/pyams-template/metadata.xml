	<longdescription>======================PyAMS_template package======================.. contents::What is PyAMS?==============PyAMS (Pyramid Application Management Suite) is a small suite of packages written for applicationsand content management with the Pyramid framework.**PyAMS** is actually mainly used to manage web sites through content management applications (CMS,see PyAMS_content package), but many features are generic and can be used inside any kind of webapplication.All PyAMS documentation is available on `ReadTheDocs &lt;https://pyams.readthedocs.io&gt;`_; source codeis available on `Gitlab &lt;https://gitlab.com/pyams&gt;`_ and pushed to `Github&lt;https://github.com/py-ams&gt;`_.What is PyAMS_template?=======================PyAMS is using Chameleon internally as HTML templates engine.This package, which is essentially an adaptation of &quot;z3c.template&quot; package for Pyramid, allows toseparate the definition of a view code from it's rendering template; this template selection canactually be based on the view but also on the request layer (see &quot;PyAMS_layer&quot; package to get moreinformation about layers).PyAMS_template package provides a &quot;template_config&quot; decorator, which allows you to define a templatefor a given view, and a &quot;layout_config&quot; decorator, which allows to define a &quot;layout&quot; template;layout templates are particularly useful when using &quot;pagelets&quot;, which are defined into anotherpackage (see PyAMS_pagelet).You can also override a template definition for a given view, without creating a new view class,just by using the &quot;override_template&quot; or &quot;override_layout&quot; functions.View and layout templates can also be declared using ZCML instead of Python code, by using the&lt;template /&gt; and &lt;layout /&gt; directives.Changelog=========2.0.1----- - updated Buildout configuration2.0.0----- - migrated to Pyramid 2.0 - added support for Python 3.10 and 3.111.2.0----- - removed support for Python &lt; 3.71.1.3----- - removed Travis-CI configuration1.1.2----- - updated Travis configuration1.1.1----- - updated global registry access1.1.0----- - removed ZCML directives - updated doctests1.0.6----- - updated super-call of layout and template getters1.0.5----- - refactored code to reduce duplicated lines1.0.4----- - modified required arguments of templates registration - updated doctests1.0.3----- - corrected duplicated variable name mismatch in &quot;template_config&quot; and &quot;layout_config&quot;   decorators1.0.2----- - new version to avoid upload issue!1.0.1----- - added Pyramid configuration settings to templates configuration1.0.0----- - initial release</longdescription>
