You can learn more by checking our [community resources](https://sansyrox.github.io/robyn/#/community-resources)!## üì¶ InstallationYou can simply use Pip for installation.```pip install robyn```Or, with [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/)```conda install -c conda-forge robyn```## ü§î Usage### üöÄ Define your APITo define your API, you can add the following code in an `app.py` file.```pythonfrom robyn import Robynapp = Robyn(__file__)@app.get(&quot;/&quot;)async def h(request):    return &quot;Hello, world!&quot;app.start(port=8080)```### üèÉ Run your codeSimply run the app.py file you created. You will then have access to a server on the `localhost:8080`, that you can request from an other program. Robyn provides several options to customize your web server.```$ python3 app.py```To see the usage```usage: app.py [-h] [--processes PROCESSES] [--workers WORKERS] [--dev] [--log-level LOG_LEVEL]Robyn, a fast async web framework with a rust runtime.options:  -h, --help                show this help message and exit  --processes PROCESSES     Choose the number of processes. [Default: 1]  --workers WORKERS         Choose the number of workers. [Default: 1]  --dev                     Development mode. It restarts the server based on file changes.  --log-level LOG_LEVEL     Set the log level name```Log level can be `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, or `ERROR`.### üíª Add more routesYou can add more routes to your API. Check out the routes in [this file](https://github.com/sansyrox/robyn/blob/main/integration_tests/base_routes.py) as examples.## üêç Python Version SupportRobyn is compatible with the following Python versions:&gt; Python &gt;= 3.7It is recommended to use the latest version of Python for the best performances.Please make sure you have the correct version of Python installed before starting to usethis project. You can check your Python version by running the following command in yourterminal:```bashpython --version```## üí° Features- Under active development!- Written in Rust, btw xD- A multithreaded Runtime- Extensible- A simple API- Sync and Async Function Support- Dynamic URL Routing- Multi Core Scaling- WebSockets!- Middlewares- Hot Reloading- Community First and truly FOSS!## üóíÔ∏è How to contribute### üèÅ Get startedPlease read the [code of conduct](https://github.com/sansyrox/robyn/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and go through [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/sansyrox/robyn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing to Robyn.Feel free to open an issue for any clarifications or suggestions.If you're feeling curious. You can take a look at a more detailed architecture [here](https://sansyrox.github.io/robyn/#/architecture).If you still need help to get started, feel free to reach out on our [community discord](https://discord.gg/rkERZ5eNU8).### ‚öôÔ∏è To Develop Locally1. Install the development dependencies (preferably inside a virtual environment): `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`2. Install the pre-commit git hooks: `pre-commit install`3. Run `maturin develop` or `maturin develop --cargo-extra-args=&quot;--features=io-uring&quot;` for using the experimental version of actix-web. This command will build the Robyn Rust package and install it in your virtual environment.4. Run `python3 integration_tests/base_routes.py`. This file contains several examples of routes we use for testing purposes. You can modify or add some to your likings.You can then request the server you ran from an other terminal. Here is a `GET` request done using [curl](https://curl.se/) for example:```bashcurl http://localhost:8080/sync/str```## ‚ú® Special thanks### ‚ú® Contributors/SupportersThanks to all the contributors of the project.
