	<longdescription>![friendly-traceback logo](images/friendly_logo.png)# friendly/friendly-traceback- **friendly_traceback**: Helps understand Python traceback- **friendly**: Prettier version of the above with some additional enhancements.This code repository is for **friendly**.Unless specified otherwise, from here on, **Friendly** will refer to both**friendly** and **friendly_traceback**## DescriptionCreated with Python beginners in mind, but also useful for experienced users,**Friendly** replaces standard tracebacksby something easier to understand, translatable into various languages. Currently, the information provided by **Friendly** is only availablein two languages: English and French.The additional information provided by **Friendly** includes`why()` a certain exception occurred,`what()` it means, exactly `where()` it occurred includingthe value of relevant variables, and[more](https://aroberge.github.io/friendly-traceback-docs/docs/html/).## InstallationMost users should install **friendly** instead of **friendly_traceback**,```python -m pip install friendly```This needs to be done from a terminal.In the command shown above,`python` refers to whatever you need to type to invoke yourfavourite Python interpreter.It could be `python`, `python3`, `py -3.8`, etc.For some special cases, includingusing a specialized editor like [Mu](https://codewith.mu) that has its own wayof installing Python packages, please consult the documentation.## Documentation[The documentation is available by clicking here.](https://friendly-traceback.github.io/docs/index.html)## ExampleThe following example illustrates the information that canbe provided by **Friendly**.First, we show the output of **friendly-traceback**```    Traceback (most recent call last):      File &quot;&lt;friendly-console:5&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;        test()      File &quot;&lt;friendly-console:4&gt;&quot;, line 2, in test        a = cost(pi)    NameError: name 'cost' is not defined        Did you mean `cos`?    A `NameError` exception indicates that a variable or    function name is not known to Python.    Most often, this is because there is a spelling mistake.    However, sometimes it is because the name is used    before being defined or given a value.    In your program, `cost` is an unknown name.    Instead of writing `cost`, perhaps you meant one of the following:    *   Global scope: `cos`, `cosh`, `acos`    Execution stopped on line 1 of file `'&lt;friendly-console:5&gt;'`.    --&gt;1: test()            test: &lt;function test&gt;    Exception raised on line 2 of file `'&lt;friendly-console:4&gt;'`.       1: def test():    --&gt;2:    a = cost(pi)                 ^^^^            global pi: 3.141592653589793```Next, the same output shown as a screen capture when using **friendly**.![Screen capture of the above example](images/explain.png)## Projects using Friendlyfriendly/friendly-traceback is used by:* [HackInScience](https://hackinscience.org)* [futurecoder](https://futurecoder.io)* [CodeGrade](https://www.codegrade.com/blog/friendly-better-error-messages-for-python)* [ddebug](https://github.com/matan-h/ddebug)Feel free to contact me to add your project to this list.## ContributeContribute by making suggestions for improvements, pointing out mistakes either inthe documentation or in the information provided by **Friendly**, or finding bugs.If you speak a language other than English or French and feel ambitious, you mightwant to work on translations into your own language.For more details, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)## License: MITFor more details, see [LICENSE](LICENSE).Some ideas were adopted from[DidYouMean-Python (aka BetterErrorMessages)](https://github.com/SylvainDe/DidYouMean-Python)by Sylvain Desodt, a project that is also using the MIT license; as of October 2021, that particular project is no longer maintained.## Code of ConductIn short: be respectful of everyone.For more details, see [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)## JetBrains supportWe graciously acknowledge the support of [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/?from=friendly-traceback)which enables us to use the professional versionof PyCharm for developing **Friendly**.[![JetBrains](images/jb_beam.png)](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/?from=friendly-traceback)</longdescription>
