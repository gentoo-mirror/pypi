It is available as an R (ARCOS) and python (arcos4py) package.ARCOS can identify and visualize collective protein activation in 2- and 3D cell cultures over time.This plugin integrates ARCOS into napari. Users can import tracked time-series data in CSV format. The pluginprovides GUI elements to process this data with ARCOS. Layers containing the detected collective events are subsequently added to the viewer.Following analysis, the user can export the output as a CSV file with the detected collective events or as a sequence of images to generate a movie.![](https://github.com/bgraedel/arcos-gui/assets/100028238/66fa2afa-6f24-4cce-b29e-4279066c6c25)[Watch full demo on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG_z_BFcAiQ)# InstallationYou can install `arcos-gui` via [pip]:    pip install arcos-gui## ContributingContributions are very welcome.

From wound healing to epithelial homeostasis to morphogenesis, coordinated activation of biomolecules between cells allows the collectives to perform more complex tasks and to better tackle environmental challenges. To capture this information exchange and to advance new theories of emergent phenomena, we created ARCOS, a computational method to detect and quantify collective signaling. We demonstrate ARCOS on cell and organism collectives with space–time correlations on different scales in 2D and 3D. We made a new observation that oncogenic mutations in the MAPK/ERK and PIK3CA/Akt pathways of MCF10A epithelial cells hyperstimulate intercellular ERK activity waves that are largely dependent on matrix metalloproteinase intercellular signaling. ARCOS is open-source and available as R and Python packages. It also includes a plugin for the napari image viewer to interactively quantify collective phenomena without prior programming experience.}&quot;,        issn = {0021-9525},        doi = {10.1083/jcb.202207048},        url = {https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202207048},        eprint = {https://rupress.org/jcb/article-pdf/222/10/e202207048/1915749/jcb/_202207048.pdf},    }</longdescription>
