JAXNS requires &gt;= Python 3.8.2. It is always highly recommended to use a unique virtual environment for each project.   To use `miniconda`, have it installed, and run```bash# To create a new env, if necessaryconda create -n jaxns_py python=3.11conda activate jaxns_py```## For end usersInstall directly from PyPi,```bashpip install jaxns```## For developmentClone repo `git clone https://www.github.com/JoshuaAlbert/jaxns.git`, and install:```bashcd jaxnspip install -r requirements.txtpip install -r requirements-tests.txtpip install -r requirements-examples.txtpip install .```# Getting help and contributing examplesDo you have a neat Bayesian problem, and want to solve it with JAXNS?I'm really encourage anyone in either the scientific community or industry to get involved and join the discussionforum.Please use the [github discussion forum](https://github.com/Joshuaalbert/jaxns/discussions) for getting help, orcontributing examples/neat use cases.# Quick startCheckout the examples [here](https://jaxns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#).## CaveatsThe caveat is that you need to be able to define your likelihood function with JAX. This is usually no big deal becauseJAX is just a replacement for NumPy and many likelihoods can be expressed such.If you're unfamiliar, take a quick tour of JAX (https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html).# Speed test comparison with other nested sampling packagesJAXNS is really fast because it uses JAX.JAXNS is much faster than PolyChord, MultiNEST, and dynesty, typically achieving two to three orders of magnitudeimprovement in speed on cheap likelihood evaluations.This is shown in (https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15286). With regards to how efficiently JAXNS used likelihood evaluations,JAXNS prizes exactness over efficiency, however since it employs an adaptive strategy, users can control efficiency bycontrolling some precision parameters.# Change Log5 Oct, 2023 -- JAXNS 2.2.6 released.
