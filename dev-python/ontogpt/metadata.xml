	<longdescription># OntoGPT[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/13996/monarch-initiative/ontogpt.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/13996/monarch-initiative/ontogpt)![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ontogpt)## Introduction_OntoGPT_ is a Python package for extracting structured information from text with large language models (LLMs), _instruction prompts_, and ontology-based grounding.Two different strategies for knowledge extraction are currently implemented in OntoGPT:[For more details, please see the full documentation.](https://monarch-initiative.github.io/ontogpt/)## Quick StartOntoGPT runs on the command line, though there's also a minimal web app interface (see `Web Application` section below).1. Ensure you have Python 3.9 or greater installed.2. Install with `pip`:    ```bash    pip install ontogpt    ```3. Set your OpenAI API key:    ```bash    runoak set-apikey -e openai &lt;your openai api key&gt;    ```4. See the list of all OntoGPT commands:    ```bash    ontogpt --help    ```5. Try a simple example of information extraction:    ```bash    echo &quot;One treatment for high blood pressure is carvedilol.&quot; &gt; example.txt    ontogpt extract -i example.txt -t drug    ```    OntoGPT will retrieve the necessary ontologies and output results to the command line. Your output will provide all extracted objects under the heading `extracted_object`.## Web ApplicationThere is a bare bones web application for running OntoGPT and viewing results.First, install the required dependencies with `pip` by running the following command:```bashpip install ontogpt[web]```Then run this command to start the web application:```bashweb-ontogpt```NOTE: We do not recommend hosting this webapp publicly without authentication.## EvaluationsOpenAI's functions have been evaluated on test data. Please see the full documentation for details on these evaluations and how to reproduce them.## CitationThe information extraction approach used in OntoGPT, SPIRES, is described further in: Caufield JH, Hegde H, Emonet V, Harris NL, Joachimiak MP, Matentzoglu N, et al.
