	<longdescription>OpenJudge=========**Refactored!**OpenJudge has been refactored to be faster and easier to set up! Thisrepository was about quick contests for small groups of 20-30 people. Somewherealong the way, I faltered and it became bloated. It's back now in a form whichis fast and light.Screenshots----------![Normal Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theSage21/openJudge/master/screens/home.png)![Leader Board Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theSage21/openJudge/master/screens/lb.png)Usage-----First install MongoDB by following the instructions [in their docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)```bashsudo apt-get install python3-devpip install --user pipenvpipenv install openjudge --python 3.5pipenv shellmkdir questionscd questionsmkdir 1cd 1# Create these filestouch statement i0 o0 i1 o0# go back to where the questions directory residescd ../../```To run openjudge two commands need to be issued.  `openjudge` and `openjudge --judge` in two separate terminals. The first is the interface and the second is the &quot;judge&quot;.[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/1kaLBpe57efO7FGKEc7dHLxb0.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/1kaLBpe57efO7FGKEc7dHLxb0)In case you have a lot of people sending in code and you deem that the code check is too slow, you just have to start another judge process with `openjudge --judge`.</longdescription>
