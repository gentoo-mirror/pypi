	<longdescription>Provides a CAPTCHA for Python using the reCAPTCHA service. Does not require        any imaging libraries because the CAPTCHA is served directly from reCAPTCHA.        Also allows you to securely obfuscate emails with Mailhide. This functionality        requires pycrypto. This library requires two types of API keys. If you'd like        to use the CAPTCHA, you'll need a key from https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create.        For Mailhide, you'll need a key from http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/apikey.                The trunk can be checked out from        http://recaptcha.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/recaptcha-plugins/python,        and the associated Google Code project lives at        http://code.google.com/p/recaptcha. Note that this is a shared        project/repository for reCAPTCHA clients for several languages/environments.                There is also a Google Group at http://groups.google.com/group/recaptcha/.        Please use the associated mailing list for any questions or comments:        recaptcha@googlegroups.com. Like the Google Code project, the Google Group        mailing list is also shared among the several reCAPTCHA client implementations.                The reCAPTCHA module is licensed under an MIT/X11 license.</longdescription>
