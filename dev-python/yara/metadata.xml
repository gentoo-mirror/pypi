	<longdescription>Introduction to yara-ctypes-python**********************************What's in yara-ctypes:* A ctypes libyara wrapper module which exposes libyara's exports into the  Python runtime (see: `yara-project's libyara v1.7`_).* A thread safe Rules object with an interface that is compatible with the  interface exposed in the yara-project CPython extension module.* namespace management to allow easy loading of multiple YARA rules into a  single Rules matching object. * Various Scanner class types to enable thread or process pool execution  of matching requests over a Rules object.* A feature rich command line interface that gives the user many options to  control how they may wish to perform a scan.  Why:* ctypes releases the GIL on system function calls...  Run your PC to its  true potential.* It simplifies things a lot by keeping high order logic such as managing rules  paths, filtering paths, controlling pooled execution, etc. inside of a  language such as Python.* No more building the PyC extension...  * I found a few bugs and memory leaks and wanted to make my life simple.As a reference and guide to yara-ctypes see: `yara-ctypes documentation`_For additional tips / tricks with this wrapper feel free to post a question at the github `yara-ctypes/issues`_ page. Project hosting provided by `github.com`_.[mjdorma+yara-ctypes@gmail.com]Install and run===============Simply run the following::    &gt; python setup.py install    &gt; python setup.py test    &gt; yara-ctypes -hor `PyPi`_::     &gt; pip install yara    &gt; yara-ctypes -h.. note::    If the package does not contain a pre-compiled libyara library for your    platform you will need to build and install it. See `notes on building`_.Compatability=============*yara-ctypes* is implemented to be compatible with Python 2.6+ and Python 3.x.It has been tested against the following Python implementations:Ubuntu 12.04: + CPython 2.7 (32bit, 64bit) + CPython 3.2 (32bit, 64bit)Ubuntu 11.10 |build_status|: + CPython 2.6 (32bit) + CPython 2.7 (32bit) + CPython 3.2 (32bit) + CPython 3.3 (32bit) Windows 7: + CPython 2.6 (32bit, 64bit) + CPython 3.2 (32bit, 64bit)OS X Mountain Lion + CPython 2.7 (64bit)Continuous integration testing is provided by `Travis CI &lt;http://travis-ci.org/&gt;`_.Issues======Source code for *yara-ctypes* is hosted on `GitHub &lt;https://github.com/mjdorma/yara-ctypes&gt;`_.
