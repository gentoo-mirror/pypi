	<longdescription>The argparse module makes it easy to write user friendly command lineinterfaces.The program defines what arguments it requires, and argparse will figure outhow to parse those out of sys.argv. The argparse module also automaticallygenerates help and usage messages and issues errors when users give theprogram invalid arguments.As of Python &gt;= 2.7 and &gt;= 3.2, the argparse module is maintained within thePython standard library. For users who still need to support Python &lt; 2.7 or&lt; 3.2, it is also provided as a separate package, which tries to staycompatible with the module in the standard library, but also supports olderPython versions.Also, we can fix bugs here for users who are stuck on some non-current pythonversion, like e.g. 3.2.3 (which has bugs that were fixed in a later 3.2.xrelease).argparse is licensed under the Python license, for details see LICENSE.txt.Compatibility-------------argparse should work on Python &gt;= 2.3, it was tested on:* 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7* 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4Installation------------Try one of these:    python setup.py install    easy_install argparse    pip install argparse    putting argparse.py in some directory listed in sys.path should also workBugs----If you find a bug in argparse (pypi), please try to reproduce it with latestpython 2.7 and 3.4 (and use argparse from stdlib).If it happens there also, please file a bug in the python.org issue tracker.If it does not happen there, file a bug in the argparse package issue tracker.</longdescription>
