	<longdescription># Welcome to AetherThe Aether platform is a system of applications and utilities for developers to rapidly and easily build algorithmsthat use satellite and geospatial data. The Aether platform is accessible by REST API and python, but operatesentirely in the cloud using deferred graphs. This allows developers to build and execute applications with processingabstracted away and minimal data transfer. An important consequence of this design choice is that the same algorithmcode developers use during exploration can be repackaged and deployed as mobile or web applications. Theseapplications are entirely portable, and can be published to users or other developers through a simple URL key.In that regard, the Aether platform is an SDK for satellite analytics and framework for mobile end user applications.The platform currently supports search of three publicly available Resources: The LandSat Archive (LandSat 4through 8), Sentinel-2, and the USDA Cropland Data Layer, a 30m map of the US categorizing the agricultural land useannually.The platform is designed to rapidly add new data layers, making them available through the same interface. Resourcescan be hosted by Aether, or made accessible via owner API, and restricted to a subset of users. The usage of eachResource and its geographic usage is tracked as well.The Aether platform is designed to allow user-developers to compile and publish their applications as easily as theyprototype, often with the same code. This tutorial demonstrates a developer creating an application that generatesan NDVI map from LandSat imagery for an arbitrary polygon, which does not need to be specified until runtime bythe end user (or mobile device).</longdescription>
