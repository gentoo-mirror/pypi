	<longdescription>Ansible Runner HTTP Event Emitter=================================This project is a plugin for [Ansible Runner](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner) that allows emitting Ansible status and events to HTTP services in the form of `POST` events. This can allow `Runner` to notify other systems as Ansible jobs are run and to deliver key events to that system if it's interested.For more details and the latest documentation see: https://ansible-runner.readthedocs.io/en/latest</longdescription>
