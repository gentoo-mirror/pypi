Those sets may overlap, and differentversions of the same dotfiles can be deployed using different predefined *profiles*.Or you may have a main set of dotfiles for youreveryday host and a subset you only need to deploy to temporaryhosts (cloud VM etc.) that may be usinga slightly different version of some of the dotfiles.Features:* Sync once every dotfile in Git for different usages* Allow dotfile templating* Dynamically generated dotfile contents with pre-defined variables* Comparison between deployed and stored dotfiles* Handling multiple profiles with different sets of dotfiles* Easily import and update dotfiles* Handle files and directories* Support symlinking of dotfiles* Associate actions to the deployment of specific dotfiles* Associate transformations for storing encrypted/compressed dotfiles* Provide solutions for handling dotfiles containing sensitive informationCheck the [example](#getting-started), the [documentation](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io/) orhow [people are using dotdrop](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/misc/people-using-dotdrop/)for more.Quick start:```bash## using dotdrop as a submodulemkdir dotfiles &amp;&amp; cd dotfilesgit initgit submodule add https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop.gitpip3 install -r dotdrop/requirements.txt --user./dotdrop/bootstrap.sh./dotdrop.sh --help```A mirror of this repository is available on GitLab under &lt;https://gitlab.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop&gt;.## Why dotdrop?There exist many tools to manage dotfiles; however, notmany allow to deploy different versions of the same dotfileon different hosts. Moreover, dotdrop allows to specify theset of dotfiles that need to be deployed for a specific profile.See the [example](#getting-started) for a concrete example ofwhy [dotdrop](https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop) rocks.---**Table of Contents*** [Installation](#installation)* [Getting started](#getting-started)* [Documentation](#documentation)* [Thank you](#thank-you)# InstallationSee the [installation instructions](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/).Dotdrop is available on:* [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dotdrop/)* [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/dotdrop)* [AUR (stable)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dotdrop/)* [AUR (git version)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dotdrop-git/)* [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/dotdrop)* [Pacstall](https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall-programs/blob/master/packages/dotdrop/dotdrop.pacscript)# Getting started[Create a new repository](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/#repository-setup)to store your dotfiles with dotdrop. *Init* or *clone* that new repository and[install dotdrop](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/).Then import any dotfiles (files or directories) you want to manage with dotdrop.You can either use the default profile (which resolves to the *hostname* of the hostyou are running dotdrop on) or provide it explicitly using the switch `-p`/`--profile`.Import dotfiles on host *home*:```bash$ dotdrop import ~/.vimrc ~/.xinitrc ~/.config/polybar```Dotdrop does two things:* Copy the dotfiles to the *dotpath* directory  (defined in `config.yaml`, defaults to *dotfiles*)* Create the associated entries in the `config.yaml` file  (in the `dotfiles` and `profiles` entries)Your config file will look like something similar to this:```yamlconfig:  backup: true  banner: true  create: true  dotpath: dotfiles  ignoreempty: false  keepdot: false  longkey: false  showdiff: false  workdir: ~/.config/dotdropdotfiles:  d_polybar:    dst: ~/.config/polybar    src: config/polybar  f_vimrc:    dst: ~/.vimrc    src: vimrc  f_xinitrc:    dst: ~/.xinitrc    src: xinitrcprofiles:  home:    dotfiles:    - f_vimrc    - f_xinitrc    - d_polybar```For a description of the different fields and their use,see the [config doc](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config/config-config/).Commit and push your changes with git.Then go to another host where your dotfiles need to be managed as well,clone the previously set up repository,and compare the local dotfiles with the ones stored in dotdrop:```bash$ dotdrop compare --profile=home```Now you might want to adapt the `config.yaml` file to your liking onthat second host. Let's say, for example, that you only want `d_polybar` and`f_xinitrc` to be deployed on that second host. You would then change your configto something like this (assuming that the second host's hostname is *office*):```yaml…profiles:  home:    dotfiles:    - f_vimrc    - f_xinitrc    - d_polybar  office:    dotfiles:    - f_xinitrc    - d_polybar```Then adapt any dotfile using the [templating](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/template/templating/)feature (if needed). For example, you might want different fonts sizes in Polybar for each host.Edit `&lt;dotpath&gt;/config/polybar/config`:```bash…{%@@ if profile == &quot;home&quot; @@%}font0 = sans:size=10;0{%@@ elif profile == &quot;office&quot; @@%}font0 = sans:size=14;0{%@@ endif @@%}font1 = &quot;Material Design Icons:style=Regular:size=14;0&quot;font2 = &quot;unifont:size=6;0&quot;…```You also want to have the correct interface set on the wireless network inthe Polybar config.Add a [variable](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config/config-variables/)to the config file (In the below example, *home* gets the default `wlan0` value forthe variable `wifi` while *office* gets `wlp2s0`):```yaml…variables:  wifi: &quot;wlan0&quot;…profiles:  home:    dotfiles:    - f_vimrc    - f_xinitrc    - d_polybar  office:    dotfiles:    - f_xinitrc    - d_polybar    variables:      wifi: &quot;wlp2s0&quot;```Then you can adapt the Polybar config file so that thevariable `wifi` gets correctly replaced during installation:```bash[module/wireless-network]type = internal/networkinterface = {{@@ wifi @@}}```Also, the home computer is running [awesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/),and the office computer [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm).The `~/.xinitrc` file will therefore be different while still sharing some lines.Edit `&lt;dotpath&gt;/xinitrc`:```bash#!/bin/bash# load Xresourcesuserresources=$HOME/.Xresourcesif [ -f &quot;$userresources&quot; ]; then      xrdb -merge &quot;$userresources&quot; &amp;fi# launch the wm{%@@ if profile == &quot;home&quot; @@%}exec awesome{%@@ elif profile == &quot;office&quot; @@%}exec bspwm{%@@ endif @@%}```Finally you want everything installed with the *office* profileto be logged; you thus add an action to the config file:```yaml…actions:  loginstall: &quot;echo {{@@ _dotfile_abs_src @@}} installed to {{@@ _dotfile_abs_dst @@}} &gt;&gt; {0}&quot;…profiles:  home:    dotfiles:    - f_vimrc    - f_xinitrc    - d_polybar  office:    dotfiles:    - f_xinitrc    - d_polybar    variables:      wifi: &quot;wlp2s0&quot;    actions:      - loginstall &quot;/tmp/dotdrop-installation.log&quot;```When done, you can install your dotfiles using:```bash$ dotdrop install```If you are unsure, you can always run `dotdrop compare` to seehow your local dotfiles would be updated by dotdrop before running`install` or you could run install with `--dry`.That's it, a single repository with all your dotfiles for your different hosts.For more, see the [docs](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io):* [Create actions](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config/config-actions/)* [Use transformations](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config/config-transformations/)* [Use variables](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config/config-variables/)* [Symlink dotfiles](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/symlink-dotfiles/)* [and more](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/howto/)# DocumentationDotdrop's documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://dotdrop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).# Thank youIf you like dotdrop, [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/deadc0de6).# ContributionIf you are having trouble installing or using dotdrop,[open an issue](https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop/issues).If you want to contribute, feel free to do a PR (please follow PEP8).Have a look at the[contribution guidelines](https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).# LicenseThis project is licensed under the terms of the GPLv3 license.</longdescription>
