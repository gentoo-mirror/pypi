	<longdescription># PyWry Web ViewerEasily create HTML webviewers in python utilizing the [wry](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry) library. Unlike many HTML viewers that exist for Python - Pywry allows you to run javacsript. PyWry is also a ~2mb footprint for Mac and Windows - Linux will require a few more libraries which are listed below. Please note: this library is currently in early alpha and is NOT ready for production use.## Installation---------------------PyWry is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip:```bashpip install pywry```---------------------For development, you can install from source with the following steps:- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/pywry.git`- Install rust: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`- Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`- Acitvate the environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Unix) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)- Install dependencies: `pip install .[dev]`- Build the pip package: `maturin build`- Install the package: `pip install [file path from above] --force-reinstall`## Usage```python&gt;&gt;&gt; from pywry import PyWry&gt;&gt;&gt; handler = PyWry()&gt;&gt;&gt; handler.send_html(&quot;&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to plotting in PyWry&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;)&gt;&gt;&gt; handler.start()```### Arguments| Argument | Description | Default || --- | --- | --- || `html_str` | The HTML string to display in the webview | `None` || `html_path` | The path to the HTML file to display in the webview | `None` || `title` | The title of the webview | `PyWry` |## Platform-specific notesAll platforms use [TAO](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao) to build the window, and wry re-exports it as an application module. Here is the underlying web engine each platform uses, and some dependencies you might need to install.### LinuxTao uses [gtk-rs](https://gtk-rs.org/) and its related libraries for window creation and wry also needs [WebKitGTK](https://webkitgtk.org/) for WebView. So please make sure the following packages are installed:#### Arch Linux / Manjaro```bashsudo pacman -S webkit2gtk```#### Debian / Ubuntu```bashsudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev```#### Fedora / CentOS / AlmaLinux```bashsudo dnf install gtk3-devel webkit2gtk3-devel```### macOSWebKit is native to macOS, so no additional dependencies are needed.### WindowsWebView2 provided by Microsoft Edge Chromium is used. So wry supports Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11.## Troubleshooting### Linux#### `&quot;/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgio-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_module_open_full&quot;`This is a known issue with the `gio` library. You can fix it by installing the `libglib2.0-dev` package.</longdescription>
