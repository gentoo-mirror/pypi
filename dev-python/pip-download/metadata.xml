	<longdescription># pip-download: A wrapper useful in offline scenario[简体中文]( https://github.com/youngquan/pip-download/blob/master/README_zh_CN.md)pip-download is a tool which can be used to download python projects and their dependencies listed onpypi's `download files` page. If you run the `pip-download` command to download one project on a Linux platform, packages end with `.whl` and can be directly installed on a Windows and a macOS platform will also be downloaded. In that way, you can use these downloaded packages to serve for a minimal pypi sever(like [pypiserver](https://pypi.org/project/pypiserver/) ) on your company internal network.At first, it uses `pip download xxx` command to download packages of the project `xxx` to a temp dir. Then it unpacks these downloaded packages' name and version to download all packages of the project `xxx`. These downloaded packages include packages end with `.whl` built on the Linux, Windows, macOS platform and the source packages end with `.tar.gz` or `.zip` .## Installationpip-download is distributed on [PyPI]( https://pypi.org ) and is available on Linux/macOS and Windows and supportsPython 3.6+. You can simply install pip-download as below:```bash$ pip install pip-download```However, it's a better choice to use a virtual environment:```bash$ python -m venv venv# On Windows:$ .\venv\Scripts\activate# On Linux:$ source venv/bin/activate$ pip install pip-download```[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is also a good choice.## UsageAfter installation, you can use pip-download to download python projects and its dependencies.```bash$ pip-download flask$ pip-download -r requirements.txt$ pip-download hatch -d /tmp/$ pip-dwonload -py cp37 ujson$ pip-dwonload -py cp37 -p win_amd64 ujson```Also, you can put your common options in the config file, `python_versions` and `platform_tags` are supported now:```bash$ pip-download --show-config/some-path-to/settings.json$ vim /some-path-to/settings.json{    &quot;python-versions&quot;: [&quot;cp37&quot;],    &quot;platform-tags&quot;: [&quot;win_amd64&quot;]}$ vim /some-path-to/settings.json{    &quot;python-versions&quot;: [&quot;cp37&quot;, &quot;cp36&quot;],    &quot;platform-tags&quot;: [&quot;win_amd64&quot;, &quot;manylinux&quot;]}```For more usage, use `pip-download --help`.## Credits- All the people who work on [Click](https://github.com/pallets/click)- All the people involved in the project [hatch](&lt;https://github.com/ofek/hatch&gt;)</longdescription>
