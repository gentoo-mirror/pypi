That is, objects that are also referenced from somewhere else in the program.      This is true for calculating the object's deep size and for traversing its descendants.2. `objsize` has a simple and robust implementation with significantly fewer lines of code, compared to `pympler`.   The Pympler implementation uses recursion, and thus have to use a maximal depth argument to avoid reaching Python's   max depth.   `objsize`, however, uses BFS which is more efficient and simple to follow.   Moreover, the Pympler implementation carefully takes care of any object type.   `objsize` archives the same goal with a simple and generic implementation, which has fewer lines of code.# Install```bashpip install objsize==0.6.1```# Basic UsageCalculate the size of the object including all its members in bytes.```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; import objsize&gt;&gt;&gt; objsize.get_deep_size(dict(arg1='hello', arg2='world'))340```It is possible to calculate the deep size of multiple objects by passing multiple arguments:```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; objsize.get_deep_size(['hello', 'world'], dict(arg1='hello', arg2='world'), {'hello', 'world'})628```# Complex Data`objsize` can calculate the size of an object's entire subtree in bytes regardless of the type of objects in it, and itsdepth.Here is a complex data structure, for example, that include a self reference:```pythonmy_data = (list(range(3)), list(range(3, 6)))class MyClass:    def __init__(self, x, y):        self.x = x        self.y = y        self.d = {'x': x, 'y': y, 'self': self}    def __repr__(self):        return &quot;MyClass&quot;my_obj = MyClass(*my_data)```We can calculate `my_obj` deep size, including its stored data.```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; objsize.get_deep_size(my_obj)708```We might want to ignore non-exclusive objects such as the ones stored in `my_data`.```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; objsize.get_deep_size(my_obj, exclude=[my_data])384```Or simply let `objsize` detect that automatically:```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; objsize.get_exclusive_deep_size(my_obj)384```# Non Shared Functions or Classes`objsize` filters functions, lambdas, and classes by default since they are usually shared among many objects.For example:```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; method_dict = {&quot;identity&quot;: lambda x: x, &quot;double&quot;: lambda x: x*2}&gt;&gt;&gt; objsize.get_deep_size(method_dict)232```Some objects, however, as illustrated in the above example, have unique functions not shared by other objects.Due to this, it may be useful to count their sizes.You can achieve this by providing an alternative filter function.```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; objsize.get_deep_size(method_dict, filter_func=objsize.shared_object_filter)986```Notes:* The default filter function is `objsize.shared_object_or_function_filter`.* When using `objsize.shared_object_filter`, shared functions and lambdas are also counted, but builtin functions are  still excluded.# Special CasesSome objects handle their data in a way that prevents Python's GC from detecting it.The user can supply a special way to calculate the actual size of these objects.## Case 1: `torch`Using a simple calculation of the object size won't work for `torch.Tensor`.```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; import torch&gt;&gt;&gt; objsize.get_deep_size(torch.rand(200))72```So the user can define its own size calculation handler for such cases:```pythonimport objsizeimport sysimport torchdef get_size_of_torch(o):    # `objsize.safe_is_instance` catches `ReferenceError` caused by `weakref` objects    if objsize.safe_is_instance(o, torch.Tensor):        return sys.getsizeof(o.storage())    else:        return sys.getsizeof(o)```Then use it as follows:```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; import torch&gt;&gt;&gt; objsize.get_deep_size(...   torch.rand(200),...   get_size_func=get_size_of_torch... )848```However, this neglects the object's internal structure.The user can help `objsize` to find the object's hidden storage by supplying it with its own referent and filterfunctions:```pythonimport objsizeimport gcimport torchdef get_referents_torch(*objs):    # Yield all native referents    yield from gc.get_referents(*objs)    for o in objs:        # If the object is a torch tensor, then also yield its storage        if type(o) == torch.Tensor:            yield o.storage()def filter_func(o):    # Torch storage points to another meta storage that is    # already included in the outer storage calculation,     # so we need to filter it.    # Also, `torch.dtype` is a common object like Python's types.    return not objsize.safe_is_instance(o, (        *objsize.SharedObjectOrFunctionType, torch.storage._UntypedStorage, torch.dtype    ))```Then use these as follows:```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; import torch&gt;&gt;&gt; objsize.get_deep_size(...   torch.rand(200),...   get_referents_func=get_referents_torch, ...   filter_func=filter_func... )1024```## Case 2: `weakref`Using a simple calculation of the object size won't work for `weakref.proxy`.```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; import weakref&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo(list):...     pass... &gt;&gt;&gt; o = Foo([0]*100)&gt;&gt;&gt; objsize.get_deep_size(o)896&gt;&gt;&gt; o_ref = weakref.proxy(o)&gt;&gt;&gt; objsize.get_deep_size(o_ref)72```To mitigate this, you can provide a method that attempts to fetch the proxy's referents:```pythonimport weakrefimport gcdef get_weakref_referents(*objs):    yield from gc.get_referents(*objs)    for o in objs:        if type(o) in weakref.ProxyTypes:            try:                yield o.__repr__.__self__            except ReferenceError:                pass```Then use it as follows:```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; objsize.get_deep_size(o_ref, get_referents_func=get_weakref_referents)968```After the referenced object will be collected, then the size of the proxy object will be reduced.```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; del o&gt;&gt;&gt; gc.collect()&gt;&gt;&gt; # Wait for the object to be collected &gt;&gt;&gt; objsize.get_deep_size(o_ref, get_referents_func=get_weakref_referents)72```# TraversalA user can implement its own function over the entire subtree using the traversal method, which traverses all theobjects in the subtree.```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; for o in objsize.traverse_bfs(my_obj):...     print(o)... MyClass{'x': [0, 1, 2], 'y': [3, 4, 5], 'd': {'x': [0, 1, 2], 'y': [3, 4, 5], 'self': MyClass}}[0, 1, 2][3, 4, 5]{'x': [0, 1, 2], 'y': [3, 4, 5], 'self': MyClass}210543```Similar to before, non-exclusive objects can be ignored.```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; for o in objsize.traverse_exclusive_bfs(my_obj):...     print(o)... MyClass{'x': [0, 1, 2], 'y': [3, 4, 5], 'd': {'x': [0, 1, 2], 'y': [3, 4, 5], 'self': MyClass}}{'x': [0, 1, 2], 'y': [3, 4, 5], 'self': MyClass}```# License[BSD-3](LICENSE)</longdescription>
