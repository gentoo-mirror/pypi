	<longdescription>An assortment of utilities for the Trio async/await framework, including:  * wait_any, wait_all, move_on_when - avoid nursery blocks for simple cases  * AsyncBool, AsyncValue - value wrappers with the ability to wait for    a specific value or transition  * periodic - periodic loop which accounts for its own execution    time  * @trio_async_generator - decorator which adapts a generator containing     Trio constructs for safe use  * azip, azip_longest - async zip with parallel iteration  * RepeatedEvent - if you really, really want to reuse an event  * and more (... obscure stuff you probably don't need)!</longdescription>
