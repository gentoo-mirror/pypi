	<longdescription>ReproZip project================`ReproZip &lt;https://www.reprozip.org/&gt;`__ is a tool aimed at simplifying the process of creating reproducible experiments from command-line executions, a frequently-used common denominator in computational science. It tracks operating system calls and creates a bundle that contains all the binaries, files and dependencies required to run a given command on the author's computational environment (packing step).  A reviewer can then extract the experiment in his environment to reproduce the results (unpacking step).reprounzip-vagrant------------------This is the component responsible for the unpacking step on different environments (Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X) by using a `Vagrant &lt;https://www.vagrantup.com/&gt;`_ virtual machine.Please refer to `reprozip &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reprozip&gt;`__, `reprounzip &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reprounzip&gt;`_, and `reprounzip-docker &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reprounzip-docker&gt;`_ for other components and plugins.Additional Information----------------------For more detailed information, please refer to our `website &lt;https://www.reprozip.org/&gt;`_, as well as to our `documentation &lt;https://docs.reprozip.org/&gt;`_.ReproZip is currently being developed at `NYU &lt;http://engineering.nyu.edu/&gt;`_.
