For moreinformation read [history](https://wexpect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html#refactor).---## What is wexpect?Wexpect is a Python module for spawning child applications and controllingthem automatically. Wexpect can be used for automating interactive applicationssuch as ssh, ftp, passwd, telnet, etc. It can be used to a automate setupscripts for duplicating software package installations on different servers. Itcan be used for automated software testing. Wexpect is in the spirit of DonLibes' Expect, but Wexpect is pure Python. Other Expect-like modules for Pythonrequire TCL and Expect or require C extensions to be compiled. Wexpect does notuse C, Expect, or TCL extensions.Original Pexpect should work on any platform that supports the standard Python pty module. WhileWexpect works on Windows platforms. The Wexpect interface focuses on ease of use so that simpletasks are easy.---## DevThanks for any contributing!### TestTo run test, enter into the folder of the wexpect's repo then:`python -m unittest`### DeployThe deployment itself is automated and done by [appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/raczben/wexpect).See `after_test` section in [appveyor.yml](appveyor.yml) for more details.The wexpect uses [pbr](https://docs.openstack.org/pbr/latest/) for managing releasing procedures.The versioning is handled by the pbr. The *&quot;master-version&quot;* is the git tag. Pbr derives the packageversion from the git tags.</longdescription>
