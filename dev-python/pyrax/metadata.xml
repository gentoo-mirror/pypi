See `openstacksdk &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/openstacksdk&gt;`__   and the `rackspacesdk &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rackspacesdk&gt;`__   plugin in order to interact with Rackspace's OpenStack-based   public cloud.See the LICENSE file for license and copyright information.**pyrax** should work with most OpenStack-based cloud deployments,though it specifically targets the Rackspace public cloud. For example,the code for cloudfiles contains the ability to publish your content onRackspace's CDN network, even though CDN support is not part ofOpenStack Swift. But if you don't use any of the CDN-related code, yourapp will work fine on any standard Swift deployment.See the `ReleaseNotes &lt;https://github.com/pycontribs/pyrax/tree/master/RELEASENOTES.md&gt;`_for what has changed in the latest releaseGetting Started with OpenStack/Rackspace----------------------------------------To sign up for a Rackspace Cloud account, go to`http://cart.rackspace.com/cloud &lt;http://cart.rackspace.com/cloud&gt;`_and follow the prompts.If you are working with an OpenStack deployment, you can find moreinformation at `http://www.openstack.org &lt;http://www.openstack.org&gt;`_.Requirements-------------  A Rackspace Cloud account   -  username   -  API key-  Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7   -  Support for Python 3.4 ends in March 2019.   -  Support for Python 2.7 ends at the end of 2019.   -  pyrax is not yet tested yet with other Python versions.
