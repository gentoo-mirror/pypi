As an example: if an event is longer than one day it is still included if it takes place at ``a_date``... code:: Python    a_date =  2023   # a year    a_date = (2023,) # a year    a_date = (2023, 1) # January in 2023    a_date = (2023, 1, 1) # the 1st of January in 2023    a_date = &quot;20230101&quot;   # the 1st of January in 2023    a_date = (2023, 1, 1, 0) # the first hour of the year 2023    a_date = (2023, 1, 1, 0, 0) # the first minute in 2023    a_date = datetime.date(2023) # the first day in 2023    a_date = datetime.date(2023, 1, 1) # the first day in 2023    a_date = datetime.datetime.now() # this exact second    events = recurring_ical_events.of(an_icalendar_object).at(a_date)The resulting ``events`` are a list of `icalendar events &lt;https://icalendar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#icalendar.cal.Event&gt;`_, see below.``between(start, end)``***********************``between(start, end)`` returns all events happening between a start and an end time. Both arguments can be `datetime.datetime`_, `datetime.date`_, tuples of numbers passed as arguments to `datetime.datetime`_ or strings in the form of``%Y%m%d`` (``yyyymmdd``) and ``%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ`` (``yyyymmddThhmmssZ``).For examples, see ``at(a_date)`` above... code:: Python    events = recurring_ical_events.of(an_icalendar_object).between(start, end)The resulting ``events`` are in a list of `icalendar events`_, see below.``events`` as list******************The result of both ``between(start, end)`` and ``at(a_date)`` is a list of `icalendar events`_.By default, all attributes of the event with repetitions are copied, like ``UID`` and ``SUMMARY``.However, these attributes may differ from the source event:* ``DTSTART`` which is the start of the event instance. (always present)* ``DTEND`` which is the end of the event instance. (always present)* ``RDATE``, ``EXDATE``, ``RRULE`` are the rules to create event repetitions.  They are **not** included in repeated events, see `Issue 23 &lt;https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/23&gt;`_.  To change this, use ``of(calendar, keep_recurrence_attributes=True)``.Different Components, not just Events*************************************By default the ``recurring_ical_events`` only selects events as the name already implies.However, there are different `components &lt;https://icalendar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#icalendar.cal.Component&gt;`_ available in a `calendar &lt;https://icalendar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#icalendar.cal.Calendar&gt;`_.You can select which components you like to have returned by passing ``components`` to the ``of`` function:.. code:: Python    of(a_calendar, components=[&quot;VEVENT&quot;])Here is a template code for choosing the supported types of components:.. code:: Python   events = recurring_ical_events.of(calendar).between(...)   journals = recurring_ical_events.of(calendar, components=[&quot;VJOURNAL&quot;]).between(...)   todos = recurring_ical_events.of(calendar, components=[&quot;VTODO&quot;]).between(...)   all = recurring_ical_events.of(calendar, components=[&quot;VTODO&quot;, &quot;VEVENT&quot;, &quot;VJOURNAL&quot;]).between(...)If a type of component is not listed here, it can be added.Please create an issue for this in the source code repository.Speed*****If you use ``between()`` or ``at()``several times, it is faster to re-use the object coming from ``of()``... code:: Python    rcalendar = recurring_ical_events.of(an_icalendar_object)    events_of_day_1 = rcalendar.at(day_1)    events_of_day_2 = rcalendar.at(day_2)    events_of_day_3 = rcalendar.at(day_3)    # ...Version Fixing**************If you use this library in your code, you may want to make sure thatupdates can be received but they do not break your code.The version numbers are handeled this way: ``a.b.c`` example: ``0.1.12``- ``c`` is changed for each minor bug fix.- ``b`` is changed whenever new features are added.- ``a`` is changed when the interface or major assumptions change that may break your code.So, I recommend to version-fix this library to stay with the same ``a``while ``b`` and ``c`` can change.Development-----------To run the tests, we use ``tox``.``tox`` tests all different Python versions which we want to  be compatible to... code-block:: shell   pip3 install toxTo run all the tests:.. code-block:: shell   toxTo run the tests in a specific Python version:.. code-block:: shell   tox -e py39Testing*******This project's development is driven by tests.Tests assure a consistent interface and less knowledge lost over time.If you like to change the code, tests help that nothing breaks in the future.They are required in that sense.Example code and ics files can be transferred into tests and speed up fixing bugs.You can view the tests in the `test folder&lt;https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/tree/master/test&gt;`_.If you have a calendar ICS file for which this library does notgenerate the desired output, you can add it to the ``test/calendars``folder and write tests for what you expect.If you like, `open an issue &lt;https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues&gt;`_ first, e.g. to discuss the changes andhow to go about it.New Releases------------To release new versions,1. edit the Changelog Section2. edit setup.py, the ``__version__`` variable3. create a commit and push it4. wait for `GitHub Actions &lt;https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/actions&gt;`_ to finish the build5. run   .. code-block:: shell       python3 setup.py tag_and_deploy6. notify the issues about their releaseChangelog---------- v2.1.1  - Claim and test support for Python 3.11.  - Support deleting events by setting RRULE UNTIL &lt; DTSTART, see `Issue 117 &lt;https://github.com/niccokunzmann/python-recurring-ical-events/issues/117&gt;`__.- v2.1.0  - Added support for PERIOD values in RDATE.
