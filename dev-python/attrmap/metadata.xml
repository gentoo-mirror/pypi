	<longdescription># AttrMap`attrmap` is an open source tool with **read-only protection** to help users get rid of dictionary in Python.## Introduction`attrmap` maps the `dict` to an object of `AttrMap`, so users can avoid using the annoying `[&quot;&quot;]` syntax.Users are welcome to report issues or request new features.The API references can be found [here](https://attrmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).## What's New- 2022-12-20: Fix the annoying warning when creating an AttrMap instance.- 2022-08-27: Add utilities for AttrMap, see [docs](https://attrmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).- 2022-08-27: Add deprecated warnings.- 2022-08-13: Fix the `delattr` bug, users can delete an item via `del obj.attr` when the `AttrMap` object is modifiable.- 2022-08-13: Fix the improper use of type hint, now `attrmap` is available for python&gt;=3.6.- 2022-08-13: Update the document.## InstallationYou can install `attrmap` via pip:```bashpip install -U attrmap```## Getting StartedAssuming you have an instance of `dict`, then you can build an object of `AttrMap` as follows:```pythonfrom attrmap import AttrMapimport attrmap.utils as auCONFIGS = {    &quot;attr1&quot;: 1,     &quot;attr2&quot;: [&quot;hello&quot;, &quot; &quot;, &quot;world&quot;],     &quot;attr3&quot;: {        &quot;subattr1&quot;: &quot;subattr1&quot;,         &quot;subattr2&quot;: {            &quot;subsubattr1&quot;: &quot;subsubattr1&quot;,        }    }}configs = AttrMap(CONFIGS)# Set the object unmodifiable.configs = au.convert_state(configs, read_only=True)# Equivalent to:# au.convert_state(configs, read_only=True)print(configs) # The outputs is more human readable.# Object Contains Following Attributes#  attr1: 1#  attr2: ['hello', ' ', 'world']#  attr3:#          subattr1: subattr1#          subattr2:#                  subsubattr1: subsubattr1```You can also assign the attributes and their values in a more simple way:```python# Assume you have import AttrMap# Create an empty AttrMap object.configs = AttrMap()configs.attr1 = 1configs.attr2 = [&quot;hello&quot;, &quot; &quot;, &quot;world&quot;]configs.attr3.subattr1 = &quot;subattr1&quot;configs.attr3.subattr2.subsubattr1 = &quot;subsubattr1&quot;print(configs)# Object Contains Following Attributes#  attr1: 1#  attr2: ['hello', ' ', 'world']#  attr3:#          subattr1: subattr1#          subattr2:#                  subsubattr2: subsubattr1```You can convert the `AttrMap` object to Python `dict` anytime:```pythonconfigs_dict = au.todict(configs)print(configs_dict)# {'attr1': 1, 'attr2': ['hello', ' ', 'world'], 'attr3': {'subattr1': 'subattr1', 'subattr2': {'subsubattr1': 'subsubattr1'}}}print(type(configs_dict))# &lt;class 'dict'&gt;# AttrMap object doesn't store the original dict. print(id(configs_dict))# 139881853477376print(id(CONFIGS))# 139881853478464# But it do not change the items:print(configs_dict == CONFIGS)# True````attrmap` has the `read-only` protection to protect you from unintentional modification:```python# Assume you have the above AttrMap object named configs# Now set the AttrMap object as read-only.configs = au.convert_state(configs, read_only=True)# Try to create a new attribute.configs.attr4 = &quot;unintentional modification&quot;# Traceback (most recent call last):#   File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;#   File &quot;/xxxx/attrmap.py&quot;, line 558, in __setattr__#     self._check_modifiable()#   File &quot;/xxxx/attrmap.py&quot;, line 643, in _check_modifiable#     raise AttributeError(# AttributeError: Modifying the attributes of a read-only AttrMap instance is not allowed.# Try to modify the value of existing attribute:configs.attr1 = &quot;unintentional modification&quot;# Traceback (most recent call last):#   File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;#   File &quot;/xxxx/attrmap.py&quot;, line 558, in __setattr__#     self._check_modifiable()#   File &quot;/xxxx/attrmap.py&quot;, line 643, in _check_modifiable#     raise AttributeError(# AttributeError: Modifying the attributes of a read-only AttrMap instance is not allowed.```The `read-only` protection is quite useful when you use the `AttrMap` object to store the configuration of any system, any unintentional modification is not allowed. If you want to update the attribute's value, just set the `read_only` of the `AttrMap` instance as `False` via `au.convert_state(obj, read_only=False)`.If the `AttrMap` object should be unmodifiable, setting the object as **read-only** is recommended.You can also build an `AttrMap` instance from a `.json` or `.yaml` file. For example, assume you have a `file.json` file:```json{    &quot;language&quot;: [&quot;python&quot;, &quot;cpp&quot;, &quot;java&quot;],     &quot;value&quot;: [[&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;]],     &quot;structure&quot;:{        &quot;tree&quot;:[&quot;left tree&quot;, &quot;right tree&quot;]    }}```Then you can build `AttrMap` object via:```pythonfrom attrmap import AttrMapconfigs = AttrMap(path2file=&quot;/PATH_TO_YOUR_DIRECTORY/file.json&quot;) # .yaml file works too.print(configs)# Object Contains Following Attributes#  language: ['python', 'cpp', 'java']#  value: [['one', 'two']]#  structure:#          tree: ['left tree', 'right tree']```**NOTE:** The `read-only` protection should be explicitly enabled, `AttrMap` assumes you are still setting the attributes and their values.## Known Issues- Attributes start with `_` might be conflict with `AttrMap` perserved methods/properties. Attributes can still be accessed via dict-style (`[&quot;&quot;]`), but the attribute-stylewill return the &quot;protected&quot; (not the term of python, only means it's not &quot;public&quot;) method such as `_build_from_dict`.- Some public available properties and methods are reserved, they can only accessed via the dict-style.## Running TestsOpen bash shell and execute:```bashbash -i ./auto_test.sh```## APIsSee [The API Reference](https://attrmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules.html)## TODO## LICENSE`AttrMap` is an open source tool under Apache 2.0 license.Copyright 2022 Yiqun Chen.
