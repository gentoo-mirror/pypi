Fairlearn contains mitigation algorithmsas well as metrics for model assessment. Besides the source code, thisrepository also contains Jupyter notebooks with examples of Fairlearnusage.Website: https://fairlearn.org/-  `Current release &lt;#current-release&gt;`__-  `What we mean by *fairness* &lt;#what-we-mean-by-fairness&gt;`__-  `Overview of Fairlearn &lt;#overview-of-fairlearn&gt;`__-  `Fairlearn metrics &lt;#fairlearn-metrics&gt;`__-  `Fairlearn algorithms &lt;#fairlearn-algorithms&gt;`__-  `Install Fairlearn &lt;#install-fairlearn&gt;`__-  `Usage &lt;#usage&gt;`__-  `Contributing &lt;#contributing&gt;`__-  `Maintainers &lt;#maintainers&gt;`__-  `Issues &lt;#issues&gt;`__Current release----------------  The current stable release is available on   `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/fairlearn/&gt;`__.-  Our current version may differ substantially from earlier versions.   Users of earlier versions should visit our   `version guide &lt;https://fairlearn.org/main/user_guide/installation_and_version_guide/version_guide.html&gt;`_   to navigate significant changes and find information on how to migrate.What we mean by *fairness*--------------------------An AI system can behave unfairly for a variety of reasons. In Fairlearn,we define whether an AI system is behaving unfairly in terms of itsimpact on people â€“ i.e., in terms of harms. We focus on two kinds ofharms:-  *Allocation harms.* These harms can occur when AI systems extend or   withhold opportunities, resources, or information. Some of the key   applications are in hiring, school admissions, and lending.-  *Quality-of-service harms.* Quality of service refers to whether a   system works as well for one person as it does for another, even if   no opportunities, resources, or information are extended or withheld.We follow the approach known as **group fairness**, which asks: *Whichgroups of individuals are at risk for experiencing harms?* The relevantgroups need to be specified by the data scientist and are applicationspecific.Group fairness is formalized by a set of constraints, which require thatsome aspect (or aspects) of the AI system's behavior be comparableacross the groups. The Fairlearn package enables assessment andmitigation of unfairness under several common definitions. To learn moreabout our definitions of fairness, please visit our`user guide on Fairness of AI Systems &lt;https://fairlearn.org/main/user_guide/fairness_in_machine_learning.html#fairness-of-ai-systems&gt;`__.    *Note*: Fairness is fundamentally a sociotechnical challenge. Many    aspects of fairness, such as justice and due process, are not    captured by quantitative fairness metrics. Furthermore, there are    many quantitative fairness metrics which cannot all be satisfied    simultaneously. Our goal is to enable humans to assess different    mitigation strategies and then make trade-offs appropriate to their    scenario.Overview of Fairlearn---------------------The Fairlearn Python package has two components:-  *Metrics* for assessing which groups are negatively impacted by a   model, and for comparing multiple models in terms of various fairness   and accuracy metrics.-  *Algorithms* for mitigating unfairness in a variety of AI tasks and   along a variety of fairness definitions.Fairlearn metrics~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Check out our in-depth `guide on the Fairlearnmetrics &lt;https://fairlearn.org/main/user_guide/assessment&gt;`__.Fairlearn algorithms~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~For an overview of our algorithms please refer to our`website &lt;https://fairlearn.org/main/user_guide/mitigation/index.html&gt;`__.Install Fairlearn-----------------For instructions on how to install Fairlearn check out our `Quickstartguide &lt;https://fairlearn.org/main/quickstart.html&gt;`__.Usage-----For common usage refer to the `Jupyter notebooks &lt;https://fairlearn.org/main/auto_examples/index.html&gt;`__ andour `user guide &lt;https://fairlearn.org/main/user_guide/index.html&gt;`__.Please note that our APIs are subject to change, so notebooks downloadedfrom ``main`` may not be compatible with Fairlearn installed with``pip``. In this case, please navigate the tags in the repository (e.g.`v0.7.0 &lt;https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/tree/v0.7.0&gt;`__) tolocate the appropriate version of the notebook.Contributing------------To contribute please check our `contributorguide &lt;https://fairlearn.org/main/contributor_guide/index.html&gt;`__.Maintainers-----------A list of current maintainers is`on our website &lt;https://fairlearn.org/main/about/index.html&gt;`__.Issues------Usage Questions~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Pose questions and help answer them on `StackOverflow &lt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fairlearn&gt;`__ withthe tag ``fairlearn`` or on`Discord &lt;https://discord.gg/R22yCfgsRn&gt;`__.Regular (non-security) issues~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Issues are meant for bugs, feature requests, and documentationimprovements.
