The solutions contains utilities and functions that implmenting projects use to deploy specific azure solutions for customers.### InstallationIt it important to note that this package is installed and distributed in two different modes:- **Local Binary Installation** -&gt; This requires the needed packages to be install globally.  This is how development with dependent projects (i.e. empower) is typically done.- **Containerized** -&gt; The containerized method includes binary dependencies which are used for CI/CD and is how the artifact is actually deployed and used in production.#### Mac Prequisites- `brew install docker docker-compose`#### Windows Prequisites_TODO_#### Local Binary Build`poetry install``poetry build``pip3 uninstall whizbang-deployer -y``pip3 install ./dist/whizbang*.whl`_Then run any solution file directly: `python solution.py`_**To run tests:**`python3 -m pytest`#### Containerized Build_These may no longer work._**To run pytests:**- `docker-compose -f docker_builds/docker-compose.yml up --build pyenv`**To run pytests with watch:**- `docker-compose -f docker_builds/docker-compose.yml up --build pyenv-watch`</longdescription>
