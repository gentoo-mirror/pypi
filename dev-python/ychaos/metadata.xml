Most ofthese failures are unexpected and are not tested while development.The service which is capable of handling an unexpected failure passes thecriteria of a resilient service.YChaos provides a self-serving framework to inject these unexpected failuresinto your service in the form of YChaos Agents and understand if your serviceis equipped to handle unknown failures either within the serviceor from a 3rd party service dependency.## InstallTo install ychaos from PyPi,```bashpip install ychaos[&lt;subpackage&gt;]```The following subpackages are available for usage1. agents : `pip install ychaos[agents]`2. chaos : `pip install ychaos[chaos]`To know more about each subpackage and what they do, refer to the [documentation](https://yahoo.github.io/ychaos)You can also install the package from the source code.```bashgit clone https://github.com/yahoo/ychaoscd ychaospip install &quot;.[&lt;subpackage&gt;]&quot;```## UsageRefer to the [documentation](https://yahoo.github.io/ychaos) to know about the usage.## Maintainers[The Resilience Team @yahoo](mailto://ychaos-dev@yahooinc.com)## LicenseThis project is licensed under the terms of the Apache 2.0 open source license.
