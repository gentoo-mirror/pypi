	<longdescription># clikan: CLI (Personal) KanbanThere has been a little chatter about 'personal' kanban on the tubes lately.  I don't know about the need to hype it as personal, but if you're looking to get your head wrapped around stuff needing to get done - then kanban is a healthy tool.  clikan is a super simple command-line utility for tracking tasks following the Japanese Kanban (boarding) style.  clikan's core intent is to be easy to use, and to maintain simplicity.![icon](docs/icon-256x256.png)## Installation$ `pip install clikan`### Alternative Installation with Guix$ `guix install clikan`### Create a `.clikan.yaml` in your $HOME directory```yaml---clikan_data: /Users/kplummer/.clikan.datlimits:  todo: 10  wip: 3  done: 10  taskname: 40repaint: true```* `clikan_data` is the datastore file location.* `limits:todo` is the max number of items allowed in the todo column, keep this small - you want a smart list, not an ice box of ideas here.* `limits:wip` is the max number of items allowed in in-progress at a given time.  Context-switching is a farce, focus on one or two tasks at a time.* `limits:done` is the max number of done items visible, they'll still be stored.  It's good to see a list of done items, for pure psyche.* `limits:taskname` is the max length of a task text.* `repaint` is used to tell `clikan` to show the display after every successful command - default is false/off.-- or --$ `clikan configure`to create a default data file location.This is where the tool will store the history of files.  It's configurable so you can put the data in a Dropbox or other cloud-watched directory for safe archiving/backing up.If you're like me, even `clikan` is a bunch too many characters to type, so shorten with an alias in my shell config to `clik`.## UsageThe basic usage of clikan breaks down into three basic commands:### Show$ `clikan show` (alias: s)### Add$ `clikan add [task text]` (alias: a)### Promote$ `clikan promote [task id]` (alias: p)And there are more supporting commands:### Regress$ `clikan regress [task id]`### Delete$ `clikan delete [task id]` (alias: d)### Configure$ `clikan configure`### Screenshot![Screenshot](screenshot.png)## DevelopmentIt's Python code.  Fork, fix, and submit a PR - it'd be super appreciated.Tests?  Um, yeah.### TestingUpdated test suite to include 3.6-3.9 on Windows, macOS and Ubuntu.***Definitely*** need some help here.  There is a basic test suite available in `clikan_test.py`.To run it, make sure ~/.clikan.dat is empty, or specify a test localewith the `CLIKAN_HOME` environment variable the you can run:```CLIKAN_HOME=/tmp pytest clikan_test.py```The project uses this environment variable feature to test different functional configuration scenarios internally to the test suite.Am considering adding the `--config_file` feature to allow for specifying the path to the config file as well.  If this is something you're interesting in or believe would be beneficial let me know through an Github issue.## License```MIT LicenseCopyright 2018 Kit PlummerPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
