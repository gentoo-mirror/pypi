	<longdescription>XIST provides an extensible HTML and XML generator. XIST is also a XML parserwith a very simple and pythonesque tree API. Every XML element type correspondsto a Python class and these Python classes provide a conversion method totransform the XML tree (e.g. into HTML). XIST can be considered'object oriented XSLT'.XIST also includes the following modules and packages:* ``ll.ul4c`` is compiler for a cross-platform templating language with  similar capabilities to `Django's templating language`__. ``UL4`` templates  are compiled to an internal format, which makes it possible to implement  template renderers in other languages and makes the template code &quot;secure&quot;  (i.e. template code can't open or delete files).  __ https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/templates/  There are implementations for Python, Java and Javascript.* ``ll.ul4on`` provides functions for encoding and decoding a lightweight  machine-readable text-based format for serializing the object types supported  by UL4. It is extensible to allow encoding/decoding arbitrary instances  (i.e. it is basically a reimplementation of ``pickle``, but with string  input/output instead of bytes and with an eye towards cross-plattform  support).  There are implementations for Python, Java and Javascript.* ``ll.orasql`` provides utilities for working with cx_Oracle_:  - It allows calling functions and procedures with keyword arguments.  - Query results will be put into Record objects, where database fields    are accessible as object attributes.  - The ``Connection`` class provides methods for iterating through the    database metadata.  - Importing the modules adds support for URLs with the scheme ``oracle`` to    ``ll.url``.  .. _cx_Oracle: https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_Oracle/* ``ll.make`` is an object oriented make replacement. Like make it allows  you to specify dependencies between files and actions to be executed  when files don't exist or are out of date with respect to one  of their sources. But unlike make you can do this in a object oriented  way and targets are not only limited to files.* ``ll.color`` provides classes and functions for handling RGB color values.  This includes the ability to convert between different color models  (RGB, HSV, HLS) as well as to and from CSS format, and several functions  for modifying and mixing colors.* ``ll.sisyphus`` provides classes for running Python scripts as cron jobs.* ``ll.url`` provides classes for parsing and constructing RFC 2396  compliant URLs.* ``ll.nightshade`` can be used to serve the output of PL/SQL  functions/procedures with CherryPy__.* ``ll.misc`` provides several small utility functions and classes.* ``ll.astyle`` can be used for colored terminal output (via ANSI escape  sequences).* ``ll.daemon`` can be used on UNIX to fork a daemon process.* ``ll.xml_codec`` contains a complete codec for encoding and decoding XML.__ http://www.cherrypy.org/Changes in 5.75 (released 2023-11-21)-------------------------------------* In UL4 ``&lt;?doc?&gt;`` and ``&lt;?note?&gt;`` can now be nested, and otherwise can  contain anything up to the matching ``&lt;?end doc?&gt;`` or ``&lt;?end note?&gt;`` tag,  but only if the initial ``&lt;?doc?&gt;`` or ``&lt;?note?&gt;`` tag contains only  whitespace (e.g. ``&lt;?doc    ?&gt;`` etc.). This makes it possible to have source  code examples in ``&lt;?doc?&gt;`` or ``&lt;?note?&gt;`` tags.* Added a new class ``BoundTemplate`` to ``ll.ul4c``: This is an UL4  template bound to an object.  Calling or rendering a ``BoundTemplate`` instance passes the object  to which the template is bound as the first positional argument.* Add attribute ``namespace`` to UL4 templates.* Add method ``timestamp`` to UL4 type ``datetime``.* The UL4 function ``getattr`` now returns an ``UndefinedKey`` object when  accessing an undefined attribute and no default value is passed.* The result of calling ``dir()`` on an object in UL4 can now be customized  by implementing ``ul4_dir()``.* Updated UL4 and UL4ON test infrastructure to work around problems with gradle.* Replace a check for the ElementTree method ``getchildren`` with a check  for ``findall`` in ``xml2xsc.iterpath`` since ``getchildren``  has been removed in Python 3.9.* Copied the implementation of ``cgi.parse_header`` to ``ll.misc``  since ``cgi.parse_header`` will be deprecated in Python 3.13.  (``cgi.parse_header`` is used by ``ll.url``, ``ll.xist.ns.html``  and ``ll.xist.ns.jsp``).</longdescription>
