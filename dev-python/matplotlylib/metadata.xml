If you want to make changes to this code,you'll probably want to go this route.To get started you need to grab a copy of the `matplotlylib repo`_. Themakefile included in this is all you need to get setup. Just do the following::    $ make build    $ make installThe first instruction will grab mplexporter and move it into the matplotlylibdirectory.The second instruction will install the matplotlylib package, which now hasmplexporter built into it.IPython notebook~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The project page has an extensive `IPython notebook`_ with example usage.Or, have a look at our `plotly profile`_, where you can open and edit all ofthe examples.
