	<longdescription># Making With Code CLIThis package provides the command-line tool `mwc` which accompanies the Making With Codeintroductory Computer Science curriculum. `mwc` helps students configure their computers, sets up git repositories for course assignemnts, and provides helpers for other course taskslike running tests and accessing the curriculum.Teachers will be able to use `mwc` to adminster their courses, including tools for feedback and assessment. The overall goal of the project is to provide computational infrastructure to teachersand schools allowing them to teach CS through open-ended projects using real tools, supporting personal relationships with powerful ideas and rich computing cultures. ## Usage`mwc` can be installed via pip. However, if you're a student or teacher using Making With Code, there is a separate bootstrapping process you should follow. Please consult your curriculum website (or ask your teacher) for detailed instructions on how and why to use this tool.     pip3 install making-with-code-cliOnce installed, you can set up your computer using the `mwc setup` command. Run `mwc --help` to see all the commands available.  ## ContactIf you're interested in computing education and want to learn more about Making With Code, please contact [Dr. Chris Proctor](https://chrisproctor.net).</longdescription>
