	<longdescription>zfec -- efficient, portable erasure coding tool===============================================Generate redundant blocks of information such that if some of the blocks arelost then the original data can be recovered from the remaining blocks. Thispackage includes command-line tools, C API, Python API, and Haskell API.|build| |test| |pypi|Intro and Licence-----------------This package implements an &quot;erasure code&quot;, or &quot;forward error correctioncode&quot;.You may use this package under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or,at your option, any later version.  You may use this package under theTransitive Grace Period Public Licence, version 1.0 or, at your option, anylater version.  (You may choose to use this package under the terms of eitherlicence, at your option.)  See the file COPYING.GPL for the terms of the GNUGeneral Public License, version 2.  See the file COPYING.TGPPL.rst for theterms of the Transitive Grace Period Public Licence, version 1.0.The most widely known example of an erasure code is the RAID-5 algorithmwhich makes it so that in the event of the loss of any one hard drive, thestored data can be completely recovered.  The algorithm in the zfec packagehas a similar effect, but instead of recovering from the loss of only asingle element, it can be parameterized to choose in advance the number ofelements whose loss it can tolerate.This package is largely based on the old &quot;fec&quot; library by Luigi Rizzo et al.,which is a mature and optimized implementation of erasure coding.  The zfecpackage makes several changes from the original &quot;fec&quot; package, includingaddition of the Python API, refactoring of the C API to support zero-copyoperation, a few clean-ups and optimizations of the core code itself, and theaddition of a command-line tool named &quot;zfec&quot;.Installation------------``pip install zfec``To run the self-tests, execute ``tox`` from an unpacked source tree or git checkout.To run the tests of the Haskell API: ``runhaskell haskell/test/FECTest.hs``Note that in order to run the Haskell API tests you must have installed thelibrary first due to the fact that the interpreter cannot process FEC.hs asit takes a reference to an FFI function.Community---------The source is currently available via git on the web with the command:``git clone https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/zfec``Please post about zfec to the Tahoe-LAFS mailing list and contribute patches:&lt;https://tahoe-lafs.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tahoe-dev&gt;If you find a bug in zfec, please open an issue on github:&lt;https://github.com/tahoe-lafs/zfec/issues&gt;Overview--------This package performs two operations, encoding and decoding.  Encoding takessome input data and expands its size by producing extra &quot;check blocks&quot;, alsocalled &quot;secondary blocks&quot;.  Decoding takes some data -- any combination ofblocks of the original data (called &quot;primary blocks&quot;) and &quot;secondary blocks&quot;,and produces the original data.The encoding is parameterized by two integers, k and m.  m is the totalnumber of blocks produced, and k is how many of those blocks are necessary toreconstruct the original data.  m is required to be at least 1 and at most256, and k is required to be at least 1 and at most m.(Note that when k == m then there is no point in doing erasure coding -- itdegenerates to the equivalent of the Unix &quot;split&quot; utility which simply splitsthe input into successive segments.  Similarly, when k == 1 it degenerates tothe equivalent of the unix &quot;cp&quot; utility -- each block is a complete copy ofthe input data.)Note that each &quot;primary block&quot; is a segment of the original data, so its sizeis 1/k'th of the size of original data, and each &quot;secondary block&quot; is of thesame size, so the total space used by all the blocks is m/k times the size ofthe original data (plus some padding to fill out the last primary block to bethe same size as all the others).  In addition to the data contained in theblocks themselves there are also a few pieces of metadata which are necessaryfor later reconstruction.  Those pieces are: 1.  the value of K, 2.  thevalue of M, 3.  the sharenum of each block, 4.  the number of bytes ofpadding that were used.  The &quot;zfec&quot; command-line tool compresses these piecesof data and prepends them to the beginning of each share, so each thesharefile produced by the &quot;zfec&quot; command-line tool is between one and fourbytes larger than the share data alone.The decoding step requires as input k of the blocks which were produced bythe encoding step.  The decoding step produces as output the data that wasearlier input to the encoding step.Command-Line Tool-----------------The bin/ directory contains two Unix-style, command-line tools &quot;zfec&quot; and&quot;zunfec&quot;.  Execute ``zfec --help`` or ``zunfec --help`` for usageinstructions.Performance-----------To run the benchmarks, execute the included bench/bench_zfec.py script withoptional --k= and --m= arguments.On my Athlon 64 2.4 GHz workstation (running Linux), the &quot;zfec&quot; command-linetool encoded a 160 MB file with m=100, k=94 (about 6% redundancy) in 3.9seconds, where the &quot;par2&quot; tool encoded the file with about 6% redundancy in27 seconds.  zfec encoded the same file with m=12, k=6 (100% redundancy) in4.1 seconds, where par2 encoded it with about 100% redundancy in 7 minutesand 56 seconds.The underlying C library in benchmark mode encoded from a file at about 4.9million bytes per second and decoded at about 5.8 million bytes per second.On Peter's fancy Intel Mac laptop (2.16 GHz Core Duo), it encoded from a fileat about 6.2 million bytes per second.On my even fancier Intel Mac laptop (2.33 GHz Core Duo), it encoded from afile at about 6.8 million bytes per second.On my old PowerPC G4 867 MHz Mac laptop, it encoded from a file at about 1.3million bytes per second.Here is a paper analyzing the performance of various erasure codes and theirimplementations, including zfec:http://www.usenix.org/events/fast09/tech/full_papers/plank/plank.pdfZfec shows good performance on different machines and with different valuesof K and M. It also has a nice small memory footprint.API---Each block is associated with &quot;blocknum&quot;.  The blocknum of each primary blockis its index (starting from zero), so the 0'th block is the first primaryblock, which is the first few bytes of the file, the 1'st block is the nextprimary block, which is the next few bytes of the file, and so on.  The lastprimary block has blocknum k-1.  The blocknum of each secondary block is anarbitrary integer between k and 255 inclusive.  (When using the Python API,if you don't specify which secondary blocks you want when invoking encode(),then it will by default provide the blocks with ids from k to m-1 inclusive.)- C API  fec_encode() takes as input an array of k pointers, where each pointer  points to a memory buffer containing the input data (i.e., the i'th buffer  contains the i'th primary block).  There is also a second parameter which  is an array of the blocknums of the secondary blocks which are to be  produced.  (Each element in that array is required to be the blocknum of a  secondary block, i.e. it is required to be &gt;= k and &lt; m.)  The output from fec_encode() is the requested set of secondary blocks which  are written into output buffers provided by the caller.  Note that this fec_encode() is a &quot;low-level&quot; API in that it requires the  input data to be provided in a set of memory buffers of exactly the right  sizes.  If you are starting instead with a single buffer containing all of  the data then please see easyfec.py's &quot;class Encoder&quot; as an example of how  to split a single large buffer into the appropriate set of input buffers  for fec_encode().  If you are starting with a file on disk, then please see  filefec.py's encode_file_stringy_easyfec() for an example of how to read  the data from a file and pass it to &quot;class Encoder&quot;.  The Python interface  provides these higher-level operations, as does the Haskell interface.  If  you implement functions to do these higher-level tasks in other languages,  please send a patch to tahoe-dev@tahoe-lafs.org so that your API can be  included in future releases of zfec.  fec_decode() takes as input an array of k pointers, where each pointer  points to a buffer containing a block.  There is also a separate input  parameter which is an array of blocknums, indicating the blocknum of each  of the blocks which is being passed in.  The output from fec_decode() is the set of primary blocks which were  missing from the input and had to be reconstructed.  These reconstructed  blocks are written into output buffers provided by the caller.- Python API  encode() and decode() take as input a sequence of k buffers, where a  &quot;sequence&quot; is any object that implements the Python sequence protocol (such  as a list or tuple) and a &quot;buffer&quot; is any object that implements the Python  buffer protocol (such as a string or array).  The contents that are  required to be present in these buffers are the same as for the C API.  encode() also takes a list of desired blocknums.  Unlike the C API, the  Python API accepts blocknums of primary blocks as well as secondary blocks  in its list of desired blocknums.  encode() returns a list of buffer  objects which contain the blocks requested.  For each requested block which  is a primary block, the resulting list contains a reference to the  apppropriate primary block from the input list.  For each requested block  which is a secondary block, the list contains a newly created string object  containing that block.  decode() also takes a list of integers indicating the blocknums of the  blocks being passed int.  decode() returns a list of buffer objects which  contain all of the primary blocks of the original data (in order).  For  each primary block which was present in the input list, then the result  list simply contains a reference to the object that was passed in the input  list.  For each primary block which was not present in the input, the  result list contains a newly created string object containing that primary  block.  Beware of a &quot;gotcha&quot; that can result from the combination of mutable data  and the fact that the Python API returns references to inputs when  possible.  Returning references to its inputs is efficient since it avoids making an  unnecessary copy of the data, but if the object which was passed as input  is mutable and if that object is mutated after the call to zfec returns,  then the result from zfec -- which is just a reference to that same object  -- will also be mutated.  This subtlety is the price you pay for avoiding  data copying.  If you don't want to have to worry about this then you can  simply use immutable objects (e.g. Python strings) to hold the data that  you pass to zfec.- Haskell API  The Haskell code is fully Haddocked, to generate the documentation, run  ``runhaskell Setup.lhs haddock``.Utilities---------The filefec.py module has a utility function for efficiently reading a fileand encoding it piece by piece.  This module is used by the &quot;zfec&quot; and&quot;zunfec&quot; command-line tools from the bin/ directory.Dependencies------------A C compiler is required.  To use the Python API or the command-line tools aPython interpreter is also required.  We have tested it with Python v2.7,v3.5 and v3.6.  For the Haskell interface, GHC &gt;= 6.8.1 is required.Acknowledgements----------------Thanks to the author of the original fec lib, Luigi Rizzo, and the folks thatcontributed to it: Phil Karn, Robert Morelos-Zaragoza, Hari Thirumoorthy, andDan Rubenstein.

Other Unix-styletools that go well with zfec include `GNU tar`_ for archiving multiple filesand directories into one file, `lzip`_ for compression, and `GNU PrivacyGuard`_ for encryption or `b2sum`_ for integrity.  It is important to dothings in order: first archive, then compress, then either encrypt orintegrity-check, then erasure code.  Note that if GNU Privacy Guard is usedfor privacy, then it will also ensure integrity, so the use of b2sum isunnecessary in that case. Note also that you also need to do integritychecking (such as with b2sum) on the blocks that result from the erasurecoding in *addition* to doing it on the file contents! (There are twodifferent subtle failure modes -- see &quot;more than one file can match animmutable file cap&quot; on the `Hack Tahoe-LAFS!`_ Hall of Fame.)The `Tahoe-LAFS`_ project uses zfec as part of a complete distributedfilesystem with integrated encryption, integrity, remote distribution of theblocks, directory structure, backup of changed files or directories, accesscontrol, immutable files and directories, proof-of-retrievability, and repairof damaged files and directories.`fecpp`_ is an alternative to zfec.
