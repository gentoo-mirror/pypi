	<longdescription>AtomMan=======Atomistic Manipulation ToolkitAtomMan: the Atomistic Manipulation Toolkit is a Python library forcreating, representing, manipulating, and analyzing large-scale atomicsystems of atoms. The focus of the package is to facilitate the rapid designand development of simulations that are fully documented and easily adaptableto new potentials, configurations, etc.  The code has no requirements thatlimit which systems it can be used on, i.e. it should work on Linux, Mac andWindows computers.Features:1. Allows for efficient and fast calculations on millions of atoms, each with   many freely defined per-atom properties.2. Built-in tools for generating and analyzing crystalline defects, such as   point defects, stacking faults, and dislocations.4. Call LAMMPS directly from Python and instantly retrieve the resulting data   or LAMMPS error statement.5. Easily convert systems to/from the other Python atomic representations, such   as ase.Atoms and pymatgen.Structure.6. Can read and dump crystal structure information from a number of formats,   such as LAMMPS data and dump files, and POSCAR.7. Built-in unit conversions.Installation------------The atomman package is compatible with Python 3.7+.The latest release can be installed using pip::    pip install atommanor using conda from the conda-forge channel::    conda install -c conda-forge atommanFor Windows users, it is recommended to use an Anaconda distribution and useconda to install numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas and cython prior toinstalling atomman.Alternatively, all code and documentation can be downloaded from GitHub.- The stable releases are available at  `https://github.com/usnistgov/atomman &lt;https://github.com/usnistgov/atomman&gt;`__.- The working development versions are at  `https://github.com/lmhale99/atomman &lt;https://github.com/lmhale99/atomman&gt;`__.    Documentation-------------Web-based documentation for the atomman package is available at`https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/atomman &lt;https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/atomman&gt;`__.Source code for the documentation can be found in the`github doc directory &lt;https://github.com/usnistgov/atomman/tree/master/doc/&gt;`__.The doc directory contains the information both as the source RestructuredTextfiles and as unformatted HTML. If you download a copy, you can view the HTMLversion offline by    cd {atomman_path}/doc/html    python -m http.serverThen, opening localhost:8000 in a web browser.The documentation consists of two main components:1. **Tutorial Jupyter Notebooks:**   `Online html version &lt;https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/atomman/tutorial/index.html&gt;`__,   `Downloadable Notebook version &lt;https://github.com/usnistgov/atomman/tree/master/doc/tutorial&gt;`__.   The tutorials starting with ##. provide a general overview/example of the   various capabilities.  The tutorials starting with ##.#. give more detailed   descriptions and list options available to the tools mentioned in the   overview tutorials.2. **Code Documentation:**   `Online html version &lt;https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/atomman/atomman.html&gt;`__.   This provides a rendering of the Python docstrings for the included   functions and classes.Optional packages-----------------This is a list of additional Python packages that are needed for some of theoptional features of the package.- `diffpy.Structure &lt;http://www.diffpy.org/diffpy.Structure/&gt;`__:  CIF reader. Required for loading systems from CIF files.- `ase &lt;https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/&gt;`__:  The Atomic Simulation Environment for interacting with small systems  and DFT calculations. Required for converting to/from ase.Atoms objects.- `pymatgen &lt;http://pymatgen.org/&gt;`__:  The Python Materials Genomics package used by the Materials  Project for DFT calculations. Required for converting to/from  pymatgen.Structure objects.- `spglib &lt;https://atztogo.github.io/spglib/python-spglib.html&gt;`__:  A Python interface to the spglib spacegroup analysis code.  spglib  can be used to analyze and determine the spacegroup for an atomic system.  Required for converting to/from spglib.cell objects.</longdescription>
