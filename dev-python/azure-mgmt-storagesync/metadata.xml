	<longdescription>## Microsoft Azure SDK for PythonThis is the Microsoft Azure Storage Sync Client Library.Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the next generation of management APIsthat replace the old Azure Service Management (ASM).This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.For the older Azure Service Management (ASM) libraries, see[azure-servicemanagement-legacy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicemanagement-legacy)library.For a more complete set of Azure libraries, see the[azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).## UsageTo learn how to use this package, see the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)For docs and references, see [Python SDK References](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/)Code samples for this package can be found at [Storage Sync Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&amp;term=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing&amp;terms=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing) on docs.microsoft.com.Additional code samples for different Azure services are available at [Samples Repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)## Provide FeedbackIf you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue inthe [Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)section of the project.![image](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2Fazure-mgmt-storagesync%2FREADME.png)# Release History## 1.0.0 (2021-04-07) - GA release## 1.0.0b1 (2020-12-03)This is beta preview version.This version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).**General breaking changes**- Credential system has been completly revamped:  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user  - For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)**General new features**- Type annotations support using `typing`. SDKs are mypy ready.- This client has now stable and official support for async. Check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.- This client now support natively tracing library like OpenCensus or OpenTelemetry. See this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.## 0.2.0 (2020-01-09)**Features**  - Model ServerEndpoint has a new parameter recall_status  - Model ServerEndpoint has a new parameter cloud_tiering_status  - Model CloudEndpointCreateParameters has a new parameter    friendly_name  - Added operation CloudEndpointsOperations.trigger_change_detection  - Added operation group OperationStatusOperations**General Breaking Changes**This version uses a next-generation code generator that might introducebreaking changes if from some import. In summary, some modules wereincorrectly visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed severalissues caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used inthe first place. StorageSyncManagementClient cannot be imported fromazure.mgmt.storagesync.storage_sync_management_client anymore (importfrom azure.mgmt.storagesync works like before)StorageSyncManagementClientConfiguration import has been moved fromazure.mgmt.storagesync.storage_sync_management_client toazure.mgmt.storagesync A model MyClass from a &quot;models&quot; sub-module cannotbe imported anymore using azure.mgmt.storagesync.models.my_class(import from azure.mgmt.storagesync.models works like before) Anoperation class MyClassOperations from an operations sub-module cannotbe imported anymore usingazure.mgmt.storagesync.operations.my_class_operations (import fromazure.mgmt.storagesync.operations works like before) Last but not least,HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default. You should always usea client as a context manager, or call close(), or use no more than oneclient per process.## 0.1.0 (2019-04-05)  - Initial Release</longdescription>
