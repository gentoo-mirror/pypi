	<longdescription>========================================pyth - Python text markup and conversion========================================Pyth is intended to make it easy to convert marked-up text between different common formats.*Marked-up text* means text which has:* Paragraphs* Headings* Bold, italic, and underlined text* Hyperlinks* Bullet lists* Simple tables* Very little elseFormats I initially want to support are:* xhtml* rtf* pdf (output)These three formats cover web, Word / OpenOffice, and print. Design principles=================* Ignore unsupported information in input formats (e.g. page layout)* Ignore font issues -- output in a single font.* Ignore specific text sizes -- support relative sizes (bigger, littler) only. Output in a single base size.* Have no dependencies unless they are written in Python, and work* Make it easy to add support for new formats, by using an architecture based on *plugins* and *adapters*.Examples========See http://github.com/brendonh/pyth/tree/master/examples/Unit tests==========The sources contains some unit tests (written using python unittestmodule) in the 'tests' directory.To run the tests we can either run them individually as python script,either use `python nose`_.  If using nose then we just need to go intothe tests directory and invoke nosetest from there (make sure thatpyth module is in PYTHONPATH)... _python nose: http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/</longdescription>
