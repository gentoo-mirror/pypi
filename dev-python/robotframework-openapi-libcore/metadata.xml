	<longdescription>------# OpenApiLibCore for Robot FrameworkThe OpenApiLibCore library is a utility library that is meant to simplify creationof other Robot Framework libraries for API testing based on the information inan OpenAPI document (also known as Swagger document).This document explains how to use the OpenApiLibCore library.My RoboCon 2022 talk about OpenApiDriver and OpenApiLibCore can be found[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YWZEHxk9Ps)For more information about Robot Framework, see http://robotframework.org.---&gt; Note: OpenApiLibCore is still being developed so there are currentlyrestrictions / limitations that you may encounter when using this library to runtests against an API. See [Limitations](#limitations) for details.---## InstallationIf you already have Python &gt;= 3.8 with pip installed, you can simply run:`pip install --upgrade robotframework-openapi-libcore`---## OpenAPI (aka Swagger)The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interfaceto RESTful APIs, see https://swagger.io/specification/The OpenApiLibCore implements a number of Robot Framework keywords that make iteasy to interact with an OpenAPI implementation by using the information in theopenapi document (Swagger file), for examply by automatic generation of valid valuesfor requests based on the schema information in the document.&gt; Note: OpenApiLibCore is designed for APIs based on the OAS v3The library has not been tested for APIs based on the OAS v2.---## Getting startedBefore trying to use the keywords exposed by OpenApiLibCore on the target APIit's recommended to first ensure that the openapi document for the API is validunder the OpenAPI Specification.This can be done using the command line interface of a package that is installed asa prerequisite for OpenApiLibCore.Both a local openapi.json or openapi.yaml file or one hosted by the API servercan be checked using the `prance validate &lt;reference_to_file&gt;` shell command:```shellprance validate --backend=openapi-spec-validator http://localhost:8000/openapi.jsonProcessing &quot;http://localhost:8000/openapi.json&quot;... -&gt; Resolving external references.Validates OK as OpenAPI 3.0.2!prance validate --backend=openapi-spec-validator /tests/files/petstore_openapi.yamlProcessing &quot;/tests/files/petstore_openapi.yaml&quot;... -&gt; Resolving external references.Validates OK as OpenAPI 3.0.2!```You'll have to change the url or file reference to the location of the openapidocument for your API.&gt; Note: Although recursion is technically allowed under the OAS, tool support is limitedand changing the OAS to not use recursion is recommended.OpenApiLibCore has limited support for parsing OpenAPI documents withrecursion in them. See the `recursion_limit` and `recursion_default` parameters.If the openapi document passes this validation, the next step is trying to do a testrun with a minimal test suite.The example below can be used, with `source`, `origin` and 'endpoint' altered tofit your situation.``` robotframework*** Settings ***Library            OpenApiLibCore...                    source=http://localhost:8000/openapi.json...                    origin=http://localhost:8000*** Test Cases ***Getting Started    ${url}=    Get Valid Url    endpoint=/employees/{employee_id}   method=get```Running the above suite for the first time may result in an error / failed test.You should look at the Robot Framework `log.html` to determine the reasonsfor the failing tests.Depending on the reasons for the failures, different solutions are possible.Details about the OpenApiLibCore library parameters and keywords that you may need can be found[here](https://marketsquare.github.io/robotframework-openapi-libcore/openapi_libcore.html).The OpenApiLibCore also support handling of relations between resources within the scopeof the API being validated as well as handling dependencies on resources outside thescope of the API. In addition there is support for handling restrictions on the valuesof parameters and properties.Details about the `mappings_path` variable usage can be found[here](https://marketsquare.github.io/robotframework-openapi-libcore/advanced_use.html).---## LimitationsThere are currently a number of limitations to supported API structures, supporteddata types and properties. The following list details the most important ones:- Only JSON request and response bodies are supported.- No support for per-endpoint authorization levels.- Parsing of OAS 3.1 documents is supported by the parsing tools, but runtime behavior is untested.</longdescription>
