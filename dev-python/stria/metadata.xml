According to the motif length, tandem repeatscan be classified as microsatellites and minisatellites. Microsatellites are also known as simple sequencerepeats (SSRs) or short tandem repeats (STRs) with motif length of 1-6 bp. Minisatellites are also sometimesreferred to as variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) has longer motif length than micorsatellites.The ``stria`` is a lightweight Python C extension for identification and analysis of short tandem repeats.The ``stria`` enables to fastly identify both exact and imperfect SSRs and VNTRs from large numbers of DNA sequences.The ``stria`` also provides command line tools for users to extract tandem repeats from Fasta files.Usage=====.. code:: python&gt;&gt;&gt; import stria&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyfastx&gt;&gt;&gt; for name, seq, _ in pyfastx.Fastx('test.fa.gz'):&gt;&gt;&gt; for ssr in SSRMiner(name, seq):&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ssr.as_string())Documentation=============`https://stria.readthedocs.io/ &lt;https://stria.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_</longdescription>
