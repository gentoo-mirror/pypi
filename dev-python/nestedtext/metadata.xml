It organizes the data into a nested collection of dictionaries, lists, and strings without the need for quoting or escaping.  A unique feature of this file format is that it only supports one scalar type: strings.Â  While the decision to eschew integer, real, date, etc. types may seem counter intuitive, it leads to simpler data files and applications that are more robust.*NestedText* is convenient for configuration files, address books, account information, and the like.  Because there is no need for quoting or escaping, it is particularly nice for holding code fragments.  Here is an example of a file that contains a few addresses:.. code-block:: nestedtext    # Contact information for our officers    Katheryn McDaniel:        position: president        address:            &gt; 138 Almond Street            &gt; Topeka, Kansas 20697        phone:            cell: 1-210-555-5297            home: 1-210-555-8470                # Katheryn prefers that we always call her on her cell phone.        email: KateMcD@aol.com        additional roles:            - board member    Margaret Hodge:        position: vice president        address:            &gt; 2586 Marigold Lane            &gt; Topeka, Kansas 20682        phone: 1-470-555-0398        email: margaret.hodge@ku.edu        additional roles:            - new membership task force            - accounting task forceOne of the more attractive use-cases for *NestedText* is command line programs whose output is meant to be consumed by either people or programs.  Many programs do so by supporting a ``--json`` command-line flag that indicates the output should be computer readable rather than human readable.  But, with *NestedText* it is not necessary to make people choose.  Just output the result in *NestedText* and it can be read by people or computers.  For example, consider a program that read your address list and output particular fields on demand::    &gt; address --email    Katheryn McDaniel: KateMcD@aol.com    Margaret Hodge: margaret.hodge@ku.eduThis could output could be fed directly into another program that accepted input as *NestedText*::    &gt; address --email | mail-to-listContributing------------This package contains a Python reference implementation of *NestedText* and a test suite.  Implementation in many languages is required for *NestedText* to catch on widely.  If you like the format, please consider contributing additional implementations.Also, please consider using *NestedText* for any applications you create.  It is especially suitable for configuration files.</longdescription>
