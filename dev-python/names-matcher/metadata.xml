	<longdescription># names-matcher[![Build Status](https://github.com/athenianco/names-matcher/workflows/Push/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/athenianco/names-matcher/actions)[![Code coverage](https://codecov.io/github/athenianco/names-matcher/coverage.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/athenianco/names-matcher)[![PyPI package](https://badgen.net/pypi/v/names-matcher)](https://pypi.org/project/names-matcher/)Fuzzily biject people's names between two lists.Let's define an identity as a series of names belonging to the same person. The algorithm is:1. Parse, normalize, and split names in each identity. The result is a set of strings per each.2. Define the similarity between identities as `max(ratio, token_set_ratio)`, where `ratio` \   and `token_set_ratio` are inspired by string comparison functions from [rapidfuzz](https://github.com/maxbachmann/RapidFuzz).3. Construct the distance matrix between identities in two specified lists.4. Solve the Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) on that matrix.Our LAP's solution scales up to ~1000-s of identities.Example:```&gt;&gt;&gt; from names_matcher import NamesMatcher&gt;&gt;&gt; NamesMatcher()([[&quot;Vadim Markovtsev&quot;, &quot;vmarkovtsev&quot;], [&quot;Long, Waren&quot;, &quot;warenlg&quot;]], \                    [[&quot;Warren&quot;], [&quot;VMarkovtsev&quot;], [&quot;Eiso Kant&quot;]])(array([1, 0], dtype=int32), array([0.75      , 0.57142857]))```The first resulting tuple element is the mapping indexes: of same length as the first sequence,with indexes in the second sequence. The second element is the corresponding confidence valuesfrom 0 to 1.### Installation```pip3 install names-matcher```### Command line interfaceGiven one identity per line in two files, print the matches to standard output:```python3 -m names_matcher path/to/file/1 path/to/file/2```Each identity is several names merged with `|`, for example:```Vadim Markovtsev|vmarkovtsev|vadim```### ContributingContributions are very welcome and desired!
