Inspired by [Walrus](https://github.com/coleifer/walrus) and implemented with [aioredis](https://github.com/aio-libs/aioredis-py).Cache Money is used through a decorator you can add to your function that needs to be cached. When the decorator gets executed, Cache Money will make a unique key from the name of the function and the params received and look up in redis if there is a result for this key. If there is a result it will be used as the output of the function and the execution of the function will be skipped.You can add a timeout in the declaration of the decorator, you can find constants for common timeout duration in `cache_money/constants.py`. When the timeout is reached, Redis remove the entry itself.It's also possible to clear the cache early by using the method bust that gets added to a function decorated by Cache Money. An example is provided below.This library is available on PyPI under the name cache-money. You can install with pip by running `pip install cache-money`.# RequirementsYou need a redis instance running to use this library. This library was tested to run on version of Redis &gt;= 4.0.0. If you have docker set up you can create a redis instance like this:```shellmake redis-start```# Usage## Basic usageFirst thing is initializing Cache Money and decorating a function that you want to cache```pythonfrom cache_money import cache_money, init_cache_moneyfrom cache_money.constants import CACHE_HOUR, CACHE_WEEKinit_cache_money(host=&quot;localhost&quot;)@cache_money.cached(timeout=CACHE_HOUR)async def addition(x: int, y: int) -&gt; int:    return x + y@cache_money.cached(timeout=CACHE_WEEK)async def multiplication(x: int, y: int) -&gt; int:    return x * y```If you run the following calls to the function `addition` consecutively:```doctest  &gt;&gt;&gt; await addition(3, 4)  7    &gt;&gt;&gt; await addition(3, 7)  10   &gt;&gt;&gt; await addition(3, 4)  7```The first and second call would be executed, but the third call would have used the cache in redis instead, as long as the third call was done within one hour of when the first call was made, as the function addition is caching results for one hour.In Redis you would see two entries like this:```shell# redis-cli 127.0.0.1:6379&gt; KEYS *1) &quot;__main__:addition:ea53056bad64a599c84efdfd4f4cbb64&quot;2) &quot;__main__:addition:bb6b7afb6a6cf3191f6d7fd35d976d42&quot;127.0.0.1:6379&gt; TTL addition:ea53056bad64a599c84efdfd4f4cbb64(integer) 3403```## Busting cache for a specific function callYou can force expire (bust) the cache for a specific function call```doctest&gt;&gt; await addition(3, 4)&gt;&gt; await addition(3, 7)&gt;&gt; await addition.bust(3, 4)```In Redis you would see one entry as the other one has been busted```shell127.0.0.1:6379&gt; KEYS *1) &quot;__main__:addition:bb6b7afb6a6cf3191f6d7fd35d976d42&quot;```## Busting cache for all function calls of a specific functionYou can bust the cache for all instance of a function call```doctest&gt;&gt; await addition(3, 4)&gt;&gt; await addition(3, 7)&gt;&gt; await multiplication(2, 4)&gt;&gt; await addition.bust_all()```In Redis you would see no entries for the function `addition` which has been busted,you would see one entry for `multiplication````shell127.0.0.1:6379&gt; KEYS *1) &quot;__main__:multiplication:bc3b7afc6a7cf3191f6d1fd31d810d55&quot;```## Busting cache for all function calls of all functionsYou can bust the cache of all entries made by Cache Money as well```doctest&gt;&gt; await addition(3, 4)&gt;&gt; await addition(3, 7)&gt;&gt; await multiplication(2, 4)&gt;&gt; cache_money.bust()```In Redis you would see no entries```shell127.0.0.1:6379&gt; KEYS *(empty array)```## Contributing and getting set up for local developmentTo set yourself up for development on Cache Money, make sure you are using[poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/) and simply run the following commands from the root directory:```shellmake sys-depsmake install```</longdescription>
