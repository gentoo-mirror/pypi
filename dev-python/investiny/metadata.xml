	<longdescription># ü§èüèª `investiny` is `investpy` but made tiny**`investiny` is faster, lighter, and easier to use** than `investpy`.`investiny` has been created due to the latest Investing.com changes in their API protection protocols, as now their main APIs are Cloudflare V2 protected. Anyway, there are still some APIs working fine, so this packagehas been created as a temporary replacement for `investpy` while we get to an agreement to continue the developmentof `investpy`. In the meantime, anyone can use `investiny` as I'm actively working on it, and ideally, it should supportmost of the functionality provided by `investpy`.---## ü§î What are the differences with `investpy`?**`investiny` is faster, lighter and easier to use**, but with reduced functionality for the moment. `investiny` lets you retrieve historical data from Investing.com through `historical_data` and search any available assetthrough `search_assets`, while `investpy` offers more functions to also retrieve technical indicators, economiccalendars, dividends, etc. but those will come at some point to `investiny` too.`investiny` introduces intraday data, so the specified intervals when retrieving historical data for any assetavailable at Investing.com goes from 1 minute to monthly data.`investpy` uses Investing.com's APIs at https://www.investing.com/instruments/HistoricalDataAjax and athttps://api.investing.com/api/financialdata/historical, that are Cloudflare protected and not working any more,as you'll end up getting blocked with 403 Forbidden HTTP code; while `investiny` is using https://tvc6.investing.com/,which seems to be more reliable right now according to the ran tests, as well as providing intraday data.| | Intraday Data | Any Range Historical Data | Search Assets/Quotes | Dividends | Economic Calendar | Technical Indicators | Economic News ||:--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|| **investiny** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå || **investpy**  | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |---## üõ†Ô∏è Installation`investiny` requires Python 3.8+ and can be installed with `pip` as it follows:`pip install investiny`---## üíª UsageRetrieve historical data from Investing.com using the Investing.com ID of the assetthat you want to retrieve the data from.```pythonfrom investiny import historical_datadata = historical_data(investing_id=6408, from_date=&quot;09/01/2022&quot;, to_date=&quot;10/01/2022&quot;) # Returns AAPL historical data as JSON (without date)```There's also a function to look for assets in Investing.com, that also lets you retrievethe Investing.com ID that you can, later on, use in `historical_data` as an input parameter.```pythonfrom investiny import search_assetsresults = search_assets(query=&quot;AAPL&quot;, limit=1, type=&quot;Stock&quot;, exchange=&quot;NASDAQ&quot;) # Returns a list with all the results found in Investing.com```As `search_assets` returns a list of results, you can check each of them, retrieve the `ticker` from theasset that you want to retrieve historical data from and pass it as a parameter to `historical_data`. So on, thecombination of both functions should look like the following:```pythonfrom investiny import historical_data, search_assetssearch_results = search_assets(query=&quot;AAPL&quot;, limit=1, type=&quot;Stock&quot;, exchange=&quot;NASDAQ&quot;)investing_id = int(search_results[0][&quot;ticker&quot;]) # Assuming the first entry is the desired one (top result in Investing.com)data = historical_data(investing_id=investing_id, from_date=&quot;09/01/2022&quot;, to_date=&quot;10/01/2022&quot;)```## ‚ö†Ô∏è DisclaimerInvesting.com is a registered trademark of Investing.com, and its services are offered by Fusion Media Limited.Neither `investpy` nor `investiny` is affiliated, endorsed, or vetted by Investing.com.Both `investpy` and `investiny` are open-source packages that use Investing.com's available data, intended for research and educational purposes only.You should refer to Investing.com's terms and conditions at https://www.investing.com/about-us/terms-and-conditions for details on your rights to use the actual data, as it is intended for personal use only.</longdescription>
