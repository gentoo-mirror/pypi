	<longdescription>&gt; # Looking for new maintainer&gt;&gt; Life and career have taken me in a different direction and I no longer have time to keep this updated. I've attempted to get this merged back into the original with no success. If you're interested in continuing this then let me know.# pyfatsecret![status](https://badge.fury.io/py/fatsecret.svg)This library provides a lightweight python wrapper for the Fatsecret API with the goal of making it easier to visualize the data retrieved from the API. To that end, this library will usually return lists of identical elements for ease of plotting, discarding extra header fields that the Fatsecret API otherwise includes. All API calls return either a single or list of JSON dictionaries.## InstallationInstall the module via pip```sh$ pip install fatsecret```or easy_install::```sh$ easy_install fatsecret```## ConfigRegister for a developer account at [Fatsecret](https://platform.fatsecret.com/api/). You will need your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret key for your application.## UsageFatsecret supports both delegated and public calls. Only through delegated calls can you access Fatsecret user profile data.If you're only interested in the public data you only require a session to make HTTP requests:```pyfrom fatsecret import Fatsecretfs = Fatsecret(consumer_key, consumer_secret)```Once you have created a session then you can start reading from Fatsecret's public food and recipe database```pyfoods = fs.foods_search(&quot;Tacos&quot;)```Refer to the [documentation](https://pyfatsecret.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for further examples and detail## ContributingAll contributions are welcome! I'm not actively maintaining this library, so there's a good chance that any API changes have not been implemented in this wrapper.</longdescription>
