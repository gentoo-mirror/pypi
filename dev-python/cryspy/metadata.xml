	<longdescription>**CrysPy** is a crystallographic python library for polarized neutron diffraction data analysis.The package allows the data treatment both for powders and single-crystal samples. Nuclear and (commensurate) magnetic structures refinement can be also perfomed based on the unpolarized neutron diffraction and X-ray diffraction data.Features--------- CrysPy allows one to analyse the local magnetic anisotropy by the susceptibility approach  and the spin/magnetization densities reconstruction by maximume entropy procedure based on polarized neutron diffraction experiments;- Core CIF dictionary of the  IUCr is used to cover the requirements of archiving and exchanging the data and derived magnetic and structural results;- The library is written in Python. It can be used in Jupyter notebooks under the main platforms Windows, MacOSX and Linux or as a standalone application with a simple graphical user interface &quot;CrysPy Editor&quot;.For more information please visit the site `cryspy.fr &lt;https://www.cryspy.fr&gt;`_.Try `CrysPy in a Web Browser &lt;https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fmybinder.org%2Fv2%2Fgh%2Fikibalin%2Fcryspy_webapp%2FHEAD%3Furlpath%3Dvoila%252Frender%252Fcryspy_webapp.ipynb&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw3J-PERjuf-b-hp1OuoT4cK&gt;`_ before installing it on your PC.Copyright and License---------------------MIT LicenseCopyright (c) 2018-2020 Iurii Kibalinhttps://github.com/ikibalin/cryspyPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
