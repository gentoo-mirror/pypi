	<longdescription># Machine for PythonMachine is a natural language processing library. It is specifically focused on providing tools and techniques that are useful for processing languages that are very resource-poor. The library is also useful as a foundation for building more advanced language processing techniques. The library currently only provides a basic set of algorithms, but the goal is to include many more in the future.## InstallationMachine is available as a pip package:```pip install sil-machine```## TutorialsIf you would like to find out more about how to use Machine, check out the tutorial Jupyter notebooks:- [Tokenization](https://nbviewer.org/github/sillsdev/machine.py/blob/main/samples/tokenization.ipynb)- [Text Corpora](https://nbviewer.org/github/sillsdev/machine.py/blob/main/samples/corpora.ipynb)- [Word Alignment](https://nbviewer.org/github/sillsdev/machine.py/blob/main/samples/word_alignment.ipynb)</longdescription>
