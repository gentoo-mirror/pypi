It allows you to register your data and quickly generate informative and beautiful visualizations, either programmatically or via a dynamic GUI. Polyscope is designed to be lightweight---it does not &quot;take ownership&quot; over your entire program, and it is easy to integrate with existing codebases and popular libraries. The lofty objective of Polyscope is to offer a useful visual interface to your data via a single line of code.Polyscope uses a paradigm of *structures* and *quantities*. A **structure** is a geometric object in the scene, such as a surface mesh or point cloud. A **quantity** is data associated with a structure, such as a scalar function or a vector field.When any of these structures and quantities are registered, Polyscope displays them in an interactive 3D scene, handling boilerplate concerns such as toggling visibility, color-mapping data and adjusting maps, &quot;picking&quot; to click in the scene and query numerical quantities, etc.C++:``` C++#include &quot;polyscope/polyscope.h&quot;#include &quot;polyscope/surface_mesh.h&quot;// Initialize polyscopepolyscope::init();// Register a point cloud// `points` is a Nx3 array-like container of pointspolyscope::registerPointCloud(&quot;my points&quot;, points)// Register a surface mesh structure// `meshVerts` is a Vx3 array-like container of vertex positions// `meshFaces` is a Fx3 array-like container of face indices  polyscope::registerSurfaceMesh(&quot;my mesh&quot;, meshVerts, meshFaces);// Add a scalar and a vector function defined on the mesh// `scalarQuantity` is a length V array-like container of values// `vectorQuantity` is an Fx3 array-like container of vectors per facepolyscope::getSurfaceMesh(&quot;my mesh&quot;)-&gt;addVertexScalarQuantity(&quot;my_scalar&quot;, scalarQuantity);polyscope::getSurfaceMesh(&quot;my mesh&quot;)-&gt;addFaceVectorQuantity(&quot;my_vector&quot;, vectorQuantity);// View the point cloud and mesh we just registered in the 3D UIpolyscope::show();```Python:``` pythonimport polyscope as ps# Initialize polyscopeps.init()### Register a point cloud# `my_points` is a Nx3 numpy arrayps.register_point_cloud(&quot;my points&quot;, my_points)### Register a mesh# `verts` is a Nx3 numpy array of vertex positions# `faces` is a Fx3 array of indices, or a nested listps.register_surface_mesh(&quot;my mesh&quot;, verts, faces, smooth_shade=True)# Add a scalar function and a vector function defined on the mesh# vertex_scalar is a length V numpy array of values# face_vectors is an Fx3 array of vectors per faceps.get_surface_mesh(&quot;my mesh&quot;).add_scalar_quantity(&quot;my_scalar&quot;,         vertex_scalar, defined_on='vertices', cmap='blues')ps.get_surface_mesh(&quot;my mesh&quot;).add_vector_quantity(&quot;my_vector&quot;,         face_vectors, defined_on='faces', color=(0.2, 0.5, 0.5))# View the point cloud and mesh we just registered in the 3D UIps.show()```Polyscope is designed to make your life easier. It is simple to build, and fewer than 10 lines of code should be sufficient to start visualizing. In C++, some [template magic](https://polyscope.run/data_adaptors/) means Polyscope can probably accept the data types you're already using!---Author: [Nicholas Sharp](http://www.nmwsharp.com)If Polyscope contributes to an academic publication, cite it as:```bib@misc{polyscope,  title = {Polyscope},  author = {Nicholas Sharp and others},  note = {www.polyscope.run},  year = {2019}}```Development of this software was funded in part by NSF Award 1717320, an NSF graduate research fellowship, and gifts from Adobe Research and Autodesk, Inc.</longdescription>
