	<longdescription># mmiAmazon Linux default installation now starts with about ```175k+``` directories and files. How do we know which files belong on a particular host during the triage of the operating system?Review enough systems; you start remembering all those Amazon Linux operating system artifacts, just in time for new directories and filenames to end up in the mix or moved to other locations.The ```mmi``` command line tool lists the current pathâ€™s directories and files based on the user access, which are color-coded to help reduce triage time.![MatchMeta.Info CLI Output](MMI.png)### Installation```pip install matchmeta```### Command Line```mmi```### Color Coded- :purple_square: Empty File (purple)- :green_square: Known File (green)- :blue_square: Known Meta (blue)- :red_square: Large File (red)- :white_large_square: Partial Meta (grey)- :black_large_square: Unknown (black)- :yellow_square: Not Available (yellow)### GTFOBins- H for Known SHA256 Hash :red_square: (red)- P for Known Full Path :red_square: (red)- F for Known File Name :red_square: (red)https://gtfobins.github.io### Access Denied- *** for Access Denied :red_square: (red)### Local Development```pip install pybloomfiltermmap3 requestspython setup.py install --user```</longdescription>
