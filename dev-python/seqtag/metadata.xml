	<longdescription>https://pypi.org/project/seqtag/BiLSTM + CRF for sequence taggingThis is adapted from guillaumegenthial 's original implementation and is made configurable and easy to adapt and use.**Requirements:**This code is tested with all tensorflow versions from 1.3.0 to 1.10.0.tensorflow is not included in setup.py since, it will remove tensorflow-gpu.Separately install tensorflow by following https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ for this module to work.Download the 300 dimnesional glove vectors from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/**Installation:**The stable version can be installed by running &quot;pip install seqtag&quot;**How to Use:**Create a training directory with train.txt and valid.txt (test.txt is optional)set the config parameters as expected in a configuration file. An example of the configuration file can be found at https://github.com/bedapudi6788/seqtag/blob/master/example_config.json**Training:**from seqtag import trainertrainer.train(config_path = 'path_to_config_json')**Running Predictions:**from seqtag import predictormodel = predictor.load_model(path_to_config.json)predictor.predict(model, ['I', 'am', 'Batman'])['O', 'O', 'B-PER']For an usage example take a look at https://github.com/bedapudi6788/Deep-Segmentation/ . seqtag is used for sentence segmentation in this repo.</longdescription>
