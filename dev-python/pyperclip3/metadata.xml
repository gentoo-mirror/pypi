	<longdescription># This project Has Moved Please see https://pypi.org/project/pyclip/ # Pyperclip3Cross-platform clipboard utilities supporting both binary and text data.Some key features include:- A cross-platform API (supports MacOS, Windows, Linux)- Can handle arbitrary binary data- On Windows, some additional [clipboard formats](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dataxchg/standard-clipboard-formats) are supported## InstallationRequires python 3.7+```bashpip install pyperclip3```## Usagepyperclip3 can be used in Python code```pythonimport pyperclip3pyperclip3.copy(&quot;hello clipboard&quot;) # copy data to the clipboardcb_data = pyperclip3.paste() # retrieve clipboard contents print(cb_data)pyperclip3.clear() # clears the clipboard contentsassert not pyperclip3.paste()```Or a CLI```bash# paste clipboard contents to stdoutpython -m pyclip paste# load contents to the clipboard from stdinpython -m pyperclip3 copy &lt; myfile.text# same as above, but pipe from another commandsome-program | python -m pyperclip3 copy```Installing via pip also provides console script `pyclip`:```bashpyclip copy &lt; my_file.txt```This library implements functionality for several platforms and clipboard utilities. - [x] MacOS- [x] Windows- [x] Linux (with `xclip`)If there is a platform or utility not currently listed, please request it by creating an issue.## Platform specific notes/issues### Windows- On Windows, the `pywin32` package is installed as a requirement.- On Windows, additional clipboard formats are supported, including copying from a file (like if you right-click copy from File Explorer)### MacOSMacOS has support for multiple backends. By default, the `pasteboard` package is used.`pbcopy`/`pbpaste` can also be used as a backend, but does not support arbitrary binary data, which may lead to data being lost on copy/paste. This backend may be removed in a future release.### LinuxLinux requires `xclip` to work (which means you must also use X). Install with your package manager, e.g. `sudo apt install xclip`</longdescription>
