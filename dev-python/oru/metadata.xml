When setting up 2FA again, there will be option to say you do not have texting on your phone.

It should provide you with the MFA secret.The account id and meter number can be found on your Orange and Rockland Utility bill.Example usage::    from oru import Meter    meter = Meter(        email=&quot;myemail@email.com&quot;,        password=&quot;myorupassword&quot;,        mfa_type=&quot;TOTP&quot;,        mfa_secret=&quot;myorumfasecret&quot;,        account_id=&quot;cd754d65-5380-11e8-2307-2656615779bf&quot;,        meter_id=&quot;703437804&quot;)    value, unit_of_measurement = event_loop.run_until_complete(meter.last_read())</longdescription>
