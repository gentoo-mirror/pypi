	<longdescription>K5Test======*k5test* is a library for setting up self-contained Kerberos 5 environments,and running Python unit tests inside those environments.  It is based onthe file of the same name found alongside the MIT Kerberos 5 unit tests.Using k5test to set up a Kerberos 5 deployment----------------------------------------------*k5test* can be used to set up a self-contained MIT krb5 or Heimdalenvironment.  This is useful for testing applications without having tomanipulate existing Kerberos realms, or having to set up a full Kerberosdeployment by hand.To set up a realm, use the `k5test.K5Realm` class.  The constructor acceptsseveral useful arguments for controlling which parts get set up; refer to theinline documentation for more information.Using k5test to run unit tests------------------------------Instead of having test cases inherit from `unittest.TestCase`, inherit from`k5test.KerberosTestCase`, which will automatically set up a Kerberos 5environment, before the test case, and tear it down afterwards.Additionally, several decorators are defined.  the`k5test.gssapi_extension_test(extension_name, human_readable_name)` decorator(which requires `python-gssapi`) allows you to skip tests with installationsthat don't support a particular GSSAPI extension.  The the`k5test.krb_minversion_test(target_version, problem_name)` decorator allowsyou to skip tests when running a version of krb5 less that the requiredversion.  The `k5test.krb_plugin_test(plugin_type, plugin_name)` decoratorallows you to skip tests for installations that don't have a particular plugininstalled.</longdescription>
