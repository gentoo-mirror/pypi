	<longdescription>&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;50%&quot; src=&quot;docs/scispacy-logo.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;This repository contains custom pipes and models related to using spaCy for scientific documents.In particular, there is a custom tokenizer that adds tokenization rules on top of spaCy'srule-based tokenizer, a POS tagger and syntactic parser trained on biomedical data andan entity span detection model. Separately, there are also NER models for more specific tasks.**Just looking to test out the models on your data? Check out our [demo](https://scispacy.apps.allenai.org)**.## InstallationInstalling scispacy requires two steps: installing the library and intalling the models. To install the library, run:```bashpip install scispacy```to install a model (see our full selection of available models below), run a command like the following:```bashpip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.1/en_core_sci_sm-0.5.1.tar.gz```Note: We strongly recommend that you use an isolated Python environment (such as virtualenv or conda) to install scispacy.Take a look below in the &quot;Setting up a virtual environment&quot; section if you need some help with this.Additionally, scispacy uses modern features of Python and as such is only available for **Python 3.6 or greater**.#### Setting up a virtual environment[Conda](https://conda.io/) can be used set up a virtual environment with theversion of Python required for scispaCy.  If you already have a Python 3.6 or 3.7environment you want to use, you can skip to the 'installing via pip' section.1.  [Follow the installation instructions for Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html?highlight=conda#regular-installation).2.  Create a Conda environment called &quot;scispacy&quot; with Python 3.6:    ```bash    conda create -n scispacy python=3.6    ```3.  Activate the Conda environment. You will need to activate the Conda environment in each terminal in which you want to use scispaCy.    ```bash    source activate scispacy    ```Now you can install `scispacy` and one of the models using the steps above.Once you have completed the above steps and downloaded one of the models below, you can load a scispaCy model as you would any other spaCy model. For example:```pythonimport spacynlp = spacy.load(&quot;en_core_sci_sm&quot;)doc = nlp(&quot;Alterations in the hypocretin receptor 2 and preprohypocretin genes produce narcolepsy in some animals.&quot;)```#### Note on upgradingIf you are upgrading `scispacy`, you will need to download the models again, to get the model versions compatible with the version of `scispacy` that you have. The link to the model that you download should contain the version number of `scispacy` that you have.## Available ModelsTo install a model, click on the link below to download the model, and then run ```pythonpip install &lt;/path/to/download&gt;```Alternatively, you can install directly from the URL by right-clicking on the link, selecting &quot;Copy Link Address&quot; and running ```pythonpip install CMD-V(to paste the copied URL)```| Model          | Description       | Install URL|:---------------|:------------------|:----------|| en_core_sci_sm | A full spaCy pipeline for biomedical data with a ~100k vocabulary. |[Download](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.1/en_core_sci_sm-0.5.1.tar.gz)|| en_core_sci_md |  A full spaCy pipeline for biomedical data with a ~360k vocabulary and 50k word vectors. |[Download](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.1/en_core_sci_md-0.5.1.tar.gz)|| en_core_sci_lg |  A full spaCy pipeline for biomedical data with a ~785k vocabulary and 600k word vectors. |[Download](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.1/en_core_sci_lg-0.5.1.tar.gz)|| en_core_sci_scibert |  A full spaCy pipeline for biomedical data with a ~785k vocabulary and `allenai/scibert-base` as the transformer model.

The linker simply performsa string overlap - based search (char-3grams) on named entities, comparing them with the concepts in a knowledge baseusing an approximate nearest neighbours search.Currently (v2.5.0), there are 5 supported linkers:- `umls`: Links to the [Unified Medical Language System](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html), levels 0,1,2 and 9. This has ~3M concepts.- `mesh`: Links to the [Medical Subject Headings](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html). This contains a smaller set of higher quality entities, which are used for indexing in Pubmed. MeSH contains ~30k entities. NOTE: The MeSH KB is derived directly from MeSH itself, and as such uses different unique identifiers than the other KBs.- `rxnorm`: Links to the [RxNorm](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/index.html) ontology. RxNorm contains ~100k concepts focused on normalized names for clinical drugs. It is comprised of several other drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction, including First Databank, Micromedex, and the Gold Standard Drug Database.- `go`: Links to the [Gene Ontology](http://geneontology.org/). The Gene Ontology contains ~67k concepts focused on the functions of genes.- `hpo`: Links to the [Human Phenotype Ontology](https://hpo.jax.org/app/). The Human Phenotype Ontology contains 16k concepts focused on phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human disease.You may want to play around with some of the parametersbelow to adapt to your use case (higher precision, higher recall etc).- `resolve_abbreviations : bool = True, optional (default = False)`    Whether to resolve abbreviations identified in the Doc before performing linking.    This parameter has no effect if there is no `AbbreviationDetector` in the spacy    pipeline.- `k : int, optional, (default = 30)`    The number of nearest neighbours to look up from the candidate generator per mention.- `threshold : float, optional, (default = 0.7)`    The threshold that a mention candidate must reach to be added to the mention in the Doc    as a mention candidate.-   `no_definition_threshold : float, optional, (default = 0.95)`        The threshold that a entity candidate must reach to be added to the mention in the Doc        as a mention candidate if the entity candidate does not have a definition.- `filter_for_definitions: bool, default = True`    Whether to filter entities that can be returned to only include those with definitions    in the knowledge base.- `max_entities_per_mention : int, optional, default = 5`    The maximum number of entities which will be returned for a given mention, regardless of    how many are nearest neighbours are found.This class sets the `._.kb_ents` attribute on spacy Spans, which consists of aList[Tuple[str, float]] corresponding to the KB concept_id and the associated scorefor a list of `max_entities_per_mention` number of entities.You can look up more information for a given id using the kb attribute of this class:```print(linker.kb.cui_to_entity[concept_id])```#### Example Usage```pythonimport spacyimport scispacyfrom scispacy.linking import EntityLinkernlp = spacy.load(&quot;en_core_sci_sm&quot;)# This line takes a while, because we have to download ~1GB of data# and load a large JSON file (the knowledge base). Be patient!# Thankfully it should be faster after the first time you use it, because# the downloads are cached.# NOTE: The resolve_abbreviations parameter is optional, and requires that# the AbbreviationDetector pipe has already been added to the pipeline. Adding# the AbbreviationDetector pipe and setting resolve_abbreviations to True means# that linking will only be performed on the long form of abbreviations.nlp.add_pipe(&quot;scispacy_linker&quot;, config={&quot;resolve_abbreviations&quot;: True, &quot;linker_name&quot;: &quot;umls&quot;})doc = nlp(&quot;Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an \           inherited motor neuron disease caused by the expansion \           of a polyglutamine tract within the androgen receptor (AR). \           SBMA can be caused by this easily.&quot;)# Let's look at a random entity!entity = doc.ents[1]print(&quot;Name: &quot;, entity)&gt;&gt;&gt; Name: bulbar muscular atrophy# Each entity is linked to UMLS with a score# (currently just char-3gram matching).linker = nlp.get_pipe(&quot;scispacy_linker&quot;)for umls_ent in entity._.kb_ents:print(linker.kb.cui_to_entity[umls_ent[0]])&gt;&gt;&gt; CUI: C1839259, Name: Bulbo-Spinal Atrophy, X-Linked&gt;&gt;&gt; Definition: An X-linked recessive form of spinal muscular atrophy.

The tuples contain:- The relation rule used to extract the hyponym (type: `str`)- The more general concept  (type: `spacy.Span`)- The more specific concept (type: `spacy.Span`)#### Usage:```pythonimport spacyfrom scispacy.hyponym_detector import HyponymDetectornlp = spacy.load(&quot;en_core_sci_sm&quot;)nlp.add_pipe(&quot;hyponym_detector&quot;, last=True, config={&quot;extended&quot;: False})doc = nlp(&quot;Keystone plant species such as fig trees are good for the soil.&quot;)print(doc._.hearst_patterns)&gt;&gt;&gt; [('such_as', Keystone plant species, fig trees)]```## CitingIf you use ScispaCy in your research, please cite [ScispaCy: Fast and Robust Models for Biomedical Natural Language Processing](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ScispaCy%3A-Fast-and-Robust-Models-for-Biomedical-Neumann-King/de28ec1d7bd38c8fc4e8ac59b6133800818b4e29).
