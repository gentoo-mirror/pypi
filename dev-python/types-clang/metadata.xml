	<longdescription>###########types-clang###########==========================================Type Information for Clang Python Bindings==========================================Have you used the `Clang Python Bindings &lt;https://pypi.org/project/clang/&gt;`_, but wanted type hints in your IDE?Have you ever wanted to use `mypy &lt;http://mypy-lang.org/&gt;`_ tools on a project that uses Clang but gotten errors due tolack of type annotations?This package is a `PEP 561 &lt;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561&gt;`_ stub package which provides type information forClang.In other words, transform your IDE from:.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgockel/types-clang/trunk/doc/before.pngto:.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgockel/types-clang/trunk/doc/after.pngTo utilize this, add it globally with::    pip3 install types-clangOr add ``types-clang`` to ``dev-requirements.txt`` or ``pyproject.toml`` or whatever you use for dependency management.Versioning==========.. note::    This project is still ``0.x``, so add a ``0.`` in front of the descriptions here.    In other words, for ``clang`` ``12.0.1``, use ``types-clang`` ``0.12.2``.The published ``types-clang`` packages correspond with the type information of the ``{major}.{minor}`` of the ``clang``package.The patch version of ``types-clang`` does not correspond with any patch version of ``clang``, as they use semanticversioning correctly and will not add functionality in a patch release.So, if you install ``clang==13.0.1``, then ``types-clang&gt;=13.0, &lt;13.1`` will have the appropriate stubs.Best practice is to write the version specification for ``types-clang`` to be the same as the ``clang`` package, butwithout the patch.For `Poetry &lt;https://python-poetry.org/&gt;`_::    [tool.poetry.dependencies]    clang = &quot;14.0&quot;    [tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]    types-clang = &quot;14.0&quot;</longdescription>
