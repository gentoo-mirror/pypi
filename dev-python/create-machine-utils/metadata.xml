	<longdescription>Previously MiniUtils### WHAT'S NEW IN THIS VERSION?Fix the small bug with menus## Welcome to the create-machine-utils moduleHere at ClicksMinutePer we make discord bots. We do it so often infact that we often get a little annoyed at stuff that discord.py does badly, such as creating embeds&lt;br/&gt;We also don't like some stuff in python, such as the builtin json module, inputting values that aren't strings etc.&lt;br/&gt;create-machine-utils is the solution, at least for us: we've made it simpler (for us) to do stuff that needs doing (by us).We think it's better but honestly: you might just prefer normal python; that's ok too!Whatever way you decide, we hope you enjoy using ~~miniutils~~ &lt;sup&gt;You can't call it that anymore minion: someone over here already has that package name&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Oh, my bad... sorry.&lt;/sub&gt; create machine utils### FULL CHANGELOG#### Create-machine-utils 1.4.9:Fix the small bug with menus#### Create-machine-utils 1.4.8:Definitely not changing the version number each time to avoid writing new changelog entriesFixed... maybe?Change the menu so that you can put keyword arguments when calling itKeeping the previous changelog below as it's still relevant to such a minor change only a few hours after release:Large changelist this time, here we go:Rewrote the menu class (the old one is still available under the same name (but deprecated. It will likely be removed in the next major release), the new one is now available under Menus)Added a &quot;not&quot; check, which will be True when a check fails.Next release is likely to be a documentation release- we'll see how well that goes... (it wasn't)#### Create-machine-utils 1.4:Large changelist this time, here we go:Rewrote the menu class (the old one is still available under the same name (but deprecated. It will likely be removed in the next major release), the new one is now available under Menus)Added a &quot;not&quot; check, which will be True when a check fails.Next release is likely to be a documentation release- we'll see how well that goes...#### Create-machine-utils 1.3.11:And then remember that you actually need to make it check the negative (I'm really good at programming- please)#### Create-machine-utils 1.3.9b and 1.3.10:And once again enable recognising more errors#### Create-machine-utils 1.3.9:Fix that small bug with recognising more errors#### Create-machine-utils 1.3.8:Allow more types of errors to be recognised, that was really annoying for CancelledErrors#### Create-machine-utils 1.3.7:Allow ignoring the 'that exception isn't an exception' exception.
