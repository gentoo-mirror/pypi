This is a demonstration of [the Molter framework](https://github.com/Astrea49/molter-core), a framework for adding prefixed commands into Discord Python libraries.This attempts to make the prefixed command experience much like `discord.py`'s prefixed commands, though it is *not* 1:1 on purpose.**NOTE**: This extension is primarily developed by [Astrea49](https://github.com/Astrea49).## Installation```pip install interactions-molter```## DocumentationDocumentation, including examples and an API reference, for the `main` branch (and so the latest PyPI version) can be found at [its respective Github Page](https://interactions-py.github.io/molter/main/).For documentation for the other branches, you can look for the respective documentation [on the home page](https://interactions-py.github.io/molter/).## Branch Explanation- The `main` branch is the PyPI version - this branch will never deviate from it. This is done to make sure the PyPI page's example links link to the right code.- The `beta` branch is code considered code that is stable enough to use in daily use, though it is not perfect. This branch also will target any beta, pre-release, or release candidate version of `interactions.py`, if possible.- The `dev` branch mirrors `interactions.py`'s `unstable` branch, and is also a general testing ground for new and experimental changes. *Bugs are common on this branch. If you decide to use this branch, I highly suggest pinning to a specific commit you know is stable.*- The `gh-pages` branch powers the documentation website, and has no Molter-related code in it.## CreditThanks to both [`NAFF`](https://github.com/NAFTeam/NAFF) and [Toricane's `interactions-message-commands`](https://github.com/Toricane/interactions-message-commands) for a decent part of this! They both had a huge influence over how this port was designed.</longdescription>
