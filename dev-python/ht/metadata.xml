It includes modulesfor various heat transfer functions.Among the tasks this library can be used for are:* Sizing a Shell &amp; Tube heat exchanger using any of the Zukauskas, ESDU 73031, or Bell methods* Calculating pressure drop in a Hairpin heat exchanger* Calculating heat loss of objects, including insulated objects* Calculating heat loss from buried pipe* Performing radiative heat transfer calculations* Conderser and Reboiler rating* Detailed heat exchanger evaluation; finding fouling factors* Heat transfer in packed beds* Sizing a Plate and Frame heat exchanger* Modeling an Air Cooler* Supercritical CO2 or water heat transferThe ht library depends on the SciPy library to provide numerical constants,interpolation, integration, and numerical solving functionality. ht runs onall operating systems which support Python, is quick to install, and is freeof charge. ht is designed to be easy to use while still providing powerfulfunctionality. If you need to perform some heat transfer calculations, giveht a try.Installation------------Get the latest version of ht fromhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/ht/If you have an installation of Python with pip, simple install it with:    $ pip install htAlternatively, if you are using `conda &lt;https://conda.io/en/latest/&gt;`_ as your package management, you can simplyinstall ht in your environment from `conda-forge &lt;https://conda-forge.org/&gt;`_ channel with:    $ conda install -c conda-forge htTo get the git version, run:    $ git clone git://github.com/CalebBell/ht.gitDocumentation-------------ht's documentation is available on the web:    https://ht.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.htmlLatest source code------------------The latest development version of ht's sources can be obtained at    https://github.com/CalebBell/htBug reports-----------To report bugs, please use the ht's Bug Tracker at:    https://github.com/CalebBell/ht/issuesLicense information-------------------ht is MIT licensed.
