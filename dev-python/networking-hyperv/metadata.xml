Change things from this point on=================networking-hyperv=================This project tracks the work to integrate the Hyper-V networking with Neutron.This project contains the Hyper-V Neutron Agent, Security Groups Driver, andML2 Mechanism Driver, which are used to properly bind neutron ports on aHyper-V host.This project resulted from the neutron core vendor decomposition.Supports Python 2.7, Python 3.3, Python 3.4, and Python 3.5.* Free software: Apache license* Documentation: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/networking-hyperv* Source: https://opendev.org/openstack/networking-hyperv* Bugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/networking-hyperv* Release notes: https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/networking-hyperv/index.htmlHow to Install--------------Run the following command to install the agent on the system:::    C:\networking-hyperv&gt; python setup.py installTo use the ``neutron-hyperv-agent``, the Neutron Controller will have to beproperly configured. For this, the config option ``core_plugin`` in the``/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`` file must be set as follows:::    core_plugin = neutron.plugins.ml2.plugin.Ml2PluginAdditionally, ``hyperv`` will have to be added as a mechanism driver in the``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini`` configuration file:::    mechanism_drivers = openvswitch,hypervIn order for these changes to take effect, the ``neutron-server`` service willhave to be restarted.Finally, make sure the ``tenant_network_types`` field contains network typessupported by Hyper-V: local, flat, vlan, gre.Tests-----You will have to install the test dependencies first to be able to run thetests.::    C:\networking-hyperv&gt; pip install -r requirements.txt    C:\networking-hyperv&gt; pip install -r test-requirements.txtYou can run the unit tests with the following command.::    C:\networking-hyperv&gt; nosetests networking_hyperv\testsHow to contribute-----------------To contribute to this project, please go through the following steps.1. Clone the project and keep your working tree updated.2. Make modifications on your working tree.3. Run unit tests.4. If the tests pass, commit your code.5. Submit your code via ``git review -v``.6. Check that Jenkins and the Microsoft Hyper-V CI pass on your patch.7. If there are issues with your commit, amend, and submit it again via   ``git review -v``.8. Wait for the patch to be reviewed.Features--------* Supports Flat, VLAN, GRE / NVGRE network types.* Supports Neutron Security Groups.* Contains ML2 Mechanism Driver.* Parallel port processing.</longdescription>
