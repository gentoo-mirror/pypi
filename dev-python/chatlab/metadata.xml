	<longdescription># ChatLab**Chat Experiments, Simplified**üí¨üî¨ChatLab is a Python package that makes it easy to experiment with OpenAI's chat models. It provides a simple interface for chatting with the models and a way to register functions that can be called from the chat model.Best yet, it's interactive in the notebook!‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: The following docs are for `main`. Check out [chatlab.dev](https://chatlab.dev) for the docs for the most recent release. ## Introduction```pythonimport chatlabimport randomdef flip_a_coin():    '''Returns heads or tails'''    return random.choice(['heads', 'tails'])chat = chatlab.Chat()chat.register(flip_a_coin)await chat(&quot;Please flip a coin for me&quot;)```&lt;details style=&quot;background:#DDE6ED;color:#27374D;padding:.5rem 1rem;borderRadius:5px&quot;&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&amp;nbsp;ùëì&amp;nbsp; Ran `flip_a_coin`&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Input:```json{}```Output:```json&quot;tails&quot;```&lt;/details&gt;```markdownIt landed on tails!```In the notebook, text will stream into a Markdown output and function inputs and outputs are a nice collapsible display, like with ChatGPT Plugins.TODO: Include GIF/mp4 of this in action### Installation```bashpip install chatlab```### ConfigurationYou'll need to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can find your API key on your [OpenAI account page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). I recommend setting it in an `.env` file when working locally.On hosted environments like Noteable, set it in your Secrets to keep it safe from prying LLM eyes.## What can `Chat`s enable _you_ to do?üí¨Where `Chat`s take it next level is with _Chat Functions_. You can-   declare a function-   register the function in your `Chat`-   watch as Chat Models call your functions!You may recall this kind of behavior from [ChatGPT Plugins](https://noteable.io/chatgpt-plugin-for-notebook/). Now, you can take this even further with your own custom code.As an example, let's give the large language models the ability to tell time.```pythonfrom datetime import datetimefrom pytz import timezone, all_timezones, utcfrom typing import Optionalfrom pydantic import BaseModeldef what_time(tz: Optional[str] = None):    '''Current time, defaulting to UTC'''    if tz is None:        pass    elif tz in all_timezones:        tz = timezone(tz)    else:        return 'Invalid timezone'    return datetime.now(tz).strftime('%I:%M %p')class WhatTime(BaseModel):    tz: Optional[str] = None```Let's break this down.`what_time` is the function we're going to provide access to. Its docstring forms the `description` for the model while the schema comes from the pydantic `BaseModel` called `WhatTime`.```pythonimport chatlabchat = chatlab.Chat()# Register our functionchat.register(what_time, WhatTime)```After that, we can call `chat` with direct strings (which are turned into user messages) or using simple message makers from `chatlab` named `user` and `system`.```pythonawait chat(&quot;What time is it?&quot;)```&lt;details style=&quot;background:#DDE6ED;color:#27374D;padding:.5rem 1rem;borderRadius:5px&quot;&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&amp;nbsp;ùëì&amp;nbsp; Ran `what_time`&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Input:```json{}```Output:```json&quot;11:19 AM&quot;```&lt;/details&gt;```markdownThe current time is 11:19 AM.```## InterfaceThe `chatlab` package exports### `Chat`The `Chat` class is the main way to chat using OpenAI's models. It keeps a history of your chat in `Chat.messages`.#### `Chat.submit``submit` is how you send all the currently built up messages over to OpenAI. Markdown output will display responses from the `assistant`.```pythonawait chat.submit('What would a parent who says &quot;I have to play zone defense&quot; mean? ')# Markdown response inlinechat.messages``````js[{'role': 'user',  'content': 'What does a parent of three kids mean by &quot;I have to play zone defense&quot;?'}, {'role': 'assistant',  'content': 'When a parent of three kids says &quot;I have to play zone defense,&quot; it means that they...```#### `Chat.register`You can register functions with `Chat.register` to make them available to the chat model. The function's docstring becomes the description of the function while the schema is derived from the `pydantic.BaseModel` passed in.```pythonfrom pydantic import BaseModelclass WhatTime(BaseModel):    tz: Optional[str] = Nonedef what_time(tz: Optional[str] = None):    '''Current time, defaulting to UTC'''    if tz is None:        pass    elif tz in all_timezones:        tz = timezone(tz)    else:        return 'Invalid timezone'    return datetime.now(tz).strftime('%I:%M %p')chat.register(what_time, WhatTime)```#### `Chat.messages`The raw messages sent and received to OpenAI. If you hit a token limit, you can remove old messages from the list to make room for more.```pythonchat.messages = chat.messages[-100:]```### Messaging#### `human`/`user`These functions create a message from the user to the chat model.```pythonfrom chatlab import humanhuman(&quot;How are you?&quot;)``````json{ &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;How are you?&quot; }```#### `narrate`/`system``system` messages, also called `narrate` in `chatlab`, allow you to steer the model in a direction. You can use these to provide context without being seen by the user. One common use is to include it as initial context for the conversation.```pythonfrom chatlab import narratenarrate(&quot;You are a large bird&quot;)``````json{ &quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;You are a large bird&quot; }```## DevelopmentThis project uses poetry for dependency management. To get started, clone the repo and run```bashpoetry install -E dev -E test```We use `ruff` and `mypy`.## ContributingPull requests are welcome.
