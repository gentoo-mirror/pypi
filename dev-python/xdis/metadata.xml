	<longdescription>|PyPI Installs| |Latest Version| |Supported Python Versions||packagestatus|xdis====A Cross-Python bytecode disassembler, bytecode/wordcode and magic-number manipulation library/package.Introduction------------The Python dis_ module allows you to disassemble bytecode from the sameversion of Python that you are running on. But what about bytecode fromdifferent versions?That's what this package is for. It can &quot;marshal load&quot; Pythonbytecodes from different versions of Python. The command-line routine*pydisasm* will show disassembly output using the most modern Pythondisassembly conventions.Also, if you need to modify and write bytecode, the routines here canbe of help. There are routines to pack and unpack the read-only tuplesin Python's Code type. For interoperability between Python 2 and 3 weprovide our own versions of the Code type, and we provide routines toreduce the tedium in writing a bytecode file.This package also has an extensive knowledge of Python bytecode magicnumbers, including Pypy and others, and how to translate from`sys.sys_info` major, minor, and release numbers to the correspondingmagic value.So If you want to write a cross-version assembler, or abytecode-level optimizer this package may also be useful. In additionto the kinds of instruction categorization that `dis`` offers, we haveadditional categories for things that would be useful in such abytecode optimizer.The programs here accept bytecodes from Python version 1.0 to 3.10 orso. The code requires Python 2.4 or later and has been tested onPython running lots of Python versions.When installing, except for the most recent versions of Python, usethe Python egg or wheel that matches that version, e.g. ``xdis-6.0.2-py3.3.egg``, ``xdis-6.0.2-py33-none-any.whl``.Of course for versions that pre-date wheel's, like Python 2.6, you will have to use eggs.To install older versions for from source in git use the branch``python-2.4-to-2.7`` for Python versions from 2.4 to 2.7,``python-3.1-to-3.2`` for Python versions from 3.1 to 3.2,``python-3.3-to-3.5`` for Python versions from 3.3 to 3.5. The masterbranch handles Python 3.6 and later.Installation------------The standard Python routine:::    $ pip install -e .    $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txtA GNU makefile is also provided so ``make install`` (possibly as root orsudo) will do the steps above.Testing-------::   $ make checkA GNU makefile has been added to smooth over setting running the rightcommand, and running tests from fastest to slowest.If you have remake_ installed, you can see the list of all tasksincluding tests via ``remake --tasks``.Usage-----Run::     $ ./bin/pydisasm -hfor usage help.As a drop-in replacement for dis~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`xdis` also provides some support as a drop in replacement for thethe Python library `dis &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html&gt;`_module. This is may be desirable when you want to use the improved APIfrom Python 3.4 or later from an earlier Python version.For example:&gt;&gt;&gt; # works in Python 2 and 3&gt;&gt;&gt; import xdis.std as dis&gt;&gt;&gt; [x.opname for x in dis.Bytecode('a = 10')]['LOAD_CONST', 'STORE_NAME', 'LOAD_CONST', 'RETURN_VALUE']There may some small differences in output produced for formatteddisassembly or how we show compiler flags. We expect you'llfind the ``xdis`` output more informative though.See Also--------* https://pypi.org/project/uncompyle6/ : Python Bytecode Deparsing* https://pypi.org/project/decompyle3/ : Python Bytecode Deparsing for Python 3.7 and 3.8* https://pypi.org/project/xasm/ : Python Bytecode Assembler* https://pypi.org/project/x-python/ : Python Bytecode Interpreter written in Python.. _trepan: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/trepan.. _debuggers: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/trepan3k.. _remake: http://bashdb.sf.net/remake.. |Supported Python Versions| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/xdis.svg.. |Latest Version| image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/xdis.svg  :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/xdis.. |PyPI Installs| image:: https://pepy.tech/badge/xdis/month.. |packagestatus| image:: https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/python:xdis.svg :target: https://repology.org/project/python:xdis/versions.. _dis: https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html</longdescription>
