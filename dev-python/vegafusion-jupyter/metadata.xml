	<longdescription># VegaFusion JupyterThis directory contains the `vegafusion-jupyter` package. For documentation on using this package to display Altair visualizations powered by VegaFusion in Jupyter contexts, see https://vegafusion.io.The content below was autogenerated by Jupyter Widget cookiecutter---# vegafusion-jupyter[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonmmease/vegafusion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonmmease/vegafusion_jupyter)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/jonmmease/vegafusion/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/jonmmease/vegafusion)Altair Jupyter Widget library that relies on VegaFusion for serverside calculations## InstallationYou can install using `pip`:```bashpip install vegafusion_jupyter```If you are using Jupyter Notebook 5.2 or earlier, you may also need to enablethe nbextension:```bashjupyter nbextension enable --py [--sys-prefix|--user|--system] vegafusion_jupyter```## Development InstallationCreate a dev environment:```bashconda create -n vegafusion_jupyter-dev -c conda-forge nodejs yarn python jupyterlabconda activate vegafusion_jupyter-dev```Install the python. This will also build the TS package.```bashpip install -e &quot;.[test, examples]&quot;```When developing your extensions, you need to manually enable your extensions with thenotebook / lab frontend. For lab, this is done by the command:```jupyter labextension develop --overwrite .yarn run build```For classic notebook, you need to run:```jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --symlink --overwrite --py vegafusion_jupyterjupyter nbextension enable --sys-prefix --py vegafusion_jupyter```Note that the `--symlink` flag doesn't work on Windows, so you will here have to runthe `install` command every time that you rebuild your extension. For certain installationsyou might also need another flag instead of `--sys-prefix`, but we won't cover the meaningof those flags here.### How to see your changes#### Typescript:If you use JupyterLab to develop then you can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in differentterminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the widget.```bash# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when neededyarn run watch# Run JupyterLab in another terminaljupyter lab```After a change wait for the build to finish and then refresh your browser and the changes should take effect.#### Python:If you make a change to the python code then you will need to restart the notebook kernel to have it take effect.</longdescription>
