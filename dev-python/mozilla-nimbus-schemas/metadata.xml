A deployment is triggered on merges into the `main` branch when the version number changes. Schemas are published to various repos for access in different languages.#### Versioning`mozilla-nimbus-schemas` uses a date-based versioning scheme (`CalVer`). The format is `yyyy.m.MINOR`, where `m` is the non-zero-padded month, and `MINOR` is an incrementing number starting from 1 for each month. Notably, this `MINOR` number does NOT correspond to the day of the month. For example, the second release in June of 2023 would have a version of `2023.6.2`.#### Version Updates1. To update the published package versions, update the `VERSION` file in this directory.  - From the project root, you can run the helper script:    - `./scripts/set_schemas_version.sh &lt;version&gt;`  - Or write to the file:    - `echo &lt;version&gt; &gt; ./schemas/VERSION`  - Or simply edit the file in any text editor.2.
