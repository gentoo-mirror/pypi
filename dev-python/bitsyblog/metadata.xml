	<longdescription>bitsyblog=========*bitsyblog doesn't do much, but it could do less*Why another blog?-----------------My ideal blog would invoke my favorite editor, take a bunch of text, and throw it on the web.  Sometimes I like to write long elaborate posts.Othertimes I just want to make a quick note.Meet `bitsyblog &lt;http://bitsyblog.biz&gt;`_, a tiny tiny `python &lt;http://python.org/&gt;`_`weblog &lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitsyblog/&gt;`_.  Posting is done with a POST request, so while you can usea web form to do this, its just as easy to use curl, urllib, or anything else to post.How does it work?-----------------A user URLs is likehttp://bitsyblog.biz/k0sk0s is my user name here .  If you are 1337h4x0r, this will be http://bitsyblog.biz/1337h4x0r .Posting to this will take the body of the POST request and add a date stampBlog entries are thrown in files and are displayed with markup available with `restructured text &lt;http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html&gt;`_.You can also get a more specific range of posts by specifying up to the year, monthand day in the URL:http://bitsyblog.biz/k0s/2008/2/1Not all of this needs to be specified.Permalinks are also available in the form of the date stamp:http://bitsyblog.biz/k0s/20080201141502You can find the permalink by clicking on the subject of the blog post.If you really want to post through the web, support is at http://bitsyblog.biz/k0s/postIf you're more friendly with python scripts, `blogme.py &lt;https://svn.openplans.org/svn/standalone/bitsyblog/trunk/blogme.py&gt;`_is available: https://svn.openplans.org/svn/standalone/bitsyblog/trunk/blogme.pyGet me a blog!--------------Create an account at http://bitsyblog.biz/join .  All you need is ausername and password (and I threw a `CAPTCHA &lt;http://skimpygimpy.sourceforge.net/&gt;`_ in there at somepoint).Then...you're ready to blog!  The auth is a minimal thingI threw together out of `paste.auth &lt;http://pythonpaste.org/&gt;`_.Once you're signed in, you'll notice the navigation links at the topof the page have changed.  You can now post and change your preferences.In your preferences, you can change the date format and set thesubject format of your blog posts.  You can also upload verifiable CSS to theme your blog.  For the date format, I have patched`dateutil.parser &lt;http://labix.org/python-dateutil&gt;`_to return the format string that the date was originally in and hopethat my changes can make it back to the source sometime.When posting, you have the option to make your post 'public' (everyonecan see it), 'secret' (only your friends can see it), 'private' (onlyyou can see it.  Friends are settable in your preferences.What bitsyblog doesn't do-------------------------* Commenting:  this should done with `WSGI middlware&lt;http://groovie.org/articles/2005/10/06/wsgi-and-wsgi-middleware-is-easy&gt;`_.  There's nothing specific about commenting on a blog post that is anydifferent from commenting on a paragraph in (for instance) a wiki article.* Tagging:  again, this should be done with middleware* Hosting files:  Its a blog, not a file repo!  Any markup doable with `restructured text &lt;http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html&gt;`_is doable with bitsyblog, but images, videos, whatever mustbe held off-site.What is next for bitsyblog?---------------------------Other than that, its a pretty small project.  No templates andcurrently about 700 lines of code. (I'll get it back to 500, Iswear). bitsyblog is designed as a personal blog that should be strongin both workflow as well as &quot;niceness&quot; of code.I'm guessing your blog doesn't do much...but could it do less?bitsyblog is built on top of `paste &lt;http://pythonpaste.org/&gt;`_and `webob &lt;http://pythonpaste.org/webob/&gt;`_.  You'll need the trunk version of paste for a change made to `paste.auth.auth_tkt&lt;http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/trunk/paste/auth/auth_tkt.py&gt;`_ in order to have cookies work correctly (r7261).Thanks to `The Open Planning Project &lt;http://www.openplans.org&gt;`_ and my friends there for making this possible.Please email jhammel at openplans dot org with any questions.</longdescription>
