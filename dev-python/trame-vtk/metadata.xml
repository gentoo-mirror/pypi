In the example below we used `namespace=&quot;view&quot;`... list-table::   :widths: 25 75   :header-rows: 1   * - Variable     - Description   * - viewId     - `str` representing the vtkRenderWindow id   * - viewMode     - `local`or `remote` to control which View is displayed to the userConstructing a VtkRemoteLocalView will also set several trame triggers... list-table::   :widths: 25 75   :header-rows: 1   * - Trigger     - Description   * - viewCamera     - When call with no arguments, the server will push its camera to the client   * - viewAnimateStart     - Start the animation loop for constantly rendering   * - viewAnimateStop     - Stop the animation loopThe `namespace` will also be used as `ref=` unless provided by the user.Mode parameter```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````The mode is driven by the variable `{namespace}Mode` but can be provided when instantiated so the default can be overridden and a JavaScript expression can be used instead of the default variable. This attribute behaves the same way as any trame one except, we won't register the left side as a state entry since we already have one under `{namespace}Mode`. This means we will evaluate the left side of the expression assuming a tuple is provided and the right side of the tuple is used to set its initial value.Examples```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````- `API &lt;https://trame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trame.html.vtk.html&gt;`_- `VTK/ContourGeometry/DynamicLocalRemoteRendering &lt;https://github.com/Kitware/trame/blob/f6594a02ed7e1ecc24058ffac527e010e8181e22/examples/VTK/ContourGeometry/DynamicLocalRemoteRendering.py&gt;`_</longdescription>
