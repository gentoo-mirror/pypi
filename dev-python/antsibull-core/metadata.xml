We might make exceptions from this in case of security fixes for vulnerabilities that are severe enough.The current major version is 2.x.y. Development for 2.x.y occurs on the `main` branch. 2.x.y mainly differs from 1.x.y by dropping support for Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8. It deprecates several compatibility functions for older Python versions that are no longer needed; see the changelog for details. 1.x.y is still developed on the `stable-1` branch, but only security fixes, major bugfixes, and other changes that are absolutely necessary for the other antsibull projects will be backported.## DevelopmentInstall and run `nox` to run all tests. That's it for simple contributions!`nox` will create virtual environments in `.nox` inside the checked out projectand install the requirements needed to run the tests there.To run specific tests:1. `nox -e test` to only run unit tests;2. `nox -e coverage` to display combined coverage results after running `nox -e   test`;3. `nox -e lint` to run all linters and formatters at once;4. `nox -e formatters` to run `isort` and `black`;3. `nox -e codeqa` to run `flake8`, `pylint`, `reuse lint`, and `antsibull-changelog lint`;6. `nox -e typing` to run `mypy` and `pyre`## Creating a new release:1. Run `nox -e bump -- &lt;version&gt; &lt;release_summary_message&gt;`. This:   * Bumps the package version in `pyproject.toml`.   * Creates `changelogs/fragments/&lt;version&gt;.yml` with a `release_summary` section.   * Runs `antsibull-changelog release` and adds the changed files to git.   * Commits with message `Release &lt;version&gt;.` and runs `git tag -a -m 'antsibull-core &lt;version&gt;' &lt;version&gt;`.   * Runs `hatch build`.2. Run `git push` to the appropriate remotes.3. Once CI passes on GitHub, run `nox -e publish`. This:   * Runs `hatch publish`;   * Bumps the version to `&lt;version&gt;.post0`;   * Adds the changed file to git and run `git commit -m 'Post-release version bump.'`;4. Run `git push --follow-tags` to the appropriate remotes and create a GitHub release.## LicenseUnless otherwise noted in the code, it is licensed under the terms of the GNUGeneral Public License v3 or, at your option, later.
