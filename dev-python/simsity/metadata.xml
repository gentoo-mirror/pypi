Literally! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This repository contains simple tools to help in similarity retrieval scenariosby making a convenient wrapper around [hnswlib](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib/blob/master/examples/python/EXAMPLES.md).Typical usecases include early stage bulk labelling and duplication discovery.## InstallYou can install simsity via pip.```python -m pip install simsity```The goal of simsity is to be minimal, to make rapid prototyping very easy and to be &quot;just enough&quot; for medium sized datasets. You will mainly interact with these two functions. ```pythonfrom simsity import create_index, load_index```As their names imply, you can use these to create an index or to load one from disk. ## Quickstart```pythonfrom simsity import create_index, load_index# Let's fetch some demo datafrom simsity.datasets import fetch_recipesdf_recipes = fetch_recipes()recipes = df_recipes[&quot;text&quot;]# Let's use embetter for embeddings from embetter.text import SentenceEncoderencoder = SentenceEncoder()# Populate the ANN vector index and use it. index = create_index(recipes, encoder)texts, dists = index.query(&quot;pork&quot;)# You can also query using vectorsv_pork = encoder.transform([&quot;pork&quot;])[0]texts, dists = index.query_vector(v_pork)```You can also provide a path and then you'll be able to store/load everything.```python# Make an index with a pathindex = create_index(recipes, encoder, path=&quot;demo&quot;)# Load an index from a pathreloaded_index = load_index(path=&quot;demo&quot;, encoder=encoder)texts, dists = reloaded_index.query(&quot;pork&quot;)```That's it! Happy hacking!</longdescription>
