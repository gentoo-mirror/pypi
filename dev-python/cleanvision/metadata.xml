Or just use any collection of image files you have.```shellwget -nc 'https://cleanlab-public.s3.amazonaws.com/CleanVision/image_files.zip'```1. Run CleanVision to audit the images.```pythonfrom cleanvision import Imagelab# Specify path to folder containing the image files in your datasetimagelab = Imagelab(data_path=&quot;FOLDER_WITH_IMAGES/&quot;)# Automatically check for a predefined list of issues within your datasetimagelab.find_issues()# Produce a neat report of the issues found in your datasetimagelab.report()```2. CleanVision diagnoses many types of issues, but you can also check for only specific issues.```pythonissue_types = {&quot;dark&quot;: {}, &quot;blurry&quot;: {}}imagelab.find_issues(issue_types=issue_types)# Produce a report with only the specified issue_typesimagelab.report(issue_types=issue_types)```## More resources on how to use CleanVision- [Tutorial](https://cleanvision.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorial.html)- [Run CleanVision on a HuggingFace dataset](https://cleanvision.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/huggingface_dataset.html)- [Run CleanVision on a Torchvision dataset](https://cleanvision.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/torchvision_dataset.html)- [Example script](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanvision/blob/main/docs/source/tutorials/run.py) that can be run with: `python examples/run.py --path &lt;FOLDER_WITH_IMAGES&gt;`- [Additional example notebooks](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanvision-examples)- [Documentation](https://cleanvision.readthedocs.io/)- [Blog Post](https://cleanlab.ai/blog/cleanvision/)## *Clean* your data for better Computer *Vision*The quality of machine learning models hinges on the quality of the data used to train them, but it is hard to manually identify all of the low-quality data in a big dataset. CleanVision helps you automatically identify common types of data issues lurking in image datasets.This package currently detects issues in the raw images themselves, making it a useful tool for any computer visiontask such as: classification, segmentation, object detection, pose estimation, keypoint detection, [generative modeling](https://openai.com/research/dall-e-2-pre-training-mitigations), etc.To detect issues in the labels of your image data, you can insteaduse the [cleanlab](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab/) package.In any collection of image files (most [formats](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html) supported), CleanVision can detect the following types of issues:|   | Issue Type       | Description                                                     | Issue Key        | Example                                                                                                                                 ||---|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| 1 | Exact Duplicates | Images that are identical to each other                         | exact_duplicates | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleanlab/assets/master/cleanvision/example_issue_images/exact_duplicates.png)                     || 2 | Near Duplicates  | Images that are visually almost identical                       | near_duplicates  | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleanlab/assets/master/cleanvision/example_issue_images/near_duplicates.png)                      || 3 | Blurry           | Images where details are fuzzy (out of focus)                   | blurry           | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleanlab/assets/master/cleanvision/example_issue_images/blurry.png)                               || 4 | Low Information  | Images lacking content (little entropy in pixel values)         | low_information  | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleanlab/assets/master/cleanvision/example_issue_images/low_information.png)                      || 5 | Dark             | Irregularly dark images (*under*exposed)                        | dark             | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleanlab/assets/master/cleanvision/example_issue_images/dark.jpg)                                 || 6 | Light            | Irregularly bright images (*over*exposed)                       | light            | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleanlab/assets/master/cleanvision/example_issue_images/light.jpg)                                || 7 | Grayscale        | Images lacking color                                            | grayscale        | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleanlab/assets/master/cleanvision/example_issue_images/grayscale.jpg)                            || 8 | Odd Aspect Ratio | Images with an unusual aspect ratio (overly skinny/wide)        | odd_aspect_ratio | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleanlab/assets/master/cleanvision/example_issue_images/odd_aspect_ratio.jpg)                     || 9 | Odd Size         | Images that are abnormally large or small | odd_size         | &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleanlab/assets/master/cleanvision/example_issue_images/odd_size.png&quot; width=20% height=20%&gt; |This package is still a work in progress, so expect sharp edges.Feel free to submit any found bugs or desired functionality as an [issue][issue]!CleanVision supports Linux, macOS, and Windows and runs on Python 3.7+.## Join our community* The best place to learn is [our Slack community](https://cleanlab.ai/slack).
