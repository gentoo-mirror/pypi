	<longdescription># AllStar&quot;allstar&quot; is a simple library for managing the the \_\_all\_\_ attribute in modules.The \_\_all\_\_ attribute is used to specify what is imported when using the `from module import *` syntax. This type of import is commonly used by project mapping tools like documentation generators. It is important to manage \_\_all\_\_ because, for example, you may not want to generate documentation for imported classes, only for the ones you have created.&gt; The library is named &quot;allstar&quot; because the \_\_all\_\_ attribute is imported using the star (*) symbol.# Installation```bashpip install allstar```# Usage## Basic usage```pythonfrom allstar import Star# manager instance# __name__ is used to reference the module and its attributesstar = Star(__name__)# star.sign adds a callable to the __all__ iterable@star.signclass TheClass:    pass@star.signdef the_function():    passprint(__all__)  # prints: ['TheClass', 'the_function']```## Extended usage```pythonimport os, sys, builtinsfrom allstar import Star__all__ = ['os']  # Star preserves the previous namesstar = Star(__name__)star.include('builtins')  # include names using strings or referencesstar.include_all(['os', 'sys'])  # include names using iterables```## Some extra features```pythonfrom allstar import Starstar = Star(__name__)star.empty()  # empties the __all__ iterablestar.freeze()  # turns the __all__ iterable into a tuple```# AuthorAlejandro CRcontacto@alejandrocr.cohttps://github.com/virtualitems/# Projecthttps://pypi.org/project/allstar/https://github.com/virtualitems/allstar# LicenseMIT LicenseCopyright (c) 2022 Virtual ItemsPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
