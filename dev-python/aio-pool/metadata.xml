	<longdescription># aio-poolExtending Python's `multiporcessing.Pool` to support coroutine functions.  Can be useful for when using a server with very high bandwidth or doing both very large IO and CPU tasks at the same time.   All methods of `multiprocessing.Pool` are supported.    All paramters for multiprocessing.Pool are supported.  ## examples:Setting concurrency limit. This means each process can run with up to 8 concurrent tasks at a time. ```pythonimport asynciofrom aio_pool import AioPoolasync def powlong(a):  await asyncio.sleep(1)  return a**2if __name__ == '__main__':  with AioPool(processes=2, concurrency_limit=8) as pool:    results = pool.map(powlong, [i for i in range(16)])  # Should take 2 seconds (2*8).    print(results) ```Async initliazers are also suppported.```pythonimport asynciofrom aio_pool import AioPoolasync def start(message):  await asyncio.sleep(1)  print(message)async def powlong(a):  await asyncio.sleep(1)  return a**2if __name__ == '__main__':  with AioPool(processes=2,                concurrency_limit=8,                initializer=start,               init_args=(&quot;Started with AioPool&quot;, )) as pool:    results = pool.map(powlong, [i for i in range(16)])  # Should take 2 seconds (2*8).    print(results)     ```By default, AioPool also set up a default executor for any non-async tasks.  The size can be determined by `threadpool_size` arguemnt, which defaults to 1.   None default event loops(`uvloop` for example) are supported as well, using the `loop_initializer` argument.  Also, non-async functions are supported by default, as the AioPool worker identify if the function is async or not.  If the function is not async, it runs inside the threadpool, to allow the requested concurrency.   This means that order of execution is not guaranteed, even if the function is not async.  However, the order of results is guaranteed through the pool API (map, starmap, apply, etc...).  ```pythonfrom aio_pool import AioPoolimport uvloopwith AioPool(loop_initializer=uvloop.new_event_loop, threadpool_size=4) pool:  pool.map(print, [i for i in range(8)])``` </longdescription>
