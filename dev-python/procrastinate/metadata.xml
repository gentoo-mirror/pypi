It can be used within both sync and async code.In other words, from your main code, you call specific functions (tasks) in aspecial way and instead of being run on the spot, they're scheduled tobe run elsewhere, now or in the future.Here's an example:.. code-block:: python    # mycode.py    import procrastinate    # Make an app in your code    app = procrastinate.App(connector=procrastinate.AiopgConnector())    # Then define tasks    @app.task(queue=&quot;sums&quot;)    def sum(a, b):        with open(&quot;myfile&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) as f:            f.write(str(a + b))    with app.open():        # Launch a job        sum.defer(a=3, b=5)        # Somewhere in your program, run a worker (actually, it's often a        # different program than the one deferring jobs for execution)        app.run_worker(queues=[&quot;sums&quot;])The worker will run the job, which will create a text filenamed ``myfile`` with the result of the sum ``3 + 5`` (that's ``8``).Similarly, from the command line:.. code-block:: bash    export PROCRASTINATE_APP=&quot;mycode.app&quot;    # Launch a job    procrastinate defer mycode.sum '{&quot;a&quot;: 3, &quot;b&quot;: 5}'    # Run a worker    procrastinate worker -q sumsLastly, you can use Procrastinate asynchronously too:.. code-block:: python    import asyncio    import procrastinate    # Make an app in your code    app = procrastinate.App(connector=procrastinate.AiopgConnector())    # Define tasks using coroutine functions    @app.task(queue=&quot;sums&quot;)    async def sum(a, b):        await asyncio.sleep(a + b)    async with app.open_async():        # Launch a job        await sum.defer_async(a=3, b=5)        # Somewhere in your program, run a worker (actually, it's often a        # different program than the one deferring jobs for execution)        await app.run_worker_async(queues=[&quot;sums&quot;])There are quite a few interesting features that Procrastinate adds to the mix.You can head to the Quickstart section for a general tour orto the How-To sections for specific features. The Discussionsection should hopefully answer your questions. Otherwise,feel free to open an `issue &lt;https://github.com/procrastinate-org/procrastinate/issues&gt;`_.The project is still quite early-stage and will probably evolve.*Note to my future self: add a quick note here on why this project is named*&quot;Procrastinate_&quot;... _Procrastinate: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination..
