	<longdescription># MLTU - Machine Learning Training UtilitiesMachine Learning Training Utilities for &lt;b&gt;TensorFlow 2.*&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;PyTorch&lt;/b&gt; with Python 3&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://pylessons.com/media/Tutorials/mltu/machine-learning-training-utilities.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;# Installation:To use MLTU in your own project, you can install it from PyPI:```bashpip install mltu```When running tutorials, it's necessary to install mltu for a specific tutorial, for example:```bashpip install mltu==0.1.3```Each tutorial has its own requirements.txt file for a specific mltu version. As this project progress, the newest versions may have breaking changes, so it's recommended to use the same version as in the tutorial.# Tutorials and Examples can be found on [PyLessons.com](https://pylessons.com/mltu)1.
