The correctsettings are already set in `setup.cfg`. Therefore the following commandshould be enough:.. code::    yapf file.py --in-placeTesting-------For testing, we use ``py.test``:.. code::    pytestThe dependencies are automatically installed by `pytest-runner`_ when you run the tests. The test-dependencies are listed in the ``testing`` field inside the ``[options.extras_require]`` section of ``setup.cfg``.For some reasons, the dependencies are not installed as expected. To workaround, do:.. code::    pip install pytest-covThe files used for testing are included in this package. They are however subject to other `terms and conditions`_.Known Issues------------No known issues - please `open an issue`_ in case you come across a malfunctioning in the package... _qa4sm service: https://qa4sm.eu.. _pyscaffold: https://pyscaffold.org.. _pytest-runner: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-runner.. _terms and conditions: https://qa4sm.eu/terms.. _open an issue: https://github.com/awst-austria/qa4sm-reader/issues</longdescription>
