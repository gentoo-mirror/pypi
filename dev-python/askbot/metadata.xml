Complex cases must be accompanied with the new unit tests.**Before suggesting PR's for new features - please first discuss those features in the &quot;Issues section&quot;**. We really appreciate your efforts, but PR's may not be accepted and it might be disappointing - so please communicate. The bandwidth for the testing is valuable and limited and we would like to avoid &quot;easter eggs&quot; and the feature overload.**Please always use feature branches for the PR's**, multiple feature/bugfix PR's are harder to understand and less likely to be accepted.**Translators: please translate at the Transifex, not via github!!!** https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/askbot/.All documentation is in the directory askbot/docFollow https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo to to learn how to use`fetch` and `push` as well as other help on using git.License, copyright and trademarks=================================Askbot software is licensed under GPL, version 3.Copyright Askbot S.p.A and the project contributors, 2010-2023.&quot;Askbot&quot; is a trademark and service mark registered in the United States, number 4323777.</longdescription>
