	<longdescription># solc-selectA tool to quickly switch between Solidity compiler versions.The tool is split into two CLI utilities:- `solc-select`: manages installing and setting different `solc` compiler versions- `solc`: wrapper around `solc` which picks the right version according to what was set via `solc-select`The `solc` binaries are downloaded from https://binaries.soliditylang.org/ which containsofficial artifacts for many historial and modern `solc` versions for Linux and macOS.The downloaded binaries are stored in `~/.solc-select/artifacts/`.## Quickstart```pip3 install solc-select```## UsageThe global version of `solc` can be set with the `solc-select use &lt;version&gt;` command:```$ solc --versionsolc, the solidity compiler commandline interfaceVersion: 0.5.2+commit.1df8f40c.Linux.g++$ solc-select use 0.4.24Switched global version to 0.4.24$ solc --versionsolc, the solidity compiler commandline interfaceVersion: 0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.Linux.g++```Use `SOLC_VERSION` environment variable to override the global version:```$ solc --versionsolc, the solidity compiler commandline interfaceVersion: 0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.Linux.g++$ SOLC_VERSION=0.5.2 solc --versionsolc, the solidity compiler commandline interfaceVersion: 0.5.2+commit.1df8f40c.Linux.g++```You can list all available versions with `solc-select install`:```$ solc-select installAvailable versions to install:0.3.60.4.0...0.8.00.8.1```And install the one you need with `solc-select install &lt;version&gt;`:```$ solc-select install 0.8.1Installing '0.8.1'...Version '0.8.1' installed.```Display the currently installed versions:```$ solc-select versions0.8.00.4.2 (current, set by /Users/artur/.solc-select/global-version)```## Getting HelpFeel free to stop by our [Slack channel](https://empirehacking.slack.com/) for help on using or extending `solc-select`.## FAQ### solc-version not changing after running `solc-select use [version]` or setting `SOLC_VERSION`Uninstall other installations of solc on your machine. `solc-select` re-installs solc binaries for your operating system and acts as a wrapper for solc. With duplicate solc installations, this may result in your `solc` version not being up to date.### &quot;Unsupported Platform&quot; on Windows The solc-select version that supports Windows is currently in beta. Uninstall `solc-select` through `pip3 uninstall solc-select` and run ```bash pip install solc-select==1.0.0b1```Alternatively, for the most up-to-date version, clone this repository and run ```bash pip install . --user```## Known Issues### `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` on running `solc-select` commands [investigation ongoing]**OS X**```bashpip3 install certifi/Applications/Python\ 3.8/Install\ Certificates.command```Python distributions on OS X has no certificates and cannot validate SSL connections, a breaking change introduced in Python 3.6. See [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42334357) post for additional details.### `Connection refused` [investigation ongoing]```bashpip3 uninstall solc-select pip3 install solc-select==0.2.0solc-select install ```Try downgrading to `solc-select version 0.2.0`. Our `0.2.1` version of `solc-select` pulls older Linux binaries from [crytic/solc](https://github.com/crytic/solc) which seems to have introduced unexpected behavior in certain instances.### `solc-select` version changes, but `solc --version does not match`Users seem to be experiencing situations in which the following command is successful: ```solc-select use &lt;version&gt; ```However, when running the following command, it points to an older version of Solidity.```solc --version````solc-select` is intended to work with custom binaries. This means that Solidity installed through other means (i.e: `brew install solidity`) will _not_ work!. Uninstall other versions Solidity from your computer.## License`solc-select` is licensed and distributed under the [AGPLv3](LICENSE) license.
