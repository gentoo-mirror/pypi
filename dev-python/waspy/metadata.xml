	<longdescription># WASPyWaspy is the python framework for the [WASP project](https://github.com/wasp/wasp).     In other words its an asynchronous &quot;transport-agnostic&quot; web framework.## Language agnostic conceptsWhile this framework is for python, the patterns used in wasp are languageagnostic. You should be able to call other services in different languagesassuming they all follow the same patterns. This framework has a pluggablearchitecture for the transport layer, which allows you to switch fromhttp to using a message bus, or vice-versa. You could even listen on bothat the same time without having to modify your code at all.## ExampleLook at `examples/` folder for some quick examples, or there is an entire example repo at https://github.com/wasp/waspy-example## AlphaThis project is currently in alpha state. There are a lot of features missing.Features for beta:- [x] HTTP Transport- [x] Routing- [x] RabbitMQ transporty- [x] Support middlewares- [x] Client library (for calling other services)- [x] HTTP client transport (with envvar service discovery)- [x] RabbitMQ client transport- [ ] Test everythingnote: all alpha features are complete, but I am still in the process of adding more robusts tests. Until that is done, waspy will remain in alpha and api's might change. Wish List:- [ ] Transport classes for nats (nats.io)- [ ] Transport classes for kafka- [ ] Transport classes for gRPC - [ ] pattern for synchronous &quot;worker-tier&quot;- [x] configuration package- [ ] auto-reloading when in debug mode- [x] sentry integration- [ ] jwt handlingFeatures for GA (1.0):- [ ] High level &quot;Falcon-like&quot; api for writing RESTFUL endpoints even easier!- [ ] High level can be overridden by lower level for control/performance reasons- [ ] Stable/proven API## LicenseApache-2.0## InstallingTo install, just run `pip install waspy`## Developing`python setup.py develop`</longdescription>
