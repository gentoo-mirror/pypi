	<longdescription>glypy Glycan Analysis and Glycoinformatics Library for Python-------------------------------------------------------------|https://img.shields.io/travis/mobiusklein/glypy.svg| |DocumentationStatus|Glycobiology is the study of the biological functions, properties, andstructures of carbohydrate biomolecules, also called *glycans*. Theselarge, tree-like molecules are complex, having a wide variety ofbuilding blocks as well as modifications and substitutions on thosebuilding blocks.`glypy` is a Python library providing code for reading, writing, andmanipulating glycan structures, glycan compositions, monosaccharides, andtheir substituents. It also includes interfaces to popular glycan structuredatabases, `GlyTouCan &lt;https://glytoucan.org/&gt;`_ and `UnicarbKB &lt;http://www.unicarbkb.org/&gt;`_using `SPARQL` queries and an RDF-object mapper.Example Use Cases~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1. Traverse structures using either canonical or residue-level rule   ordering.2. Operate on monosaccharide and substituents as nodes and bonds as   edges.3. Add, remove, and modify these structures to alter glycan properties.4. Identify substructures and motifs, classifying glycans.5. Evaluate structural similarities with one of several ordering and   comparator methods.6. Plot tree structures with MatPlotLib, rendering using a configurable   symbol nomenclature, such as SNFG, CFG, or IUPAC. Layout using vector   graphics for lossless scaling.7. Calculate the mass of a native or derivatized glycan.8. Generate glycosidic and cross ring cleavage fragments for a   collection of glycan structures for performing MS/MS database search.9. Perform substructure similarity searches with exact ordering or   topological comparison and exact or fuzzy per-residue matching to   classify a structure as an N-linked glycan.10. Annotate MS spectra with glycan structures, labeling which peaks    matched a database entry.11. Download all N-Glycans from `GlyTouCan &lt;https://glytoucan.org/&gt;`__12. Find all glycans in a list which contain a particular subtree, or    find common subtrees in a database of glycans, performing treelet    enrichment analysis.13. Synthesize all possible glycans using a set of enzymes starting from    a set of seed structures... |https://img.shields.io/travis/mobiusklein/glypy.svg| image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/mobiusklein/glypy.svg   :target: https://travis-ci.org/mobiusklein/glypy.. |Documentation Status| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/glypy/badge/?version=latest   :target: http://glypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latestCiting~~~~~~If you use `glypy` in a publication please cite:    Klein, J., &amp; Zaia, J.
