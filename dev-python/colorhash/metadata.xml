	<longdescription># color-hash**Generate a color based on a value**This module generates a color based on an object, by calculating a color valuebased on a hash value for the object. This means the result is deterministic:the same value will always result in the same color (so long as the hashfunction remains deterministic).This module is a port of the [color-hash Javascript library](https://github.com/zenozeng/color-hash).It supports Python 3.6+.## Quick Start```python&gt;&gt;&gt; from colorhash import ColorHash&gt;&gt;&gt; c = ColorHash('Hello World')&gt;&gt;&gt; c.hsl(131, 0.65, 0.5)&gt;&gt;&gt; c.rgb(45, 210, 75)&gt;&gt;&gt; c.hex'#2dd24b'```## InstallationIts hosted on PyPI.```bashpip install colorhash```## Changelog- color-hash 1.2.0 *(2022-10-17)*  - Use typing supporting python3.6- color-hash 1.1.0 *(2022-09-01)*  - Add tests  - Add installation instructions- color-hash 1.0.4 *(2021-11-30)*  - Support only for python 3.6+  - Add tests- color-hash 1.0.3 *(2020-12-04)*  - Drop support for python 2  - Handover of project maintenance- color-hash 1.0.2 *(2016-07-08)*  - Add ``crc32_hash`` function and set default hashfunc to that. It's not    fully backwards-compatible, but I don't want to bump the version a lot for    not doing my research.- color-hash 1.0.0 *(2016-07-07)*  - Initial port.## LicenseCopyright (c) 2016 Felix Krull &lt;f_krull@gmx.de&gt;This is a port of the 'color-hash' Javascript library which is:Copyright (c) 2015 Zeno ZengPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy ofthis software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal inthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights touse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies ofthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESSFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
