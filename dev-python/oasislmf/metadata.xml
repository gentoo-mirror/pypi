It can generate ground-up losses (GUL), direct/insured losses (IL) and reinsurance losses (RIL). It can also generate deterministic losses at all these levels.## Releases and maintenanceReleases are published on a monthly cadence which tracks our team's development cycle. The planned fixes, enhancements and features can be seen on the [project development board](https://github.com/orgs/OasisLMF/projects/37) before each release.&gt; Note: From April 2022 and on the oasis release cycle is changing, the monthly published versions are switching to become 'pre-release' builds and the Long term support releases (currently 1.15.x and 1.23.x) will be the new 'standard oasis releases' for production use.In practice, this is a shift in release labels which should better align with the intended use cases. Monthly builds are viewed as intermediate releases for testing new features, while the standard releases (marked by an increase in the minor version number 1.27.0 -&gt; 1.28.0)are stable builds.#### Example of the updated Release tags    (Current latest version) `1.25.1`   * April 8th - `1.26.0rc1` (Intermediate Monthly)   * May 5th - `1.26.0rc2` (Intermediate Monthly)   * June 2nd - `1.26.0rc3` (Intermediate Monthly)   * July 7th - `1.26.0` (Oasis Release for production),   * August 4th - `1.26.1` (Backported fixes for production),   * August 4th - `1.27.0rc1` (Intermediate Monthly),#### Release Cycle (Intermediate Monthly)Release candidates are published on the first Thursday of each month, and tagged as `&lt;version&gt;rc&lt;candidate-version&gt;` and can be installed using `pip install oasislmf --pre`#### Release Cycle (Production Builds)The 'Standard release' which will replace the LTS tags will work in the same way. These are stable versions of oasis intended for production use which will be published on a 6 monthly cycle (approximately).Oasis will backport stability fixes and security updates from the Monthly builds which are released alongside the `intermediate monthly` builds. Backport branches  will still keep the format `backports/&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.x`.&gt; Note: Backported fixes to the existing `LTS` release will continue to be tagged in the same way until the next main oasis release is published as `1.27.0`## FeaturesFor running models locally the CLI provides a `model` subcommand with the following options:* `model generate-exposure-pre-analysis`: generate new Exposure input using user custom code (ex: geo-coding, exposure enhancement, or dis-aggregation...)* `model generate-keys`: generates Oasis keys files from model lookups; these are essentially line items of (location ID, peril ID, coverage type ID, area peril ID, vulnerability ID) where peril ID and coverage type ID span the full set of perils and coverage types that the model supports; if the lookup is for a complex/custom model the keys file will have the same format except that area peril ID and vulnerability ID are replaced by a model data JSON string* `model generate-oasis-files`: generates the Oasis input CSV files for losses (GUL, GUL + IL, or GUL + IL + RIL); it requires the provision of source exposure and optionally source accounts and reinsurance info. and scope files (in OED format), as well as assets for instantiating model lookups and generating keys files* `model generate-losses`: generates losses (GUL, or GUL + IL, or GUL + IL + RIL) from a set of pre-existing Oasis files* `model run`: runs the model from start to finish by generating losses (GUL, or GUL + IL, or GUL + IL + RIL) from the source exposure, and optionally source accounts and reinsurance info. and scope files (in OED or RMS format), as well as assets related to lookup instantiation and keys file generationThe optional `--summarise-exposure` flag can be issued with `model generate-oasis-files` and `model run` to generate a summary of Total Insured Values (TIVs) grouped by coverage type and peril. This produces the `exposure_summary_report.json` file.For remote model execution the `api` subcommand provides the following main subcommand:* `api run`: runs the model remotely (same as `model run`) but via the Oasis APIFor generating deterministic losses an `exposure run` subcommand is available:* `exposure run`: generates deterministic losses (GUL, or GUL + IL, or GUL + IL + RIL)The reusable libraries are organised into several sub-packages, the most relevant of which from a model developer or user's perspective are:* `api_client`* `model_preparation`* `model_execution`* `utils`## Minimum Python RequirementsStarting from 1st January 2019, Pandas will no longer be supporting Python 2. As Pandas is a key dependency of the MDK we are **dropping Python 2 (2.7) support** as of this release (1.3.4). The last version which still supports Python 2.7 is version `1.3.3` (published 12/03/2019).Also for this release (and all future releases) a **minimum of Python 3.7 is required**.## InstallationThe latest released version of the package, or a specific package version, can be installed using `pip`:    pip install oasislmf[==&lt;version string&gt;]Alternatively you can install the latest development version using:    pip install git+{https,ssh}://git@github.com/OasisLMF/OasisLMFYou can also install from a specific branch `&lt;branch name&gt;` using:    pip install [-v] git+{https,ssh}://git@github.com/OasisLMF/OasisLMF.git@&lt;branch name&gt;#egg=oasislmf## Enable Bash completionBash completion is a functionality which bash helps users type their commands by presenting possible options when users press the tab key while typing a command.Once oasislmf is installed you'll need to be activate the feature by sourcing a bash file. (only needs to be run once)### Local    oasislmf admin enable-bash-complete### Global    echo 'complete -C completer_oasislmf oasislmf' | sudo tee /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/oasislmf## Dependencies### SystemThe package provides a built-in lookup framework (`oasislmf.model_preparation.lookup.OasisLookup`) which uses the Rtree Python package, which in turn requires the `libspatialindex` spatial indexing C library.https://libspatialindex.github.io/index.htmlLinux users can install the development version of `libspatialindex` from the command line using `apt`.    [sudo] apt install -y libspatialindex-devand OS X users can do the same via `brew`.    brew install spatialindexThe PiWind demonstration model uses the built-in lookup framework, therefore running PiWind or any model which uses the built-in lookup, requires that you install `libspatialindex`.#### GNU/LinuxFor GNU/Linux the following is a specific list of required system libraries * **Debian**: g++ compiler build-essential, libtool, zlib1g-dev autoconf on debian distros     sudo apt install g++ build-essential libtool zlib1g-dev autoconf * **Red Hat**: 'Development Tools' and zlib-devel### PythonPackage Python dependencies are controlled by `pip-tools`. To install the development dependencies first, install `pip-tools` using:    pip install pip-toolsand run:    pip-syncTo add new dependencies to the development requirements add the package name to `requirements.in` orto add a new dependency to the installed package add the package name to `requirements-package.in`.Version specifiers can be supplied to the packages but these should be kept as loose as possible so thatall packages can be easily updated and there will be fewer conflict when installing.After adding packages to either `*.in` file:    pip-compile &amp;&amp; pip-syncshould be ran ensuring the development dependencies are kept up to date.## TestingTo test the code style run:    flake8To test against all supported python versions run:    toxTo test against your currently installed version of python run:    py.testTo run the full test suite run:    ./runtests.sh## PublishingBefore publishing the latest version of the package make you sure increment the `__version__` value in `oasislmf/__init__.py`, and commit the change. You'll also need to install the `twine` Python package which `setuptools` uses for publishing packages on PyPI. If publishing wheels then you'll also need to install the `wheel` Python package.### Using the `publish` subcommand in `setup.py`The distribution format can be either a source distribution or a platform-specific wheel. To publish the source distribution package run:    python setup.py publish --sdistor to publish the platform specific wheel run:    python setup.py publish --wheel### Creating a bdist for another platformTo create a distribution for a non-host platform use the `--plat-name` flag:     python setup.py bdist_wheel --plat-name Linux_x86_64     or     python setup.py bdist_wheel --plat-name Darwin_x86_64### Manually publishing, with a GPG signatureThe first step is to create the distribution package with the desired format: for the source distribution run:    python setup.py sdistwhich will create a `.tar.gz` file in the `dist` subfolder, or for the platform specific wheel run:    python setup.py bdist_wheelwhich will create `.whl` file in the `dist` subfolder. To attach a GPG signature using your default private key you can then run:    gpg --detach-sign -a dist/&lt;package file name&gt;.{tar.gz,whl}This will create `.asc` signature file named `&lt;package file name&gt;.{tar.gz,whl}.asc` in `dist`. You can just publish the package with the signature using:    twine upload dist/&lt;package file name&gt;.{tar.gz,whl} dist/&lt;package file name&gt;.{tar.gz,whl}.asc## Documentation* &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OasisLMF/OasisLMF/issues&quot;&gt;Issues&lt;/a&gt;* &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OasisLMF/OasisLMF/releases&quot;&gt;Releases&lt;/a&gt;* &lt;a href=&quot;https://oasislmf.github.io&quot;&gt;General Oasis documentation&lt;/a&gt;* &lt;a href=&quot;https://oasislmf.github.io/docs/oasis_mdk.html&quot;&gt;Model Development Kit (MDK)&lt;/a&gt;* &lt;a href=&quot;https://oasislmf.github.io/OasisLmf/modules.html&quot;&gt;Modules&lt;/a&gt;## LicenseThe code in this project is licensed under BSD 3-clause license.</longdescription>
