This is a simple tool for generating boilerplate for data objects. Notes: - Tries to be inplace, the dict you start with should still exist with the structure+type corrections applied. - Let IDEs check type annotations and attribute spelling. - Let you annotate fields with metadata that other systems may need in order to process the document properly. - Properties and methods are copied in.</longdescription>
