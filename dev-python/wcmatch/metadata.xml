In some ways these libraries are similar to Python'sbuiltin libraries as they provide a similar interface to match, filter, and glob the file system. But they also includea number of features found in Bash's globbing such as backslash escaping, brace expansion, extended glob pattern groups,etc. They also add a number of new useful functions as well, such as `globmatch` which functions like `fnmatch`, but forpaths.Wildcard Match also adds a file search utility called `wcmatch` that is built on top of `fnmatch` and `globmatch`. Itwas originally written for [Rummage](https://github.com/facelessuser/Rummage), but split out into this project to beused by other projects that may find its approach useful.Bash is used as a guide when making decisions on behavior for `fnmatch` and `glob`. Behavior may differ from Bashversion to Bash version, but an attempt is made to keep Wildcard Match up with the latest relevant changes. With all ofthis said, there may be a few corner cases in which we've intentionally chosen to not *exactly* mirror Bash. If an issueis found where Wildcard Match seems to deviate in an illogical way, we'd love to hear about it in the[issue tracker](https://github.com/facelessuser/wcmatch/issues).## FeaturesA quick overview of Wildcard Match's Features:- Provides an interface comparable to Python's builtin in `fnmatch`, `glob`, and `pathlib`.- Allows for a much more configurable experience when matching or globbing with many more features.- Adds support for `**` in glob.- Adds support for escaping characters with `\`.- Add support for POSIX style character classes inside sequences: `[[:alnum:]]`, etc. The `C` locale is used.- Adds support for brace expansion: `a{b,{c,d}}` --&gt; `ab ac ad`.- Adds support for expanding `~` or `~username` to the appropriate user path.- Adds support for extended match patterns: `@(...)`, `+(...)`, `*(...)`, `?(...)`, and `!(...)`.- Adds ability to match path names via the path centric `globmatch`.- Provides a `pathlib` variant that uses Wildcard Match's `glob` library instead of Python's default.- Provides an alternative file crawler called `wcmatch`.- And more...## InstallationInstallation is easy with pip:```pip install wcmatch```## Documentationhttps://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/## LicenseThe MIT License (MIT)Copyright (c) 2018 - 2022 Isaac MusePermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
