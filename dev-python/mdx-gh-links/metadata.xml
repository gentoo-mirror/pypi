	<longdescription># Python-Markdown Github-Links ExtensionAn extension to Python-Markdown which adds support for shorthand links to GitHubusers, repositories, issues and commits.## InstallationTo install the extension run the following command:```shpip install mdx-gh-links```## UsageTo use the extension simply include its name in the list of extensions passed toPython-Markdown.```pythonimport markdownmarkdown.markdown(src, extensions=['mdx_gh_links'])```### Configuration OptionsTo set configuration options, you may pass them to Markdown's `exension_configs`keyword...```pythonmarkdown.markdown(    src,    extensions=['mdx_gh_links'],    extension_configs={        'mdx_gh_links': {'user': 'foo', 'repo': 'bar'}    })```... or you may import and pass the configs directly to an instance of the`mdx_gh_links.GithubLinks` class...```pythonfrom mdx_gh_links import GithubLinksmarkdown.markdown(src, extensions=[GithubLinks(user='foo', repo='bar')])```The following configuration options are available:#### userA GitHub user name or organization. If no user or organization is specified ina GitHub link, then the value of this option will be used.#### repoA GitHub repository. If no repository is specified in a GitHub link, then thevalue of this option will be used.## SyntaxThis extension implements shorthand to specify links to GitHub in various ways.All links in the generated HTML are assigned a `gh-link` class as well as a classunique to that type of link. See each type for the specific class assigned.### MentionsLink directly to a GitHub user, organization or repository. Note that noverification is made that an actual user, organization or repository exists. Asthe syntax does not differentiate between users and organizations, allorganizations are assumed to be users. However, this assumption is onlyreflected in the title of a link.Mentions use the format `@{user}` to link to a user or organization and`@{user}/{repo}` to link to a repository. The defaults defined in theconfiguration options are ignored by mentions. A mention may be escaped byadding a backslash immediately before the at sign (`@`).All mentions are assigned the `gh-mention` class.The following table provides some examples:| shorthand   | href                         | rendered result                                                                     || ----------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- || `@foo`      | `https://github.com/foo`     | [@foo](https://github.com/foo &quot;GitHub User: @foo&quot;)                   || `@foo/bar`  | `https://github.com/foo/bar` | [@foo/bar](https://github.com/foo/bar &quot;GitHub Repository: @foo/bar&quot;) || `\@foo`     |                              | @foo                                                                 || `\@foo/bar` |                              | @foo/bar                                                             |### IssuesLink directly to a GitHub issue or pull request (PR). Note that no verificationis made that an actual issue or PR exists. As the syntax does not differentiatebetween Issues and PRs, all URLs point to &quot;issues&quot;. Fortunately, GitHub willproperly redirect an issue URL to a PR URL if appropriate.Issue links use the format `#{num}` or `{user}/{repo}#{num}`. `{num}` is thenumber assigned to the issue or PR. `{user}` and `{repo}` will use thedefaults defined in the configuration options if not provided. An issue link maybe escaped by adding a backslash immediately before the hash mark (`#`).All issue links are assigned the `gh-issue` class.The following table provides various examples (with the defaults set as`user='user', repo='repo'`):| shorthand      | href                                         | rendered result                                                                     || -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- || `#123`         | `https://github.com/user/repo/issues/123`    | [#123](https://github.com/user/repo/issues/123 &quot;GitHub Issue user/repo #123&quot;)       || `foo/bar#123`  | `https://github.com/foo/bar/issues/123`      | [foo/bar#123](https://github.com/foo/bar/issues/123 &quot;GitHub Issue foo/bar #123&quot;)    || `\#123`        |                                              | #123                                                                                || `foo/bar\#123` |                                              | foo/bar#123                                                                         |### CommitsLink directly to a GitHub Commit. Note that no verification is made that anactual commit exists.Commit links consist of a complete 40 character SHA hash and may optionally beprefaced by `{user}@` or `{user/repo}@`. `{user}` and `{repo}` will use thedefaults defined in the configuration options if not provided. To avoid a 40character hash from being linked, wrap it in a code span.All commit links are assigned the `gh-commit` class.The following table provides various examples (with the defaults set as`user='user', repo='repo'`):| shorthand                                          | href                                                                              | rendered result                                                                                                                                                 || -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| `72df691791fb36f00cf5363fefe757c8d3042656`         | `https://github.com/user/repo/commit/72df691791fb36f00cf5363fefe757c8d3042656`    | [72df691](https://github.com/user/repo/commit/72df691791fb36f00cf5363fefe757c8d3042656 &quot;GitHub Commit: user/repo@72df691791fb36f00cf5363fefe757c8d3042656&quot;)     || `foo@72df691791fb36f00cf5363fefe757c8d3042656`     | `https://github.com/foo/repo/commit/72df691791fb36f00cf5363fefe757c8d3042656`     | [foo@72df691](https://github.com/foo/repo/commit/72df691791fb36f00cf5363fefe757c8d3042656 &quot;GitHub Commit: foo/repo@72df691791fb36f00cf5363fefe757c8d3042656&quot;)   || `foo/bar@72df691791fb36f00cf5363fefe757c8d3042656` | `https://github.com/foo/bar/commit/72df691791fb36f00cf5363fefe757c8d3042656`      | [foo/bar@72df691](https://github.com/foo/bar/commit/72df691791fb36f00cf5363fefe757c8d3042656 &quot;GitHub Commit: foo/bar@72df691791fb36f00cf5363fefe757c8d3042656&quot;) || `` `72df691791fb36f00cf5363fefe757c8d3042656` ``   |                                                                                   | `72df691791fb36f00cf5363fefe757c8d3042656`                                                                                                                      |## LicenseThe Python-Markdown Github-Links Extension is licensed under the [BSD License] asdefined in `LICENSE`.[BSD License]: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause## Change Log### Version 0.3.1 (2023/07/28)Include README in release.### Version 0.3 (2022/07/18)Update dependencies.### Version 0.2 (2018/03/09)Ignore mentions/issues/commits within Markdown links.### Version 0.1 (2017/11/10)The initial release.</longdescription>
