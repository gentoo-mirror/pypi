	<longdescription>seam_carver is a small tool for retargetting images to any dimension greater or smaller.It uses the process of seam carving as originally described by Shai Avidan &amp; Ariel Shamir in http://perso.crans.org/frenoy/matlab2012/seamcarving.pdfA combination of the gradient energy (determined with the sobel filter) and a simple color energy isused to determine the least important seam. Additon of seams occurs by the same mechanism as describedin the paper.</longdescription>
