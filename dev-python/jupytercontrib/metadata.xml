	<longdescription># jupyter contribSome small utilities that are related to Jupyter. This is not endorsed by the Jupyter team, and not part of the official Jupyter project. Feel free to submit any patches, or utility modules for which a full packagesmight be inappropriate or too much of an hassle. # installation```pip install jupytercontrib```# ExtensionsAny extension present here should not modify Jupyter/IPython behavior at install time. You can provide a tool to simplify activation, but installation should likely be without side-effects. # What can I find here:## 2to3 for notebooksAn extra nbconvert exporter that convert Legacy Python 2 notebook to New Awesome and useful Python 3It requires `nbconvert` master. It uses [entry points]  to directly expose a `--to=2to3` when using `jupyter nbconvert`, thus you can do thing like ```jupyter nbconvert --to 2to3 &lt;mynotebook.ipynb&gt;```This will create a file name `mynotebook.nbconvert.ipynb` which each cell converted to Python 3. ## Markdown exporter w/ outputExtension of the standard notebook-to-markdown exporter that tags output cells as `output`.Can be used, for example, when building Sphinx docs to style output differently from input code blocks. ```jupyter nbconvert --to mdoutput --output=&lt;output.md&gt; &lt;mynotebook.ipynb&gt;```</longdescription>
