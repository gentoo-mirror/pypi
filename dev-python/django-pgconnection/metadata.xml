	<longdescription>django-pgconnection###################``django-pgconnection`` provides primitives for overriding Postgresconnection and cursor objects, making it possible to do the following:1. Hook into SQL generation. For example, it is not possible to log   every time a SQL statement is executed in Django or annotate SQL   with comments so that additional metadata is logged when executing   queries. The `pgconnection.pre_execute_hook` context manager allows   one to hook into SQL before it is executed.2. Route database traffic to a different database. Although Django provides   the ability to construct custom database routers, routing to a different   database has to be instrumented throughout code and can be tedious   and error prone. The `pgconnection.route` context manager can route   any database operations to a different database, even if it's an external   management command that has not been instrumented to use a different   database.The `documentation &lt;https://django-pgconnection.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_ hasexamples of how to use ``django-pgconnection``.Documentation=============`View the django-pgconnection docs here&lt;https://django-pgconnection.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_.Installation============Install django-pgconnection with::    pip3 install django-pgconnectionAfter this, add ``pgconnection`` to the ``INSTALLED_APPS``setting of your Django project.In order to use connection routing and hooks, one must configurethe ``DATABASES`` setting in ``settings.py`` like so::    DATABASES = pgconnection.configure({        'default': {            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',            'NAME': 'mydatabase',        }    })Contributing Guide==================For information on setting up django-pgconnection for development andcontributing changes, view `CONTRIBUTING.rst &lt;CONTRIBUTING.rst&gt;`_.Primary Authors===============- @wesleykendall (Wes Kendall)</longdescription>
