	<longdescription>[![Python package](https://github.com/rhayman/ephysiopy/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rhayman/ephysiopy/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)Synopsis========Tools for the analysis of electrophysiological data collected with the Axona or openephys recording systems.Installation============ephysiopy requires python3.7 or greater. The easiest way to install is using pip:``python3 -m pip install ephysiopy``or,``pip3 install ephysiopy``Or similar.Code Example============Neuropixels / openephys tetrode recordings------------------------------------------For openephys-type analysis there are two main entry classes depending on whether you are doingOpenEphys- or Axona-based analysis. Both classes inherit from the same abstract baseclass (TrialInterface) and so share a high degree of overlap in what they can do. Becauseof the inheritance structure, the methods you call on each concrete class are the same```pythonfrom ephysiopy.io.recording import OpenEphysBasetrial = OpenEphysBase(&quot;/path/to/top_level&quot;)```The &quot;/path/to/top_level&quot; bit here means that if your directory hierarchy looks like this:::    ├── settings.xml    ├── 2020-03-20_12-40-15    |    └── experiment1    |        └── recording1    |            ├── structure.oebin    |            ├── sync_messages.txt    |            ├── continuous    |            |   └── Neuropix-PXI-107.0    |            |       └── continuous.dat    |            └── eventsWalk through the folders/ files to see where the data is:```pythontrial.find_files(&quot;/path/to/top_level&quot;, &quot;experiment1&quot;, &quot;recording1&quot;)```The pos data is loaded by calling the load_pos_data() method:```pythonnpx.load_pos_data(ppm=300, jumpmax=100)```Noteppm = pixels per metre, used to convert pixel coords to cms.jumpmax = maximum &quot;jump&quot; in cms for point to be considered &quot;bad&quot; and smoothed overThe same principles apply to the other classes that inherit from TrialInterface (AxonaTrial and OpenEphysNWB)Plotting data=============A mixin class called FigureMaker allows consistent plots, regardless of recording technique. All plotting functionsthere begin with &quot;make&quot; e.g &quot;makeRateMap&quot; and return an instance of a matplotlib axisMotivation==========Analysis using Axona's Tint cluster cutting program or phy/ phy2 (openephys) is great but limited. This extends that functionality.Optional packages include:* `klustakwik &lt;https://github.com/klusta-team/klustakwik&gt;`_Download the files and extract to a folder and make sure it's on your Python pathNB this is limited to data recorded using Axona as it has now been superceded by tools such as KiloSort/ KiloSort2 etc.Contributors============Robin Hayman.</longdescription>
