It aims to make it easier to create software projects that implement a Bayesianworkflow that scales to arbitrarily many inter-related statistical models, datatransformations, inferences and computations. Bibat also aims to promotesoftware quality by providing a modular, automated and reproducible project thattakes advantage of and integrates together the most up to date statisticalsoftware.Bibat comes with &quot;batteries included&quot; in the sense that it creates a workingexample project, which the user can adapt so that it implements their desiredanalysis. We believe this style of template makes for better usability andeasier testing of Bayesian workflow projects compared with the alternativeapproach of providing an incomplete skeleton project.Documentation=============Check out bibat's documentation at `https://bibat.readthedocs.io&lt;https://bibat.readthedocs.io&gt;`_.In particular, you may find it useful to have a look at `this vignette&lt;https://bibat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/report.html&gt;`_ thatdemonstrates, step by step, how to use bibat to implement a complex statisticalanalysis.Quick Start===========You can try out bibat like this (make sure you are in a Python environment whereyou would like to install bibat and `its dependencies&lt;https://github.com/teddygroves/bibat/blob/main/setup.cfg#L28&gt;`_):.. code:: sh    $ pip install bibat    $ bibatAfter following the wizard's instructions, you should now have a new directoryimplementing a simple statistical analysis. To try it out, run the followingcommand from the root of the new directory:.. code:: sh    $ make analysisTo install the latest version from github:.. code:: sh    $ pip install git+https://github.com/teddygroves/bibat.git@main    Citation information====================If you would like to cite bibat using bibtex please use the following format:.. code:: sh  @software{bibat,    doi = {10.5281/zenodo.7775328},    url = {https://github.com/teddygroves/bibat},    year = {2023},    author = {Teddy Groves},    title = {Bibat: batteries-included Bayesian analysis template},  }</longdescription>
