	<longdescription>ssl===The old socket.ssl() support for TLS over sockets is beingsuperseded in Python 2.6 by a new 'ssl' module.  This packagebrings that module to older Python releases, 2.3.5 and up (it mayalso work on older versions of 2.3, but we haven't tried it).It's quite similar to the 2.6 ssl module.  There's no stand-alonedocumentation for this package; instead, just use the developmentbranch documentation for the SSL module athttp://docs.python.org/dev/library/ssl.html.Version 1.0 had a problem with Python 2.5.1 -- the structure ofthe socket object changed from earlier versions.Version 1.1 was missing various package metadata information.Version 1.2 added more package metadata, and support forssl.get_server_certificate(), and the PEM-to-DER encode/decoderoutines.  Plus integrated Paul Moore's patch to setup.py forWindows.  Plus added support for asyncore, and asyncore HTTPSserver test.Version 1.3 fixed a bug in the test suite.Version 1.4 incorporated use of -static switch.Version 1.5 fixed bug in Python version check affecting build onPython 2.5.0.Version 1.7 (and 1.6) fixed some bugs with asyncore support (recv andsend not being called on the SSLSocket class, wrong semantics forsendall).Version 1.8 incorporated some code from Chris Stawarz to handlesockets which are set to non-blocking before negotiating the SSLsession.Version 1.9 makes ssl.SSLError a subtype of socket.error.Version 1.10 fixes a bug in sendall().Version 1.11 includes the MANIFEST file, and by default will turneunexpected EOFs occurring during a read into a regular EOF.  It alsoremoves the code for SSLFileStream, to use the regular socket module's_fileobject instead.Version 1.12 fixes the bug in SSLSocket.accept() reported by GeorgBrandl, and adds a test case for that fix.Version 1.13 fixes a bug in calling do_handshake() automaticallyon non-blocking sockets.  Thanks to Giampaolo Rodola.  Now includesreal asyncore test case.Version 1.14 incorporates some fixes to naming (rename &quot;recv_from&quot; to&quot;recvfrom&quot; and &quot;send_to&quot; to &quot;sendto&quot;), and a fix to the asyncore testcase to unregister the connection handler when the connection isclosed.  It also exposes the SSL shutdown via the &quot;unwrap&quot; methodon an SSLSocket.  It exposes &quot;subjectPublicKey&quot; in the data receivedfrom a peer cert.Version 1.15 fixes a bug in write retries, where the output buffer haschanged location because of garbage collection during the interim.It also provides the new flag, PROTOCOL_NOSSLv2, which selects SSL23,but disallows actual use of SSL2.Version 1.16 removes installing tests system-wide (which fixes the&quot;permission denied&quot; error when installing in virtualenvs), adds ``/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu`` and ``/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`` to thesearch path (which fixes compilation on ubuntu 12.04) and stopped using``SSLv2_method`` if it's not present. Many thanks to `Denis Bilenko`_for providing those fixes through his temporary sslfix_ fork.The package is now maintained (bugfix only) by PyPA_.Authorship: A cast of dozens over the years have written the PythonSSL support, including Marc-Alan Lemburg, Robin Dunn, GvR, KalleSvensson, Skip Montanaro, Mark Hammond, Martin von Loewis, JeremyHylton, Andrew Kuchling, Georg Brandl, Bill Janssen, Chris Stawarz,Neal Norwitz, and many others.  Thanks to Paul Moore, David Bolen andMark Hammond for help with the Windows side of the house.  And it'sall based on OpenSSL, which has its own cast of dozens!.. _PyPA: https://github.com/pypa.. _`Denis Bilenko`: https://github.com/denik.. _`sslfix`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sslfixInstallation------------To install it, run::  pip install sslor download it from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sslIssues------Feel free to report issues at https://github.com/pypa/ssl/issues</longdescription>
