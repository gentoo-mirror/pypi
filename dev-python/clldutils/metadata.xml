Over time, it turned into a toolbox for various data curation tasks, with a focus on cross-linguisticdata (as reflected by modules such as `clldutils.iso_639_3` or `clldutils.sfm`).Design goals are- wide applicability of the included functionality- small number of dependencies, thus wide installability## APIDocumentation of the package is at https://clldutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html</longdescription>
