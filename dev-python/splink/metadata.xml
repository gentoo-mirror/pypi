Splink's linkage algorithm is based on Fellegi-Sunter's model of record linkage, with various customizations to improve accuracy.## What does Splink do?Consider the following records that lack a unique person identifier:![tables showing what splink does](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/master/docs/img/README/what_does_splink_do_1.drawio.png)Splink predicts which rows link together:![tables showing what splink does](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/master/docs/img/README/what_does_splink_do_2.drawio.png)and clusters these links to produce an estimated person ID:![tables showing what splink does](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/master/docs/img/README/what_does_splink_do_3.drawio.png)## What data does Splink work best with?Before using Splink, input data should be standardized, with consistent column names and formatting (e.g., lowercased, punctuation cleaned up, etc.).Splink performs best with input data containing **multiple** columns that are **not highly correlated**. For instance, if the entity type is persons, you may have columns for full name, date of birth, and city. If the entity type is companies, you could have columns for name, turnover, sector, and telephone number.High correlation occurs when the value of a column is highly constrained (predictable) from the value of another column. For example, a 'city' field is almost perfectly correlated with 'postcode'. Gender is highly correlated with 'first name'. Correlation is particularly problematic if **all** of your input columns are highly correlated.Splink is not designed for linking a single column containing a 'bag of words'. For example, a table with a single 'company name' column, and no other details.## DocumentationThe homepage for the Splink documentation can be found [here](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/). Interactive demos can be found [here](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink/tree/master/docs/demos), or by clicking the following Binder link:[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/moj-analytical-services/splink/binder_branch?labpath=docs%2Fdemos%2Ftutorials%2F00_Tutorial_Introduction.ipynb)The specification of the Fellegi Sunter statistical model behind `splink` is similar as that used in the R [fastLink package](https://github.com/kosukeimai/fastLink). Accompanying the fastLink package is an [academic paper](http://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/files/linkage.pdf) that describes this model. The [Splink documentation site](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/topic_guides/fellegi_sunter.html) and a [series of interactive articles](https://www.robinlinacre.com/probabilistic_linkage/) also explores the theory behind Splink.The Office for National Statistics have written a [case study about using Splink](https://github.com/Data-Linkage/Splink-census-linkage/blob/main/SplinkCaseStudy.pdf) to link 2021 Census data to itself.## InstallationSplink supports python 3.8+. To obtain the latest released version of splink you can install from PyPI using pip:```shpip install splink```or, if you prefer, you can instead install splink using conda:```shconda install -c conda-forge splink```&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Additional installation methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;### Backend Specific InstallsFrom Splink v3.9.7, packages required by specific splink backends can be optionally installed by adding the¬†`[&lt;backend&gt;]`¬†suffix to the end of your¬†`pip install`.**Note** that **SQLite** and **DuckDB** come packaged with Splink and do not need to be optionally installed.Backends supported by optional installs:**Spark**```shpip install 'splink[spark]'```**Athena**```shpip install 'splink[athena]'```**PostgreSQL**```shpip install 'splink[postgres]'```&lt;br&gt;### DuckDBLess SplinkShould you require a more bare-bones version of Splink **without DuckDB**, please see the following area of the docs:&gt; [DuckDBless Splink Installation](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/installations.html#duckdb-less-installation)&lt;/details&gt;## QuickstartThe following code demonstrates how to estimate the parameters of a deduplication model, use it to identify duplicate records, and then use clustering to generate an estimated unique person ID.For more detailed tutorial, please see [here](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/demos/00_Tutorial_Introduction.html).```pyfrom splink.duckdb.linker import DuckDBLinkerimport splink.duckdb.comparison_library as climport splink.duckdb.comparison_template_library as ctlfrom splink.duckdb.blocking_rule_library import block_onfrom splink.datasets import splink_datasetsdf = splink_datasets.fake_1000settings = {    &quot;link_type&quot;: &quot;dedupe_only&quot;,    &quot;blocking_rules_to_generate_predictions&quot;: [        block_on(&quot;first_name&quot;),        block_on(&quot;surname&quot;),    ],    &quot;comparisons&quot;: [        ctl.name_comparison(&quot;first_name&quot;),        ctl.name_comparison(&quot;surname&quot;),        ctl.date_comparison(&quot;dob&quot;, cast_strings_to_date=True),        cl.exact_match(&quot;city&quot;, term_frequency_adjustments=True),        ctl.email_comparison(&quot;email&quot;, include_username_fuzzy_level=False),    ],}linker = DuckDBLinker(df, settings)linker.estimate_u_using_random_sampling(max_pairs=1e6)blocking_rule_for_training = block_on([&quot;first_name&quot;, &quot;surname&quot;])linker.estimate_parameters_using_expectation_maximisation(blocking_rule_for_training, estimate_without_term_frequencies=True)blocking_rule_for_training = block_on(&quot;dob&quot;)linker.estimate_parameters_using_expectation_maximisation(blocking_rule_for_training, estimate_without_term_frequencies=True)pairwise_predictions = linker.predict()clusters = linker.cluster_pairwise_predictions_at_threshold(pairwise_predictions, 0.95)clusters.as_pandas_dataframe(limit=5)```## Videos- [A introductory presentation on Splink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msz3T741KQI)- [An introduction to the Splink Comparison Viewer dashboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNvCMqjipis)## Charts GalleryYou can see all of the interactive charts provided in Splink by checking out the [Charts Gallery](./charts/index.md).## SupportTo find the best place to ask a question, report a bug or get general advice, please refer to our [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).## Awardsü•á Analysis in Government Awards 2020: Innovative Methods: [Winner](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/launch-of-the-analysis-in-government-awards)ü•á MoJ DASD Awards 2020: Innovation and Impact - Winnerü•á Analysis in Government Awards 2022: People's Choice Award - [Winner](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/news/announcing-the-winner-of-the-first-analysis-in-government-peoples-choice-award/)ü•à Analysis in Government Awards 2022: Innovative Methods [Runner up](https://twitter.com/gov_analysis/status/1616073633692274689?s=20&amp;t=6TQyNLJRjnhsfJy28Zd6UQ)## CitationIf you use Splink in your research, we'd be grateful for a citation as follows:```BibTeX@article{Linacre_Lindsay_Manassis_Slade_Hepworth_2022,title        = {Splink: Free software for probabilistic record linkage at scale.},author       = {Linacre, Robin and Lindsay, Sam and Manassis, Theodore and Slade, Zoe and Hepworth, Tom and Kennedy, Ross and Bond, Andrew},year         = 2022,month        = {Aug.},journal      = {International Journal of Population Data Science},volume       = 7,number       = 3,doi          = {10.23889/ijpds.v7i3.1794},url          = {https://ijpds.org/article/view/1794},}```## AcknowledgementsWe are very grateful to [ADR UK](https://www.adruk.org/) (Administrative Data Research UK) for providing the initial funding for this work as part of the [Data First](https://www.adruk.org/our-work/browse-all-projects/data-first-harnessing-the-potential-of-linked-administrative-data-for-the-justice-system-169/) project.We are extremely grateful to professors Katie Harron, James Doidge and Peter Christen for their expert advice and guidance in the development of Splink.
