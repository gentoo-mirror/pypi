	<longdescription>=============== Potato ===============General================================================================This project exposes a way to load classes dynamically and tomake sure that each class that is loaded has and adheres to one or more verifiable interfaces.Project Name================================================================The project name started as simply &quot;class registry&quot;, but that seemed really dull and boring.  Totally not entertaining.  So, my wife and I brainstormed and we came up with the idea of a plant, which is both something that grows and somthing that simply produces items according to technical specification(AKA factory).  Then, I started to consider the types of plantsthat we grow which create hearty staples, and potatos came to mind.  And yes, I could have used &quot;potato plant&quot;, but that was too long, so now its just &quot;potato&quot;.  My wife wanted to call it &quot;pytatoe&quot;, but I said that that was too cheesy.  Motivation================================================================I wanted a system for a plug-in architecture.  I got the idea for this project from the following stackoverflow.com question:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5145378/dynamic-module-import-of-class-list-from-module-given-its-full-pathAs I developed it, it became apparent that a construct and/orpattern must have been used in the making of such evil softwareas Microsoft Windows.Usage================================================================See example/ for a usage example.</longdescription>
