	<longdescription># SureberusSureberus is a data validation and transformation tool that is useful for validating and normalizing &quot;documents&quot; (nested data structures of basic Python data-types). You provide a schema which describes the expected structure of an object (and optionally, various directives that modify that structure), along with a document to validate and transform, and it returns the new version.Sureberus's schema format is based on [Cerberus](https://github.com/pyeve/cerberus/). It doesn't implement all of the features of that library, and where it does implement a feature it doesn't always implement it in the exact same way.## DocumentationThere is relatively complete documentation at &lt;a href=&quot;https://radix.github.io/sureberus/&quot;&gt;radix.github.io/sureberus&lt;/a&gt;.</longdescription>
