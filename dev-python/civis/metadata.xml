The package includes a set oftools around common workflows as well as a convenient interface to makerequests directly to the Civis API... end-include-marker-introductory-paragraphPlease see the`full documentation &lt;https://civis-python.readthedocs.io&gt;`_ for more details... start-include-marker-api-keys-sectionAPI Keys--------In order to make requests to the Civis API,you will need a Civis Platform API key that is unique to you.Instructions for creating a new key are found`here &lt;https://civis.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216341583-Generating-an-API-Key&gt;`_.API keys have a set expiration date and new keys will need to be created atleast every 30 days. The API client will look for a ``CIVIS_API_KEY``environmental variable to access your API key, so after creating a new API key,follow the steps below for your operating system to set up your environment.Linux / MacOS~~~~~~~~~~~~~1. Add the following to your shell configuration file (``~/.zshrc`` for MacOS or ``~/.bashrc`` for Linux, by default)::    export CIVIS_API_KEY=&quot;alphaNumericApiK3y&quot;2. Source your shell configuration file (or restart your terminal).Windows 10~~~~~~~~~~1. Navigate to &quot;Settings&quot; -&gt; type &quot;environment&quot; in search bar -&gt;   &quot;Edit environment variables for your account&quot;. This can also be found   in &quot;System Properties&quot; -&gt; &quot;Advanced&quot; -&gt; &quot;Environment Variables...&quot;.2. In the user variables section, if ``CIVIS_API_KEY`` already exists in   the list of environment variables, click on it and press &quot;Edit...&quot;.   Otherwise, click &quot;New..&quot;.3. Enter CIVIS_API_KEY as the &quot;Variable name&quot;.4. Enter your API key as the &quot;Variable value&quot;.  Your API key should look   like a long string of letters and numbers... end-include-marker-api-keys-section.. start-include-marker-installation-sectionInstallation------------After creating an API key and setting the ``CIVIS_API_KEY`` environmentalvariable, install the Python package ``civis`` with the recommended method via ``pip``::    pip install civisAlternatively, if you are interested in the latest functionality not yet released through ``pip``,you may clone the code from GitHub and build from source:.. code-block:: bash   git clone https://github.com/civisanalytics/civis-python.git   cd civis-python   python setup.py installYou can test your installation by running.. code-block:: python    import civis    client = civis.APIClient()    print(client.users.list_me()['username'])If ``civis`` was installed correctly, this will print your CivisPlatform username.The client has a soft dependency on ``pandas`` to support features such asdata type parsing.  If you are using the ``io`` namespace to read or writedata from Civis, it is highly recommended that you install ``pandas`` andset ``use_pandas=True`` in functions that accept that parameter.  To install``pandas``:.. code-block:: bash   pip install pandasMachine learning features in the ``ml`` namespace have a soft dependency on``scikit-learn`` and ``pandas``. Install ``scikit-learn`` toexport your trained models from the Civis Platform or toprovide your own custom models. Use ``pandas`` to download model predictionsfrom the Civis Platform. The ``civis.ml`` codeoptionally uses the `feather &lt;https://github.com/wesm/feather&gt;`_format to transfer data from your local computer to CivisPlatform. Install these dependencies with.. code-block:: bash   pip install scikit-learn   pip install pandas   pip install feather-formatSome CivisML models have open-source dependencies inaddition to ``scikit-learn``, which you may need if you want todownload the model object. These dependencies are``civisml-extensions``, ``glmnet``, and ``muffnn``. Install thesedependencies with.. code-block:: bash   pip install civisml-extensions   pip install glmnet   pip install muffnn.. end-include-marker-installation-sectionUsage-----``civis`` includes a number of wrappers around the Civis API forcommon workflows... code-block:: python    import civis    df = civis.io.read_civis(table=&quot;my_schema.my_table&quot;,                             database=&quot;database&quot;,                             use_pandas=True)The Civis API may also be directly accessed via the ``APIClient`` class... code-block:: python    import civis    client = civis.APIClient()    database = client.databases.list()See the `documentation &lt;https://civis-python.readthedocs.io&gt;`_ for a morecomplete user guide... start-include-marker-retries-sectionRetries-------The API client will automatically retry for certain API error responses.If the error is one of [413, 429, 503] and the API client is told how long it needsto wait before it's safe to retry (this is always the case with 429s, which arerate limit errors), then the client will wait the specified amount of timebefore retrying the request.If the error is one of [429, 502, 503, 504] and the request is not a ``patch*`` or ``post*``method, then the API client will retry the request several times, with an exponential delay,to see if it will succeed. If the request is of type ``post*`` it will retry with the same parametersfor error codes [429, 503]... end-include-marker-retires-sectionBuild Documentation Locally---------------------------To install dependencies for building the documentation::    pip install Sphinx    pip install sphinx_rtd_theme    pip install numpydocTo build the API documentation locally::    cd docs    make htmlThen open ``docs/build/html/index.html``.Note that this will use your API key in the ``CIVIS_API_KEY`` environmentvariable so it will generate documentation for all the endpoints that you have access to.Command-line Interface (CLI)----------------------------After installing the Python package, you'll also have a ``civis`` command accessible from your shell. It surfaces a commandline interface to all of the regular Civis API endpoints, plus a few helpers. To get started, run ``civis --help``.Please see the `CLI documentation &lt;https://civis-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html&gt;`_ for more details.Contributing------------See `CONTRIBUTING.md &lt;CONTRIBUTING.md&gt;`_ for information about contributing to this project.License-------BSD-3See `LICENSE.md &lt;LICENSE.md&gt;`_ for details.For Maintainers---------------The `tools &lt;tools/&gt;`_ directory contains scripts that civis-python maintainers canuse (and maintain...). Please see their docstrings for usage.Non-public information can be found by searching the internal documentation systemor consulting the current maintainers.</longdescription>
