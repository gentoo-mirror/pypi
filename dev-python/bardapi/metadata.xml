Using `__Secure-1PSID`, you can ask questions and get answers from Google Bard. This package is designed for application to the Python package [ExceptNotifier](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/ExceptNotifier) and [Co-Coder](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Co-Coder). Please note that the bardapi is not a free service, but rather a tool provided to assist developers with testing certain functionalities due to the delayed development and release of Google Bard's API. It has been designed with a lightweight structure that can easily adapt to the emergence of an official API. Therefore, I strongly discourage using it for any other purposes. If you have access to official [PaLM-2 API](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-palm-2-ai-large-language-model/), replace the provided response with the corresponding official code.&lt;br&gt;- [Google  Bard API](#google--bard-api)  - [What is Google Bard?](#what-is-google-bard)  - [Install](#install)  - [Authentication](#authentication)  - [Usage](#usage)  - [Further](#further)    - [Behind a proxy](#behind-a-proxy)    - [Reusable session object](#reusable-session-object)  - [Auto Cookie Bard](#auto-cookie-bard)  - [Bard `ask_about_image` method](#bard-ask_about_image-method)  - [Text To Speech(TTS) from Bard](#text-to-speechtts-from-bard)  - [More features](#more-features)&lt;br&gt;## What is Google Bard?Bard is a conversational generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Google, based initially on the LaMDA family of LLMs(Large Language Models) and later the PaLM LLM. Please check official documents for [updates](https://bard.google.com/updates) on Bard, including [available regions and languages](https://support.google.com/bard/answer/13575153?hl=en).## Install```$ pip install bardapi``````$ pip install git+https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API.git```Due to certain dependency packages that are not compatible with 64bit windows(OS), we are releasing a lightweight alpha release of bard that only returns responses for simple requests. This release is a continuation of the pypi `0.1.18` version, which was maintained with lightweight and simple functionality. See [alpha-release github branch](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/tree/alpha-release) for more details.```$ pip install bardapi==0.1.23a```&lt;br&gt;## Authentication&gt; **Warning** Do not expose the `__Secure-1PSID` 1. Visit https://bard.google.com/2. F12 for console3. Session: Application → Cookies → Copy the value of  `__Secure-1PSID` cookie.Note that while I referred to `__Secure-1PSID` value as an API key for convenience, it is not an officially provided API key. Cookie value subject to frequent changes. Verify the value again if an error occurs. Most errors occur when an invalid cookie value is entered.&lt;br&gt;If you need to set multiple Cookie values- [Bard Cookies](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/README_DEV.md#bard-which-can-get-cookies) - After confirming that multiple cookie values are required to receive responses reliably in certain countries, I will deploy it for testing purposes. Please debug and create a pull request&lt;br&gt;## Usage [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zzzlTIh0kt2MdjLzvXRby1rWbHzmog8t?usp=sharing) Simple Usage```pythonfrom bardapi import Bardtoken = 'xxxxxxx'bard = Bard(token=token)bard.get_answer(&quot;나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘&quot;)['content']```Or you can use this```pythonfrom bardapi import Bardimport osos.environ['_BARD_API_KEY']=&quot;xxxxxxx&quot;Bard().get_answer(&quot;나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘&quot;)['content']```To get reponse dictionary```pythonimport bardapiimport os# set your __Secure-1PSID value to keytoken = 'xxxxxxx'# set your input textinput_text = &quot;나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘&quot;# Send an API request and get a response.response = bardapi.core.Bard(token).get_answer(input_text)```Addressing errors caused by delayed responses in environments like Google Colab and containers. If an error occurs despite following the proper procedure, utilize the timeout argument.```pythonfrom bardapi import Bardimport osos.environ['_BARD_API_KEY']=&quot;xxxxxxx&quot;bard = Bard(timeout=30) # Set timeout in secondsbard.get_answer(&quot;나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘&quot;)['content']```&lt;br&gt;## Further### Behind a proxyIf you are working behind a proxy, use the following.```pythonfrom bardapi import Bardimport os# Change 'http://proxy.example.com:8080' to your http proxy# timeout in secondsproxies = {    'http': 'http://proxy.example.com:8080',    'https': 'https://proxy.example.com:8080'}bard = Bard(token='xxxxxxx', proxies=proxies, timeout=30)bard.get_answer(&quot;나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘&quot;)['content']```### Reusable session objectYou can continue the conversation using a reusable session.```pythonfrom bardapi import Bardimport osimport requestsos.environ['_BARD_API_KEY'] = 'xxxxxxx'# token='xxxxxxx'session = requests.Session()session.headers = {            &quot;Host&quot;: &quot;bard.google.com&quot;,            &quot;X-Same-Domain&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,            &quot;User-Agent&quot;: &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.114 Safari/537.36&quot;,            &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8&quot;,            &quot;Origin&quot;: &quot;https://bard.google.com&quot;,            &quot;Referer&quot;: &quot;https://bard.google.com/&quot;,        }session.cookies.set(&quot;__Secure-1PSID&quot;, os.getenv(&quot;_BARD_API_KEY&quot;)) # session.cookies.set(&quot;__Secure-1PSID&quot;, token) bard = Bard(token=token, session=session, timeout=30)bard.get_answer(&quot;나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘&quot;)['content']# Continued conversation without set new sessionbard.get_answer(&quot;What is my last prompt??&quot;)['content']```&lt;br&gt;## Auto Cookie BardUsing [browser_cookie3](https://github.com/borisbabic/browser_cookie3) we extract the `__Secure-1PSID` cookie from all browsers, and then we can use the API without passing the token. However, there are still incomplete dependency packages and various variables, so please seek assistance in the following [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/borisbabic/browser_cookie3/issues) or adjust your browser's version.- Visit https://bard.google.com/ in your browser and execute the following command while in the chat-enabled state. Refer to browser_cookie3 for details on how it works. If any issues arise, please restart the browser or log in to your Google account again. *Recommended to keep the browser open.*```pythonfrom bardapi import Bardbard = Bard(token_from_browser=True)res = bard.get_answer(&quot;Do you like cookies?&quot;)print(res)```&lt;br&gt;## Bard `ask_about_image` method *It may not work as it is only available for certain accounts, regions, and other restrictions.*As an experimental feature, it is possible to ask questions with an image. However, this functionality is only available for accounts with image upload capability in Bard's web UI. ```pythonfrom bardapi import Bardbard = Bard(token='xxxxxxx')image = open('image.jpg', 'rb').read() # (jpeg, png, webp) are supported.bard_answer = bard.ask_about_image('What is in the image?', image)```&lt;br&gt;## [Text To Speech(TTS)](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech?hl=ko) from BardBusiness users and high traffic volume may be subject to account restrictions according to Google's policies. Please use the [Official Google Cloud API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) for any other purpose.
