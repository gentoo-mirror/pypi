Please raise an issue explaining whatis missing or if you find a bug. We will also gladly accept pull requestsagainst our master branch for new features or bug fixes.Development setup-----------------For Development we also recommend a ``conda`` environment. You can create oneincluding test dependencies and debugger by running``conda env create -f environment.yml``. This will create a new ``pynetcf``environment which you can activate by using ``source activate pynetcf``.Guidelines----------If you want to contribute please follow these steps:- Fork the pynetcf repository to your account- make a new feature branch from the pynetcf master branch- Add your feature- Please include tests for your contributions in one of the test directories.  We use py.test so a simple function called test_my_feature is enough- submit a pull request to our master branch.. _pyscaffold-notes:Note====This project has been set up using PyScaffold 4.2.3.
