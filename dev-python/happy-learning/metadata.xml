Installation:You can easily install Happy Learning via pip install happy_learning on every operating system.## 2. Requirements: - ...## 3. Introduction: - Practical Usage:It covers all aspects of the developing process, such as feature engineering, feature and model selection as well as hyper parameter optimization.- Feature Engineer:Process your tabular data smartly. The Feature Engineer module is equipped with all necessary (tabular) feature processing methods. Moreover, it is able to capture the metadata about the data set such as scaling measurement types of the features, taken processing steps, etc.To scale big data sets it generates temporary data files for each feature separately and loads them for processing purposes only. - Feature Learning: It combines both the feature engineering module and the genetic algorithm module to create a reinforcement learning environment to smartly generate new features.The module creates separate learning environments for categorical and continuous features. The categorical features are one-hot encoded and then unified (one-hot merging).Whereas the (semi-) continuous features are systematically processed by using several transformation and interaction methods. - Feature Tournament: Feature tournament is a process to evaluate the importance of each feature regarding to a specific target feature. It uses the concept of (Additive) Shapley Values to calculate the importance score.    -- Data Typing:        Check whether represented data types of Pandas is equal to the real data types occuring in the data- Feature Selector:The Feature Selector module applies the feature tournament to calculate feature importance scores and select automatically the best n features based on the scoring.- ModelGenerator:The ModelGenerator module generates supervised machine learning models and all necessary hyper parameters for structured (tabular) data.      -- Model / Hyper parameter:         Classification models ...            -&gt; Ada Boosting (ada)            -&gt; Cat Boost (cat)            -&gt; Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (gbo)            -&gt; K-Nearest Neighbor (knn)            -&gt; Linear Discriminant Analysis (lida)            -&gt; Logisitic Regression (log)            -&gt; Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (qda)            -&gt; Random Forest (rf)            -&gt; Support-Vector Machine (svm)            -&gt; Nu-Support-Vector Machine (nusvm)            -&gt; Extreme Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (xgb)         Regression models ...            -&gt; Ada Boosting (ada)            -&gt; Cat Boost (cat)            -&gt; Elastic Net (elastic)            -&gt; Generalized Additive Models (gam)            -&gt; Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (gbo)            -&gt; K-Nearest Neighbor (knn)            -&gt; Random Forest (rf)            -&gt; Support-Vector Machine (svm)            -&gt; Nu-Support-Vector Machine (nusvm)            -&gt; Extreme Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (xgb)- NetworkGenerator:The NetworkGenerator module generates neural network architectures and all necessary hyper parameters for text data using PyTorch.      -- Model / Hyper parameter:         -&gt; Attention Network (att)         -&gt; Gated Recurrent Unit (gru)         -&gt; Long-Short Term Memory (lstm)         -&gt; Multi-Layer Perceptron (mlp)         -&gt; Recurrent Neural Network (rnn)         -&gt; Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (rcnn)         -&gt; Self-Attention (self)         -&gt; Transformer (trans)- ClusteringGenerator:The ClusteringGenerator module generates unsupervised machine learning models and all necessary hyper parameters for text clustering.      -- Model / Hyper parameter:         -&gt; Gibbs-Sampling Dirichlet Multinomial Modeling (gsdmm)         -&gt; Latent Dirichlet Allocation (lda)         -&gt; Latent Semantic Indexing (lsi)         -&gt; Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (nmf)- GeneticAlgorithm:Reinforcement learning module either to evaluate the fittest model / hyper parameter configuration or to engineer (tabular) features.
