It can handle MPI applications, gather data from hundreds of nodes, and accumulate it efficiently. perun can be used as a command-line tool or as a function decorator in Python scripts.Check out the [docs](https://perun.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or a working [example](https://github.com/Helmholtz-AI-Energy/perun/blob/main/examples/torch_mnist/README.md)!## Key Features - Measures energy consumption of Python scripts using Intel RAPL, ROCM-SMI, Nvidia-NVML, and psutil - Capable of handling MPI application, gathering data from hundreds of nodes efficiently - Monitor individual functions using decorators - Tracks energy usage of the application over multiple executions - Easy to benchmark applications and functions## InstallationFrom PyPI:```consolepip install perun```&gt; Extra dependencies like nvidia-smi, rocm-smi and mpi can be installed through pip as well:```consolepip install perun[nvidia, rocm, mpi]```From Github:```consolepip install git+https://github.com/Helmholtz-AI-Energy/perun```## Quick Start### Command LineTo use perun as a command-line tool, run the monitor subcommand followed by the path to your Python script and its arguments:```console$ perun monitor path/to/your/script.py [args]```perun will output two files, and HDF5 style containing all the raw data that was gathered, and a text file with a summary of the results.```textPERUN REPORTApp name: finetune_qa_accelerateFirst run: 2023-08-15T18:56:11.202060Last run: 2023-08-17T13:29:29.969779RUN ID: 2023-08-17T13:29:29.969779|   Round # | Host                | RUNTIME   | ENERGY     | CPU_POWER   | CPU_UTIL   | GPU_POWER   | GPU_MEM    | DRAM_POWER   | MEM_UTIL   ||----------:|:--------------------|:----------|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|:-------------|:-----------||         0 | hkn0432.localdomain | 995.967 s | 960.506 kJ | 231.819 W   | 3.240 %    | 702.327 W   | 55.258 GB  | 29.315 W     | 0.062 %    ||         0 | hkn0436.localdomain | 994.847 s | 960.469 kJ | 235.162 W   | 3.239 %    | 701.588 W   | 56.934 GB  | 27.830 W     | 0.061 %    ||         0 | All                 | 995.967 s | 1.921 MJ   | 466.981 W   | 3.240 %    | 1.404 kW    | 112.192 GB | 57.145 W     | 0.061 %    |The application has been run 7 times. Throught its runtime, it has used 3.128 kWh, released a total of 1.307 kgCO2e into the atmosphere, and you paid 1.02 € in electricity for it.```Perun will keep track of the energy of your application over multiple runs.### Function MonitoringUsing a function decorator, information can be calculated about the runtime, power draw and component utilization while the function is executing.```pythonimport timefrom perun import monitor@monitor()def main(n: int):    time.sleep(n)```After running the script with ```perun monitor```, the text report will add information about the monitored functions.```textMonitored Functions|   Round # | Function                    |   Avg Calls / Rank | Avg Runtime     | Avg Power        | Avg CPU Util   | Avg GPU Mem Util   ||----------:|:----------------------------|-------------------:|:----------------|:-----------------|:---------------|:-------------------||         0 | main                        |                  1 | 993.323±0.587 s | 964.732±0.499 W  | 3.244±0.003 %  | 35.091±0.526 %     ||         0 | prepare_train_features      |                 88 | 0.383±0.048 s   | 262.305±19.251 W | 4.541±0.320 %  | 3.937±0.013 %      ||         0 | prepare_validation_features |                 11 | 0.372±0.079 s   | 272.161±19.404 W | 4.524±0.225 %  | 4.490±0.907 %      |```### MPIPerun is compatible with MPI applications that make use of ```mpi4py```, and requires changes in the code or in the perun configuration. Simply replace the ```python``` command with ```perun monitor```.```consolempirun -n 8 perun monitor path/to/your/script.py```## DocsTo get more information, check out our [docs page](https://perun.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).## Citing perunIf you found perun usefull, please consider citing the conference paper: * Gutiérrez Hermosillo Muriedas, J.P., Flügel, K., Debus, C., Obermaier, H., Streit, A., Götz, M.: perun: Benchmarking Energy Consumption of High-Performance Computing Applications.

The amount of power required to operate such massive computing machines has been steadily increasing, earning HPC users a higher than usual carbon footprint. While the problem is well known in academia, the exact energy requirements of hardware, software and how to optimize it are hard to quantify. To tackle this issue, we need tools to understand the software and its relationship with power consumption in today's high performance computers. With that in mind, we present perun, a Python package and command line interface to measure energy consumption based on hardware performance counters and selected physical measurement sensors. This enables accurate energy measurements on various scales of computing, from a single laptop to an MPI-distributed HPC application. We include an analysis of the discrepancies between these sensor readings and hardware performance counters, with particular focus on the power draw of the usually overlooked non-compute components such as memory. One of our major insights is their significant share of the total energy consumption. We have equally analyzed the runtime and energy overhead perun generates when monitoring common HPC applications, and found it to be minimal. Finally, an analysis on the accuracy of different measuring methodologies when applied at large scales is presented.&quot;,  isbn=&quot;978-3-031-39698-4&quot;}```</longdescription>
