	<longdescription>Contributing to the AutoRoute Project=====================================Introduction------------Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AutoRoute project!Our goal is to simplify and automate the creation of SaaS/PaaSsolutions. We’re excited to welcome you to our community.Here’s a guide on how you can contribute:Getting Started---------------**Understanding the Project:** Familiarize yourself with the project’sfeatures, design philosophy, and architecture. Spend some time exploringthe codebase and reading the existing documentation (md and docstrings).-  `Components_Breakdown.md &lt;Components_Breakdown.md&gt;`__-  `Proposal.md &lt;Proposal.md&gt;`__-  `Part 1 - Creating FastAPI Application and Auto-generating Class   Method   Endpoints.md &lt;1%20-%20Creating%20FastAPI%20Application%20and%20Auto-generating%20Class%20Method%20Endpoints.md&gt;`__-  `Part 2 - Generating OpenAPI Specification and Interactive   Documentation for   FastAPI.md &lt;2%20-%20Generating%20OpenAPI%20Specification%20and%20Interactive%20Documentation%20for%20FastAPI.md&gt;`__-  `Part 3 - Exploring the Generated Python Client Library and   Customizing Its   Configuration.md &lt;3%20-%20Exploring%20the%20Generated%20Python%20Client%20Library%20and%20Customizing%20Its%20Configuration.md&gt;`__-  `Part 4 - FastAPI Application and Generated Client Library: Complete   Guide for   Beginners.md &lt;4%20-%20FastAPI%20Application%20and%20Generated%20Client%20Library%3A%20Complete%20Guide%20for%20Beginners.md&gt;`__-  `Dockerfile_example.md &lt;Dockerfile_example.md&gt;`__-  `how_to_improve_microservice.md &lt;how_to_improve_microservice.md&gt;`__**Quick and Incomplete Guide:**1.  *@auto_route:*    1. The **naming conversion** for functions using this wrapper is       ``http-method_tag_*detail`` :       1. *where* http_method is in          ``[get, post, put, delete, patch, options, head, trace]``       2. the **tag** is the name of the class that the function is in,          e.g. ``customer``       3. the **detail** is the name of the function, in the example          above, the detail would be ``id``       4. e.g.  ## Areas of Contribution    ::       api = APIAutoRouter()        class User(BaseModel):            id: int            name: str        @api.register()        class User_Controller:            @api.route()            def get_user_by_id(id: int):                return {&quot;id&quot;: id, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;User&quot;}            @api.route()            def post_user_by_id(user: User):                return {&quot;id&quot;: user.id, &quot;name&quot;: user.name}            @api.route()            def delete_user_by_id(id: int):                return {&quot;id_deleted&quot;: id}2.  *@auto_app:*    1. **Easy Integration**    ::        # Also includes AutoApp class for auto-generating FastAPI applications        from auto_app import APIAutoApp        APIAutoApp(routers_list=[api.router]).run(host='localhost', port=8000)    1. **Flexible**    ::        stripe_router_config = AutoLoadRouterConfigObject(            module_path='Stripe/stripe_class.py',            router_names=['stripe_router'],            init_classes=[                InitClassObject(class_name='Customer'),                InitClassObject(class_name='Payment_Intent'),                InitClassObject(class_name='Subscriptions'),            ]        )        api_auto_app = APIAutoApp(routers_list=[stripe_router_config])        # Can accept any FastAPI app including custom ones        app = api_auto_app.build_app() # This is done under the hood if app obj not passed, here done explicitly for clarity        api_auto_app.run(host='localhost', port=8000, app=app)2.  **Documentation:** Clear, comprehensive documentation is crucial for    any successful open-source project. Help us improve our    documentation by creating tutorials, adding usage examples, and    improving descriptions of features and configurations.3.  **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** We’re    always aiming to improve our automated testing and deployment    processes. If you have experience with CI/CD platforms like GitHub    Actions, Travis CI, or Jenkins, your expertise could be incredibly    valuable.4.  **Automated Testing:** Robust testing is a core part of our    commitment to code quality. Help us achieve this by writing unit    tests and improving our code coverage.5.  **Code Quality Checks:** We’re committed to maintaining a clean and    readable codebase. Contribute by improving our linting processes,    static code analysis, and enforcing our code style guidelines.6.  **Debugging Pipelines:** This is an exciting part of our project. If    you have ideas on how to include more common issues and security    checks, or ways to extend our debugging with user-defined checks, we    would love to hear from you.7.  **Payment Integrations:** We currently support Stripe, but we aim to    provide more flexibility for our users. Help us integrate other    payment providers like PayPal, Square, or even cryptocurrencies.8.  **Configuration Options:** We want to make our project as flexible    as possible. Your contributions could help us support different    deployment options, database backends, and more.9.  **API Wrappers:** We currently provide wrappers for Google    applications. Help us extend our reach by adding wrappers for other    popular APIs, such as social media APIs or other cloud service APIs.10. **Multi-Language Support:** We already support over 50 languages    thanks to openapi.json and the OpenAPI SDK generator. Help us extend    our reach by translating our documentation or other parts of our    project into other languages.Community---------Finally, we encourage all contributors to participate in our community.Join our forum or chat room, sign up for our mailing list, and help usbuild a friendly, active community around our project.Thank you for considering contributing to AutoRoute. We look forward toworking with you!</longdescription>
