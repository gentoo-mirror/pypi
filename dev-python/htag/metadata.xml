Many examples from simpler to complex ones, in tutorial spirit. * [pyscript/demo](https://raw.githack.com/manatlan/htag/main/examples/pyscript_demo.html): A htag app in a simple html page, running with [pyscript runner](https://manatlan.github.io/htag/runners/#pyscript). Many examples in a REPL mode (you can try/edit/run them). (ONLY HTML needed)## ROADMAP to 1.0.0 * the &quot;0.60.x&quot; is the pre-version before 1.0.0 (htag core will not change anymore). I need to fix some runners before. * tests tests * setup minimal docs, with [that](https://realpython.com/python-project-documentation-with-mkdocs/) ;-) * ~~top level api could change (Tag() -&gt; create a Tag, Tag.mytag() -&gt; create a TagBase ... can be a little bit ambiguous)~~ * ~~manage &quot;query params&quot; from url to initialize Tags/routes~~ * ~~I don't really like the current way to generate js in interaction : need to found something more solid.~~ * ~~the current way to initiate the statics is odd (only on real (embedded) Tag's) : should find a better way (static like gtag ?!)~~and more technicals :- ~~better js try/catch to sort js/py error + try/catch on http com error (for thoses which kill session webhttp/pye) ~~- ~~getStateImage is non sense coz it's str'ing (why not returning the str ?!)~~- ~~mix the Tag.__init__ with the old system (like this: it's unmaintable)~~- ~~introduce a virtual tag/placeholder~~- DISPLAY a warning (or exception in STRICT_MODE), when a render method use a &quot;tag creation&quot; (ex: Tag.div(&quot;hello&quot;)), because it will always be rendered !!!!! -&gt; bad habits- ~~rename &quot;tag&quot; to &quot;self&quot; for js statements (keep the twos, for compatibility reasons)~~- ~~Make it possibles -&gt; NOT POSSIBLE currently ... abandonned ;-)~~    ~~self.js = self.bind( self.starting , b'window.innerWidth') # doesn't work currently~~    ~~self.js = self.bind.starting( b'window.innerWidth' ) # work (only reason to keep the &quot;old form&quot;)~~- ~~perhaps `self( js_statement)` -&gt; `self.call( js_statement )` ... less confusing !~~- ~~thus, to avoid `self( self.bind.method(*a,**k) )`, you can write `self.call.&lt;method&gt;( *a,**k )`~~## HistoryAt the beginning, there was [guy](https://github.com/manatlan/guy), which was/is the same concept as [python-eel](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel), but more advanced.One day, I've discovered [remi](https://github.com/rawpython/remi), and asked my self, if it could be done in a *guy way*. The POC was very good, so I releaseda version of it, named [gtag](https://github.com/manatlan/gtag). It worked well despite some drawbacks, but was too difficult to maintain. So I decided to rewrite allfrom scratch, while staying away from *guy* (to separate, *rendering* and *runners*)... and [htag](https://github.com/manatlan/htag) was born. The codebase is very short, concepts are better implemented, and it's very easy to maintain.</longdescription>
