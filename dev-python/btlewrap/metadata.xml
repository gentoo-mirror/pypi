	<longdescription>btlewrap========Bluetooth LowEnergy wrapper for different python backends. This gives you a nice API so that you can use different Bluetooth implementations on different platforms.This library was initially implemented as part of the `miflora &lt;https://github.com/open-homeautomation/miflora&gt;`_ library, but then refactored out, so that it can be used on other projects as well.contribution============.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/ChristianKuehnel/btlewrap.svg?branch=master    :target: https://travis-ci.org/ChristianKuehnel/btlewrap.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/ChristianKuehnel/btlewrap/badge.svg?branch=master    :target: https://coveralls.io/github/ChristianKuehnel/btlewrap?branch=masterBackends========As there is unfortunately no universally working Bluetooth Low Energy library for Python, the project currently offers support for three Bluetooth implementations:* bluepy library (recommended library)* bluez tools (via a wrapper around gatttool)* pygatt for Bluegiga BLED112-based devicesbluepy------To use the `bluepy &lt;https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy&gt;`_ library you have to install it on your machine, in most cases this can be done via: ::     pip3 install bluepy    This is the recommended backend to be used. In comparision to the gatttool wrapper, it is much faster in getting the data and also more stable.        bluez/gatttool wrapper----------------------To use the bluez wrapper, you need to install the bluez tools on your machine. No additional python libraries are required. Some distrubutions moved the gatttool binary to a separate package. Make sure you have this binaray available on your machine.pygatt------If you have a Blue Giga based device that is supported by `pygatt &lt;https://github.com/peplin/pygatt&gt;`_, you have toinstall the bluepy library on your machine. In most cases this can be done via: ::    pip3 install pygattUsage=====See the depending projects below on how to use the library.Depending projects==================These projects are using btlewrap:* `miflora &lt;https://github.com/open-homeautomation/miflora&gt;`_* `mitemp &lt;https://github.com/flavio20002/mitemp_bt&gt;`_</longdescription>
