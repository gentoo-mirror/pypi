	<longdescription>There are millions of templating systems out there (most of themdeveloped for the web). This isn't one of those, though it does sharesome basics: a markup syntax for templates that are processed to giveresultant text output.  The main difference with `preprocess.py` isthat its syntax is hidden in comments (whatever the syntax for commentsmaybe in the target filetype) so that the file can still have validsyntax. A comparison with the C preprocessor is more apt.`preprocess.py` is targetted at build systems that deal with manytypes of files. Languages for which it works include: C++, Python,Perl, Tcl, XML, JavaScript, CSS, IDL, TeX, Fortran, PHP, Java, Shellscripts (Bash, CSH, etc.) and C#. Preprocess is usable both as acommand line app and as a Python module.</longdescription>
