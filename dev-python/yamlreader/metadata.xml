With adirectory, the YAML files (`*.yaml`) are sorted alphabetically. The YAMLfiles are expected to contain a complex key-value structure and mergedwith the following rules:* lists get appended* hashes get merged by key* scalars (numbers, strings) are overwritten* everything else will failThe purpose is to allow several YAML files instead of a single YAML file. Weuse it to help our software read configuration data from an arbitrary amountof YAML files instead of a single YAML file.Read the unit test to see some examples.Building and Installation=========================Using pip---------**yamlreader** is available with ``pip``:::    pip install yamlreaderManual build and installation-----------------------------If you want to make changes or use e.g. ``fpm`` for packaging this, you need toprepare the development environment to make further steps.Prepare the source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~::    git clone https://github.com/ImmobilienScout24/yamlreader.git    cd yamlreader    virtualenv venv    source venv/bin/activate    pip install pybuilder    pyb install_dependenciesRunning tests~~~~~~~~~~~~~::    pyb verifyGenerating a setup.py~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~::    pyb    cd target/dist/yamlreader-&lt;VERSION&gt;    ./setup.py &lt;whatever you want&gt;Running=======The package installs a command line script ``yamlreader`` that can be used toread one or many YAML files and dump the merge result as a YAML document.Use it in your software=======================Wherever you had been using the ``safe_load`` function of`PyYAML &lt;http://pyyaml.org/&gt;`_ to read a single YAML file you can usethe ``yamlreader.yaml_load`` function as a replacement to read all ``*.yaml``files in a directory::    from yamlreader import yaml_load    defaultconfig = {            &quot;loglevel&quot; : &quot;error&quot;,            &quot;some&quot; : &quot;value&quot;    }    config = yaml_load(&quot;/etc/myapp&quot;, defaultconfig)yaml_load---------::    def yaml_load(source,defaultdata=None):        &quot;&quot;&quot;merge YAML data from files found in source        Always returns a dict. The YAML files are expected to contain some kind of        key:value structures, possibly deeply nested. When merging, lists are        appended and dict keys are replaced. The YAML files are read with the        yaml.safe_load function.        source can be a file, a dir, a list/tuple of files or a string containing        a glob expression (with ?*[]).        For a dir all *.yaml files will be read in alphabetical order.        defaultdata can be used to initialize the data.        &quot;&quot;&quot;</longdescription>
