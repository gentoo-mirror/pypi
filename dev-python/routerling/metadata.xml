	<longdescription># Routerling : &lt;img src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-95%25-green&quot; /&gt;Routerling is a very very small, extremely tiny, and insanely fast [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io) web application framework. It was designed to facilitate productivity by allowing for complete mastery in 7 minutes or less.Routerling is a very light layer around ASGI with support for application mounting and is perhaps the simplest and one of the fastest python web frameworks (biased opinion of course).## InstalllingInstall with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/)```sh$ pip install routerling```## A Simple Example&lt;hr/&gt;```pyfrom routerling import Routerasync def index(req, res, ctx):    res.body = 'Hello, World!'router = Router()router.GET('/', index)```You can run with uvicorn, gunicorn or any other asgi HTTP, HTTP2, and web socket protocol server of your choice.```sh$ uvicorn main:router --reload * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000```## ContributingFor guidance on how to make contributions to Routerling, see the [Contribution Guidelines](contributions.md)## Links- Documentation [Go To Docs](https://rayattack.github.io/routerling)- PyPi [https://pypi.org/project/routerling](https://pypi.org/project/routerling)- Source Code [Github](https://github.com/rayattack/routerling)</longdescription>
