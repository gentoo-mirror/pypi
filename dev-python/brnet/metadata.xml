	<longdescription># brnetThese is a networking tool to make running emulated systems under Linuxa little easier and more secure.I have been using simh and klh10 a lot recently to emulate old computersand operating systems.  Networking has been a particular pain becausemost of these systems require raw access to the network devices, andthat typically means running the as root.I didn't want to do that.  So I wrote brnet.What this script does is to take the interface you specify (defaultingto eth0) and turn it into a bridge device.  The using a user and groupyou specify (it defaults to pi/adm, which is correct for a PiDP-11), itcreates a number of tap interfaces (defaulting to 4), and connects themto the bridge too.The point of doing that is so that you can run brnet with rootprivileges to create network devices that another user can own and havefull control of without requiring escalated privileges.After running brnet, you can therefore use, say, the `tap0` interface ina guest system as your emulated ethernet device, and run as your normalemulator user without sudo, and still have the network interface work.# Installing`pip install brnet`, or check out the repository and do a `pip install-e .`  You probably want to do this in a virtualenv, and if you do that,you probably want to install a wrapper script as `/usr/local/bin/brnet`to activate the appropriate virtualenv and then run the `brnet` command(virtualenv activation will put the new stuff at the head of your`$PATH`).  One approach to this is [here](./wrapper.sh).Then you want to drop the following into `/etc/network/interfaces.d` tostart the network after the physical interface comes up.  I called myfile [`01-phys-to-bridge`](./01-phys-to-bridge).# ExamplesTo run using the defaults, which should work for a Raspberry Pi runningthe PiDP-11 software: `brnet start`.To run with a different user and group and more tap devices:`brnet -u adam -g wheel -n 8 start`To shut down the bridge and put things back the way they were:`brnet stop``brnet -h` will give you a help message explaining all the parameters.</longdescription>
