	<longdescription># Sphinx Domain for Modern CMakeThis is taken directly from the Kitware git repository's Utilities directory.The original [sphinxcontrib-cmakedomain][] has not been touched in quite some andas a result it was wildly out of date. Documenting CMake domain entities inprojects is painful otherwise. This works *exactly* in the same way as Kitware,so some time might be needed to study their approach to these problems.This repository is under the same License as all of CMake, which is theBSD-3-Clause license.ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨Any issues you run into with this plugin must be reported to [Kitware][]ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨# Installation## PyPIThis domain is available via PyPI. Install it directly via `pip`:```$ pip install sphinxcontrib-moderncmakedomain```Alternatively, place it inside of your `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`,`requirements.txt` or whatever system it is that you use to declare and manageyour dependencies. A new version will usually only be released if there is achange to this extension inside CMake.## GitThis module is installable via `pip` and GitHub directly as well```$ pip install git+https://github.com/scikit-build/moderncmakedomain.git```# UsageTo enable the use of the `moderncmakedomain`, add`sphinxcontrib.moderncmakedomain` to the `extensions` variable of your`conf.py` file:```pythonextensions = [..., 'sphinxcontrib.moderncmakedomain', ...]```The plugin currently provides several directives and references. These aredocumented below.## Directives|     directive      |                      description                    ||:------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------|| `cmake:variable::` | For a basic variable                                || `cmake:command::`  | For a function                                      || `cmake-module::`   | Autodoc style extractor (takes a relative filepath) || `cmake:envvar::`   | For environment variables                           |To declare any of the references found below, they must be placed into adirectory with the same name under the sphinx SOURCEDIR/master doc. Thus,`prop_tgt/MY_PERSONAL_PROPERTY.rst` can be referred to with``:prop_tgt:`MY_PERSONAL_PROPERTY` ``. This is currently the *only* way CMakepermits declaring new properties.## ReferencesEach reference below can be placed into a directory with the same name todocument custom extensions provided by your CMake libraries.|      ref       |                   description                      ||:--------------:|:---------------------------------------------------|| `:variable:`   | Refer to a CMake variable                          || `:command:`    | Refer to a CMake command                           || `:envvar:`     | Refers to an environment variable                  || `:cpack_gen:`  | Refers to CPack generators                         || `:generator:`  | Refers to a build file generator                   || `:genex:`      | Refers to a generator expression                   || `:guide:`      | Used to refer to a &quot;guide&quot; page                    || `:manual:`     | Used to refer to a &quot;manual&quot; page (like `cmake(1)`) || `:policy:`     | Refers to CMake Policies                           || `:module:`     | Refers to CMake Modules                            || `:prop_tgt:`   | For target properties                              || `:prop_test:`  | For test properties                                || `:prop_sf:`    | For source file properties                         || `:prop_gbl:`   | For global properties                              || `:prop_dir:`   | For directory properties                           || `:prop_inst:`  | For installed file properties                      || `:prop_cache:` | For cache properties                               |# History`sphinx-moderncmakedomain` was initially developed in October 2018 by[slurps-mad-rips][slurps-mad-rips] to  help write CMake documentation by simplypublishing a python package of the same. This was a critical step to  ease themaintenance of sphinx-based documentation and avoid systematically copying theassociated python  module maintained within the CMake repository.Later in early August 2021, [henryiii][henryiii] discovered the`sphinx-moderncmakedomain` project  while working on scikit-build issue[#574][skbuild-issue-574] intended to simplify its documentation generationinfrastructure and avoid updating its own copy of the sphinx extension.[henryiii][henryiii] and [jcfr][jcfr] then worked with[slurps-mad-rips][slurps-mad-rips] to establish a transition plan tocollaboratively maintain the project within the scikit-build organization.[sphinxcontrib-cmakedomain]: https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/cmakedomain[Kitware]: https://gitlab.kitware.com/[skbuild-issue-574]: https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/574[slurps-mad-rips]: https://github.com/slurps-mad-rips[henryiii]: https://github.com/henryiii[jcfr]: https://github.com/jcfr</longdescription>
