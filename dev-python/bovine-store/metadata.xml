	<longdescription># bovine_store`bovine_store` is meant to be the module handling storing oflocal ActivityPub objects and caching of remote ActivityPubobjects.## Usagebovine_store assumes that a database connection is initialized using [tortoise-orm](https://tortoise.github.io/). See `examples/basic_app.py` for how to do this in the context of a quart app.## TODO- [ ] When properties of actor are updated, send an update Activity  - Doesn't fit into the current bovine framework ... bovine_store doesn't know how to send activities- [ ] Generally rework the actor properties mechanism. It is currently not possible to emulate say Mastodon featured collection with it.- [ ] bovine_store.models.BovineActorKeyPair needs renamings; and work, e.g. a future identity column should have a uniqueness constraint.- [ ] Generally the code quality is not as high as it should be.## ExamplesA demonstration webserver can be seen using```bashpoetry run python examples/basic_app.py```Note this is a very basic example. Instructions what the example does areprinted to the command line after start.Note: This example creates two files `db.sqlite3`, which contains thedatabase and `context_cache.sqlite`, which contains the cache of json-ldcontexts.</longdescription>
