	<longdescription>All platforms have good support for 2D images, with well-recognized formatssuch as PNG and JPEG that can be viewed out of the box (no installation)and shared trivially.However, while many formats exist for 3D data, none are well-supportedwithout installation of tools such as MeshLab, Blender, etc.ScenePic was created for 3D computer vision researchers such as thoseworking on [HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/hololens)and [Mesh](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mesh) at Microsoft.It was designed to be a lightweight, reuseable 3D visualizationlibrary, with the following desiderata in mind:- Make experimentation with 3D data near effortless- Incredibly easy to create and share 3D results  * zero-install sharing of detailed 3D results using HTML  * based on modern web standards so usable with any modern browser    (tested in Edge, FireFox and Chrome)  * embeddable in other HTML documents- Performant  * based on WebGL- High quality visuals- Works both offline or interactively in client-server setup- Simple, clean API  * friendly Python front-end  * basic mesh json file format  * other language front ends easy to add</longdescription>
