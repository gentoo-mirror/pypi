However,instead of using a single cryptographic hash function to identify data only, the ISCC uses variousalgorithms to create a composite identifier that exhibits similarity-preserving properties (softhash).The component-based structure of the ISCC identifies content at multiple levels of abstraction. Eachcomponent is self-describing, modular, and can be used separately or with others to aid in variouscontent identification tasks. The algorithmic design supports content deduplication, databasesynchronization, indexing, integrity verification, timestamping, versioning, data provenance,similarity clustering, anomaly detection, usage tracking, allocation of royalties, fact-checking andgeneral digital asset management use-cases.## What is `iscc-sdk``iscc-sdk` is built on top of `iscc-core` and adds high level features for generating and handlingISCC codes for all the different mediatypes:- mediatype detection- metadata extraction and embedding- mediatype specific content extraction and pre-processing- iscc indexing and search## RequirementsPython 3.8 to 3.11 on 64-bit systems## InstallationUse the Python package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install `iscc-sdk`.```bashpip install iscc-sdk```## Getting StartedCreate an ISCC-CODE for a media file:```pythonimport iscc_sdk as idkprint(idk.code_iscc(&quot;/path/to/mediafile.jpg&quot;))```Using the CLI tool to create an ISCC-CODE```shellidk create /path/to/mediafile.jpg```Batch creation of ISCC-CODEs```shellidk batch /folder_with_media_files```## Documentation&lt;https://sdk.iscc.codes&gt;## TroubleshootingOn Linux and MacOS you might need to install taglib as a prerequisite. On Ubuntu, Mint and otherDebian-Based distributions do:```shellsudo apt install libtag1-dev```On a Mac, use HomeBrew:```shellbrew install taglib```## Project StatusThe ISCC has been accepted by ISO as full work item ISO/AWI 24138 - International Standard ContentCode and is currently being standardized at TC 46/SC 9/WG 18.https://www.iso.org/standard/77899.html!!! attention    The `iscc-sdk` library and the accompanying documentation is under development. API changes and    other backward incompatible changes are to be expected until the upcoming v1.5 stable release.## Maintainers[@titusz](https://github.com/titusz)## ContributingPull requests are welcome. For significant changes, please open an issue first to discuss yourplans. Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.You may also want join our developer chat on Telegram at &lt;https://t.me/iscc_dev&gt;.</longdescription>
