	<longdescription>PyLogBeat=========[![CI Tests](https://github.com/eht16/pylogbeat/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/eht16/pylogbeat/actions/workflows/tests.yml)[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pylogbeat.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pylogbeat/)[![Python Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pylogbeat.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pylogbeat/)[![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/pylogbeat.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pylogbeat/)PyLogBeat is a simple, incomplete implementation of the Beats protocolused by Elastic Beats and Logstash. For more information about Beats seehttps://www.elastic.co/products/beats andhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-inputs-beats.html.With this library it is possible to send log messages or any data toLogstash' beats input plugin or any other service which implementsthe Beats protocol.The main difference to other transport mechanisms like direct TCPor UDP transfer is that with the Beats protocol there is a higherreliability of the data transfer, especially since the serveracknowledges the data it received so the client knows whether andwhat to resend.Installation------------The easiest method is to install directly from pypi using pip:    pip install pylogbeatIf you prefer, you can download PyLogBeat fromhttps://github.com/eht16/pylogbeat and install it directly from source:    python setup.py installDue to a bug (&lt;https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/pull/342&gt;)in some Logstash versions, you will need Logstash &gt;= 5.6.12 or Logstash &gt;= 6.4.0.Get the Source--------------The source code is available at https://github.com/eht16/pylogbeat/.Usage-----### Simple use```python    message = {'@timestamp': '2018-01-02T01:02:03',  '@version': '1', 'message': 'hello world'}    client = PyLogBeatClient('localhost', 5959, ssl_enable=False)    client.connect()    client.send([message])    client.close()```### Using a context manager```python    with PyLogBeatClient('localhost', 5959, ssl_enable=False) as client:        client.send([message])```### Using a SSL connection```python    with PyLogBeatClient('localhost', 5959, ssl_enable=True, ssl_verify=True,            keyfile='certificate.key', certfile='certificate.crt', ca_certs='ca.crt') as client:        client.send([message])```For details regarding the SSL certificates and how to configure theLogstash input for SSL, seehttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-inputs-beats.html.Message Format--------------`PyLogBeatClient.send()` accepts a sequence (list, tuple, set) of &quot;messages&quot;.The messages itself can either be a `dict` object representing the finalmessage to be sent to Logstash or a `bytes` or `string` object which mustcontain properly formatted `JSON`.If a `dict` is passed as element, it is converted to `JSON` using`json.dumps()`.### Example messageThe following example is a message as `JSON`:```python    {        &quot;@timestamp&quot;: &quot;2018-01-02T01:02:03&quot;,        &quot;@version&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,        &quot;extra&quot;: {            &quot;application&quot;: &quot;django_example&quot;,            &quot;django_version&quot;: &quot;2.1.0&quot;,            &quot;environment&quot;: &quot;production&quot;        },        &quot;host&quot;: &quot;my-local-host&quot;,        &quot;level&quot;: &quot;INFO&quot;,        &quot;logsource&quot;: &quot;my-local-host&quot;,        &quot;message&quot;: &quot;foo bar&quot;,        &quot;pid&quot;: 65534,        &quot;program&quot;: &quot;example.py&quot;,        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;python-logstash&quot;    }```This is the standard Logstash message format in JSON.Logging-------PyLogBeat uses a logger named &quot;pylogbeat&quot; to log some debug messagesand warnings in case of errors. By default, the logger's log levelis set to `Warning` so you will not see any debug log messages.If necessary simply change the log level of the logger to see the debugmessages. For example:```python    import logging    logging.getLogger('pylogbeat').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)```It is important to make this change *after* you importedthe `pylogbeat` module.Furthermore, PyLogBeatClient's constructor method takes a `use_logging`argument which should be a boolean indicating whether the loggingsubsystem should be used at all. The argument defaults to `False`,i.e. if you want any logging, you need to pass `True`.If PyLogBeat is used itself as part of the logging system (e.g.as the transport of a handler), it is important to not emit any newlog messages once the logging subsystem has been shutdown or is in theprocess of shutting down. In this case, `use_logging` must be `False`in order to suppress generating log messages.Protocol Support----------------The implemented Beats protocol is not yet officially specified anddocumented, unfortunately. Hopefully the Beats developers willprovide a specification in the future.So far, sending the data and waiting for the ACK from the server isimplemented. But there might some details from the protocol missingin the implementation.Future Maintenance------------------If you are interested in the code, want to improve it and/orcomplete the protocol support, please feel free to send PRs.I would be happy if someone likes to continue developing this libraryand would also take full maintainership for future development andreleases.Contributing------------Found a bug or got a feature request? Please report it athttps://github.com/eht16/pylogbeat/issues.Credits-------This code is based on https://github.com/brxie/PyLumberjack andadopted to support version 2 of the protocol.Thanks to brxie for the initial code.ChangeLog---------### 2.0.1 / 2023-07-30- Load certificate chain only if a certificate was specified### 2.0.0 / 2020-10-04- Remove &quot;six&quot; dependency- Require Python &gt;= 3.6### 1.0.5 / 2020-10-04- Set `python_requires` to Python &gt;=2.7 or Python &gt;= 3.6 for  smooth upgrade to upcoming Python3 only.  This way Python2 only users will stay at this release.### 1.0.4 / 2020-05-06- Validate input data and fix documentation about accepted values (#2)### 1.0.3 / 2020-04-22- Add note about required Logstash versions (#1)- Improve unit tests### 1.0.2 / 2018-12-31- Add badges to README### 1.0.1 / 2018-12-31- Fix typo in setup.py- Use distribution &quot;trusty&quot; for Travis builds### 1.0.0 / 2018-12-31- Initial releaseLicense-------PyLogBeat is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.Author------Enrico Tr√∂ger &lt;enrico.troeger@uvena.de&gt;</longdescription>
