	<longdescription>üèÅ  impall: automatically import all Python modules for testing   üèÅIndividually and separately imports each Python module or file in a project andreports warnings or failures at the end.### Running impall as a unit testJust inherit from the base class and it willautomatically find and import each file, like this.    import impall    class ImpAllTest(impall.ImpAllTest):        pass(You can copy [this file](https://github.com/rec/impall/blob/master/all_test.py)into your project if you like.)Tests are customized by overriding one of these following properties in thederived class.    CLEAR_SYS_MODULES, EXCLUDE, FAILING, INCLUDE, MODULES, PATHS,    RAISE_EXCEPTIONS, and WARNINGS_ACTION.For example, to turn warnings into errors, set the propertyWARNINGS_ACTION in the derived class definition, like this.    class ImpAllTest(impall.ImpAllTest):        WARNINGS_ACTION = 'error'## Running impall as a command-line utility    $ impall.py --warnings_action=error    $ impall.py -w errorThe properties INCLUDE, EXCLUDE, and PROJECT_PATH can belists of strings, or a string separated with colons like'foo.mod1:foo.mod2'INCLUDE and EXCLUDE match modules, and also allow * as a wildcard.A single * matches any module segment, and a double ** matches anyremaining segments. For example,INCLUDE = 'foo', 'bar.*', 'baz.**'* matches `foo` but not `foo.foo`* matches `bar.foo` but not `bar` or `bar.foo.bar`* matches `baz.foo` as well as `baz.foo.bar` but not `baz`### A note on side-effectsto reduce side-effects, `sys.modules` is restored to its originalcondition after each import if CLEAR_SYS_MODULES is true, but there might beother side-effects from loading some specific module.Use the EXCLUDE property to exclude modules with undesirable sideeffects. In general, it is probably a bad idea to have significantside-effects just from loading a module.### [API Documentation](https://rec.github.io/impall#impall--api-documentation)</longdescription>
