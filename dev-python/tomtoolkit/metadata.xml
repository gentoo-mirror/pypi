TOMs are meant to facilitate collaborative astronomical observingprojects. A typical TOM allows its users to curate target lists, requestobservations of those targets at various observatories as well as manage andorganize their data. [Read more](https://tom-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/about.html) about TOMs.## Getting started with the TOM ToolkitThe [getting started guide](https://tom-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/getting_started.html)will guide you through the process of setting up a TOM for the first time.## Reporting issues/feature requestsPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_base/issues) toreport any issues or support questions.## Contributing to the projectIf you'd like to contribute to the TOM Toolkit, first of all, thanks! Secondly, wehave a [contribution guide](https://tom-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/contributing.html) thatyou might find helpful. We are particularly interested in the contribution ofobservation and alert modules.## Developer informationFor development information targeted at the maintainers of the project, please see [README-dev.md](README-dev.md).## Plugins### tom_alerts_dashThe [tom_alerts_dash](https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_alerts_dash) plugin adds responsive ReactJS views to the`tom_alerts` module for supported brokers.### AntaresThe [tom-antares](https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_antares) plugin adds supportfor querying the Antares broker for targets of interest.### tom_nonsidereal_airmassThe [tom_nonsidereal_airmass](https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_nonsidereal_airmass) plugin provides a templatetagthat supports plotting for non-sidereal objects. The plugin is fully supported by the TOM Toolkit team; however,non-sidereal visibility calculations require the PyEphem library, which is minimally supported while its successoris in development. The library used for the TOM Toolkit sidereal visibility, astroplan, does not yet supportnon-sidereal visibility calculations.### tom-ltThis module provides the ability to submit observations to the Liverpool Telescope Phase 2 system. It is in a very alphastate, with little error handling and minimal instrument options, but can successfully submit well-formed observationrequests.[Github](https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_lt)### tom_registrationThe [tom_registration](https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_registration) plugin introduces support for two TOM registrationflows--an open registration, and a registration that requires administrator approval.</longdescription>
