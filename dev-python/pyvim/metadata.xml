	<longdescription>pyvim=====*An implementation of Vim in Python*::    pip install pyvim.. image :: https://github.com/jonathanslenders/pyvim/raw/master/docs/images/welcome-screen.pngIssues, questions, wishes, comments, feedback, remarks? Please create a GitHubissue, I appreciate it.|Build Status|Installation------------Simply install ``pyvim`` using pip:::    pip install pyvimIt is a good idea to add the following to your ``~/.bashrc`` if you reallywant to use it:::    alias vi=pyvim    export EDITOR=pyvimThe good things---------------The editor is written completely in Python. (There are no C extensions). Thismakes development a lot faster. It's easy to prototype and integrate newfeatures.We have already many nice things, for instance:- Syntax highlighting of files, using the Pygments lexers.- Horizontal and vertical splits, as well as tab pages. (Similar to Vim.)- All of the functionality of `prompt_toolkit  &lt;http://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit&gt;`_. This includes a  lot of Vi key bindings, it's platform independent and runs on every Python  version from python 2.6 up to 3.4. It also runs on Pypy with a noticable  performance boost.- Several ``:set ...`` commands have been implemented, like ``incsearch``,  ``number``, ``ignorecase``, ``wildmenu``, ``expandtab``, ``hlsearch``,  ``ruler``, ``paste`` and ``tabstop``.- Other working commands: ``vsplit``, ``tabnew``, ``only``, ``badd``, and many  others.- For Python source code, auto completion uses the amazing Jedi library, and  code checking in done (asynchronously) through Pyflakes.- Colorschemes can be changed at runtime.Further, when the project develops, it should also become possible to writeextensions in Python, and use Python as a scripting language. (Instead ofvimscript, for instance.)We can also do some cool stuff. Like for instance running the editor on thePython asyncio event loop and having other coroutines interact with the editor.Some more screenshots---------------------Editing its own source code:.. image :: https://github.com/jonathanslenders/pyvim/raw/master/docs/images/editing-pyvim-source.pngWindow layouts (horizontal and vertical splits + tab pages.).. image :: https://github.com/jonathanslenders/pyvim/raw/master/docs/images/window-layout.pngPyflakes for Python code checking and Jedi for autocompletion:.. image :: https://github.com/jonathanslenders/pyvim/raw/master/docs/images/pyflakes-and-jedi.pngOther colorschemes:.. image :: https://github.com/jonathanslenders/pyvim/raw/master/docs/images/colorschemes.pngChinese and Japanese input (double width characters):.. image :: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonathanslenders/pyvim/master/docs/images/cjk.png?v2Configuring pyvim-----------------It is possible to create a ``.pyvimrc`` file for a custom configuration.Have a look at this example: `pyvimrc&lt;https://github.com/jonathanslenders/pyvim/blob/master/examples/config/pyvimrc&gt;`_Limitations-----------Compared to Vi Improved, Pyvim is still less powerful in many aspects.- ``prompt_toolkit`` does not (or not yet) allow buffers to have an individual  cursor when buffers are opened in several windows. Currently, this results in  some unexpected behaviour, when a file is displayed in two windows at the  same time. (The cursor could be displayed in the wrong window and other  windows will sometimes scroll along when the cursor moves.) This has to be  fixed in the future.- The data structure for a buffer is extremely simple. (Right now, it's just a  Python string, and an integer for the cursor position.) This works extremely  well for development and quickly prototyping of new features, but it comes  with a performance penalty. Depending on the system, when a file has above a  thousand lines and syntax highlighting is enabled, editing will become  noticable slower. (The bottleneck is probably the ``BufferControl`` code,  which on every key press tries to reflow the text and calls pygments for  highlighting. And this is Python code looping through single characters.)- A lot of nice Vim features, like line folding, macros, etcetera are not yet  implemented.- Windows support is not that nice. It works, but could be improved. (I think  most Windows users are not that interested in this project, but prove me  wrong.)Roadmap-------There is no roadmap. I mostly implement the stuff which I need or interests me,or which gives me the opportunity to learn. But feel free to create a GitHubissue to request a new feature. Pull requests are also welcome. (Maybe createan issue first to discuss it, if you're unsure whether I'll merge it.)Maybe some day we will have a better data structure (Rope), that makes itpossible to open really large files. (With good algorithms, Python does not haveto be slower than C code.)Maybe we will also have line folding and probably block editing. Maybe someday we will have a built-in Python debugger or mouse support. We'll see. :)Testing-------To run all tests, install pytest:    pip install pytestAnd then run from root pyvim directory:    py.testTo test pyvim against all supported python versions, install tox:    pip install toxAnd then run from root pyvim directory:    toxYou need to have installed all the supported versions of python in order to runtox command successfully.Why did I create Pyvim?-----------------------There are several reasons.The main reason is maybe because it was a small step after I created the Python``prompt-toolkit`` library. That is a library which is actually only a simplypure Python readline replacement, but with some nice additions like syntaxhighlighting and multiline editing. It was never intended to be a toolkit forfull-screen terminal applications, but at some point I realised that everythingwe need for an editor was in there and I liked to challenge its design. So, Istarted an editor and the first proof of concept was literally just a fewhundred lines of code, but it was already a working editor.The creation of ``pyvim`` will make sure that we have a solid architecture for``prompt-toolkit``, but it also aims to demonstrate the flexibility of thelibrary. When it makes sense, features of ``pyvim`` will move back to``prompt-toolkit``, which in turn also results in a better Python REPL.(see `ptpython &lt;https://github.com/jonathanslenders/ptpython&gt;`_, an alternativeREPL.)Above all, it is really fun to create an editor.Alternatives------------Certainly have a look at the alternatives:- Kaa: https://github.com/kaaedit/kaa by @atsuoishimoto- Vai: https://github.com/stefanoborini/vai by @stefanoborini- Vis: https://github.com/martanne/vis by @martanneQ &amp; A:------Q Do you use curses?A No, it uses only ``prompt-toolkit``.Thanks------- To Vi Improved, by Bram Moolenaar.
