Perky files are easy to write by hand.* Explicit minimal data type support.  Rather than guess at the types  of your data, Perky lets you handle the final transformation.* Lightweight, simple, and fast.  Perky's implementation is small  and straightforward.  Ignoring comments and test code, it's about  1k lines of Python.  Fewer lines means fewer bugs!  (Hopefully!)* Flexible and extensible.  Perky permits extending the semantics of  Perky files through a &quot;pragma&quot; mechanism.* Written in 100% pure Python, but still parses &gt;300k lines per  second on a modern desktop.* Perky supports Python 3.6+, and passes its unit test suite with  100% coverage (excluding the deprecated portions).#### Perky syntaxPerky configuration files look something like JSON without thequoting.  It supports only a surprisingly small set of valuetypes:* strings, including quoted strings and  &quot;triple-quoted strings&quot; (multi-line strings),* &quot;mappings&quot; (dicts), and* &quot;sequences&quot; (lists).Perky is line-oriented; individual values go on a singleline.  Container objects use one line per internal value.You may nest lists and dicts as deeply as memory permits.Unlike Python itself, leading whitespace is ignored.You can use leading whitespace however you like but it'soptional.  (Leading whitespace is preserved fortriple-quoted strings, though with a clever syntaxthat allows outdenting the actual value.)Blank lines and comment lines (lines starting with `#`)are ignored, except inside triple-quoted strings.Perky also supports &quot;pragmas&quot;, lines that startwith an equals sign that can perform special runtimebehavior.  By default Perky doesn't define anypragmas--it's an extension mechanism for your use.Here's a sample configuration file exercising allthe things Perky can do:    example name = value    example dict = {        name = 3        another name = 5.0        }    example list = [        a        b        c        ]    nested dict = {        name = value        nesting level 2 = {            nesting level 3 = {                and = so on!                }            }        list inside the dict = [            value in the list                [                and this is in a nested list!                this is another value.                you see?                ]            ]        }    # lines starting with hash are comments and are ignored!    # blank lines are ignored too!    &quot; quoted name &quot; = &quot; quoted value &quot;    triple quoted string = &quot;&quot;&quot;        indenting            is preserved        the string is automatically outdented        to the leftmost character of the *ending*        triple-quote        &lt;-- aka here        &quot;&quot;&quot;    one-line empty list = []    one-line empty dict = {}    one-line empty list with whitespace = [ ]    one-line empty dict with whitespace = { }    multi-line empty list = [        ]    multi-line empty dict = {        }    =pragma    =pragma with argument#### Explicit transformation is better than implicitOne possibly-surprising design choice of Perky: the onlynatively supported values for the Perky parser are dicts,lists, and strings.  What about ints? floats? dates?booleans?  `NULL`?  `None`?Perky deliberately leaves that up to you.  As the ZenOf Python says:*In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.*Perky doesn't know what types your program needs.  So,rather than guess and be wrong, Perky keeps things simple:just lists, dicts, and strings.  For any other type,it's up to you to transform it from a string into the typeyou want, and back again.Note that Perky doesn't care how or if you transform yourdata.  You can use the strings as-is or transform themhowever you like.  You can transform them by hand,or with a third-party data transformation library like[Marshmallow.](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/)(Perky used to support an experimental API for automateddata transformation.  But this was never fully fleshed-out,and there are better versions of that technology out there.I've deprecated the &quot;transformation&quot; submodule and willremove it before 1.0.)### PragmasA *pragma* is a metadata directive for the Perky parser.It's a way of sending instructions to the Perky parser frominside a bit of Perky text.  In Perky, a pragma is a linethat starts with an unquoted equals sign.Here's an example pragma directive:`=command argument here`The first word after the equals sign is the name of the pragma, in this case `&quot;command&quot;`.Everything after the name of the pragma is an argument, with all leadingand trailing whitespace removed, in this case `&quot;argument here&quot;`.By default, Perky doesn't have any pragma handlers.  And invoking a pragmawhen Perky doesn't have a handler for it is a runtime error.But you can define your own pragma handlers when you call `load()`or `loads()`, using a named parameter called `pragmas`.If you pass in a value for `pragmas`, it must be a mappingof strings to functions.The string name should be the name of the pragma and must be lowercase.The function it maps to will &quot;handle&quot; that pragma, and should match thisprototype:`def pragma_fn(parser, argument)``parser` is the internal Perky `Parser` object.  `argument` is therest of the relevant line, with leading &amp; trailing whitespace stripped.(If the rest of the line was empty, `argument` will be `None`).The return value of the pragma function is ignored.There's currently only one predefined pragma handler, a function called`pragma_include()`.  This adds &quot;include statement&quot; functionalityto Perky.  If you call this:`load(filename, pragmas={'include': pragma_include()})`then Perky will interpret lines inside `filename` starting with `=include`as include statements, using the rest of the line as the name of a file.For more information, see `pragma_include()` below.The rules of pragmas:* To invoke a pragma, use `=` as the first non-whitespace character  on a line.* The names of pragmas must always be lowercase.* You can invoke a pragma inside a sequence or mapping context.  But you can't invoke a pragma inside a triple-quoted string.* Pragmas can be &quot;context-sensitive&quot;: they can be aware of where  they are run inside a file, and e.g. modify the current dict  or list.  The pragma function can see the entire current nested  list of dicts and lists being parsed (via `parser.breadcrumbs`).* The rest of the line after the name of the pragma is the  pragma argument value, if any.  This is always a string, which  can be either unquoted or single-quoted; if it's unquoted, it  can't contain any special symbols (`{ } = ''' &quot;&quot;&quot;`).* If you want a line to start with an equals sign (a `value`, or  a `name=value`), but you *don't* want it to be a pragma, just  put quotes around it.  Likewise, if you want to use special  symbols in the pragma argument, just put (single) quotes around  it.### The Parser objectPragma functions recieve the Perky `Parser` object as anargument.  This object encapsulates all the current stateof parsing the Perky file at the current time.  Here arethe relevant attributes you may want to use from yourpragma:* `parser.source` contains the source of the current  Perky text, either a filename or the string '&lt;string&gt;'.* `parser.line_number` contains the line number of  the current line being parsed.  The first line of the  Perky text is line 1.* `parser.stack` is a stack of references to collection  objects--the stack of nested dicts and lists from the  top to where we are now in the Perky file.  `parser.stack[0]` is always the root, and will be the  object returned by `load` or `loads`.  `parser.stack[-1]`  is always the current context the pragma was run in.  It can be either a list or a dict.  You should determine  which using  `isinstance(parser.stack[-1], collections.abc.Mapping)`;  if this is `True`, the current context is a mapping  context (a dict), and if this is `False` the current  context is a sequence context (a list).### Parsing ErrorsThere are only a few errors possible when parsing a Perky text:* Obviously, syntax errors, for example:    * A line in a dict that doesn't have an unquoted equals sign    * A line in a list that looks like a dict line (`name = value`).      (If you want a value containing an equals sign inside a list,      simply put it in quotes.)    * A triple-quoted string where any line is outdented past      the ending triple quotes line.* Defining the same value twice in the same dict.  This is flagged  as an error, because it could easily be a mistake, and like Python  we don't want to let errors pass silently.* Using an undefined pragma.* Using one of Perky's special tokens as a pragma argument, like  `{`, `[`, `'''`, `&quot;&quot;&quot;`, `[]`, or `{}`.### API#### `loads(s, *, pragmas=None, root=None)`Parses a Perky-format string, and returns a container filledwith the values parsed from that string.If `pragmas` is not `None`, it must be a mapping ofstrings to pragma handler functions.  Please see the**Pragmas** section of the documentation.If `root` is `None`, `loads` behaves as if you passed in anempty `dict`.If `root` is not `None`, it should be a container, eithera mutable mapping (`dict`) or a mutable sequence (`list`).This affects how the data is parsed; if `root` is amutable mapping, the top level of the Perky file must bea &quot;mapping context&quot; (a series of `name=value` lines);if `root` is a mutable sequence, the top level of the Perkyfile is assumed to be a &quot;sequence context&quot;(a series of `value` lines).#### `load(filename, *, pragmas=None, root=None)`Loads a file containing Perky-file-format settings.Returns a dict.The text in the file must be encoded using[UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).If `root` is `None`, `loads` behaves as if you passed in anempty `dict`.If `root` is not `None`, it should be a container, eithera mutable mapping (`dict`) or a mutable sequence (`list`).This affects how the data is parsed; if `root` is amutable mapping, the top level of the Perky file must bea &quot;mapping context&quot; (a series of `name=value` lines);if `root` is a mutable sequence, the top level of the Perkyfile is assumed to be a &quot;sequence context&quot;(a series of `value` lines).If `pragmas` is not `None`, it must be a mapping ofstrings to pragma handler functions.  Please see the**Pragmas** section of the documentation.#### `dumps(d)`Converts a dictionary to a Perky-file-format string.Keys in the dictionary must all be strings.  Valuesthat are not dicts, lists, or strings will be convertedto strings using str.Returns a string.#### `dump(filename, d)`Converts a dictionary to a Perky-file-format stringusing `dump`, then writes it to *filename*.The text in the file will be encoded using[UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).#### `pragma_include(include_path=(&quot;.&quot;,))`This function generates a pragma handler that adds &quot;include&quot;functionality.  &quot;Including&quot; means lexically inserting one Perkyfile inside another, contextually at the spot where the pragmaexists.For example, if you ran this:    d = loads(&quot;a=3\n&quot; &quot;=include data.pky\n&quot; &quot;c=5\n&quot;,        pragmas={&quot;include&quot;: pragma_include()},        )And *data.pky* in the current directory was readable andcontained the following text:    b=4then `d` would be set to the dictionary:    {'a': '3', 'b': '4', 'c': '5'}`pragma_include()` is not the pragma handler itself;it returns a function (a closure) which remembers the `include_path`you pass in.  This allows you to use it for multiple pragmas thatinclude from different paths, e.g.:    include_dirs = [appdirs.user_data_dir(myapp_name)]    config_dirs = [appdirs.user_config_dir(myapp_name)]    pragmas = {        'include': pragma_include(include_dirs),        'config': pragma_include(config_dirs),    }Notes:* The pragma handler is context-sensitive; the includedfile will be included as if it was copied-and-pasted replacingthe pragma line.  Among other things, this means that if the pragmais invoked inside a sequence context, the included file must *start*in a sequence context.* When loading the file, the pragma handler will pass in thecurrent pragma handlers into `load()`.  Among other things,this allows for recursive includes.* When including inside a dict context, you're explicitly permittedto re-define existing keys if they were previously defined inanother file.* The default value for `include_path` only searches thecurrent directory (`&quot;.&quot;`).  If you override the defaultand pass in your own include path, the pragma handlerwon't search the current directory unless you explicitlyadd `&quot;.&quot;` to the include path yourself.* If `pragma_include` can't find the requested file onits search path, it raises `FileNotFoundError`.#### Deprecated APIPerky has a &quot;transformation&quot; submodule.The idea is, you load a Perky file,then run `transform` on that dictionary toconvert the strings into native values.These functions are no longer maintained or supported,and will be removed before 1.0.Why?  This part of Perky was alwaysan experiment... and the experiment never really paidoff.  There are better implementations of this idea,like [Marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/)--youyou should use those instead.  (If you're relying onthis code in Perky, I encourage you to forkoff a copy and maintain it yourself.  But I doubtanybody is.)For posterity's sakes, here's documentation of thenow-deprecated API.`map(d, fn) -&gt; o`Iterates over a dictionary.  Returns a new dictionary where,for every *value*:  * if it's a dict, replace with a new dict.  * if it's a list, replace with a new list.  * if it's neither a dict nor a list, replace with    `fn(value)`.The function passed in is called a *conversion function*.`transform(d, schema, default=None) -&gt; o`Recursively transforms a Perky dict into some otherobject (usually a dict) using the provided schema.Returns a new dict.A *schema* is a data structure matching the general expectedshape of *d*, where the values are dicts, lists, andcallables.  The transformation is similar to `map()`except that individual values will have individual conversionfunctions.  Also, a schema conversion function can be specifiedfor any value in *d*, even dicts or lists.*default* is a default conversion function.  If there is avalue *v* in *d* that doesn't have an equivalent entry in *schema*,and *v* is neither a list nor a dict, and if *default* isa callable, *v* will be replaced with `default(v)` in theoutput.`Required`Experimental.`nullable(fn) -&gt; fn`Experimental.`const(fn) -&gt; o`Experimental.### TODO* Backslash quoting currently does &quot;whatever your version of Python does&quot;.  Perhaps this should be explicit, and parsed by Perky itself?### Changelog**0.9.1** *2023/07/03** API change: the `Parser` attribute `breadcrumbs` has been  renamed to `stack`.  It was previously undocumented anyway,  though has now been documented.* Added the `line_number` and `source` attributes to the  `Parser` object, for the convenience of pragma handlers.* Refactored `parser_include` slightly.  No change to  functionality or behavior, just a small code cleanup pass.* Added a &quot;lines per second&quot; output metric to the  benchmark program.**0.9** *2023/07/02*Breaking API change: removed the `encoding` argument entirely.* From this point forward, Perky only supports reading and  writing files in  [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).  If you need to work with a different encoding, you'll have  to handle loading it form and saving it to disk yourself.  You'll have to use `loads` and `dumps` to handle converting  between Perky string format and native Python objects.* Optimized Perky some more.  It's roughly 11% faster than 0.8.1.**0.8.2** *2023/06/30** Minor API changes:  - You can now pass an `encoding` keyword argument    into `pragma_include`.  This is now the only way    to specify the encoding used to decode files    loaded from disk by `pragma_include`.  - Removed the (undocumented) `encoding` attribute    of Perky's `Parser` object.  - Removed the `encoding` parameter for `loads`.  - The `encoding` parameter for `load` is now only    used by `load` itself when loading the top-level    Perky file.**0.8.1** *2023/06/26** Whoops!  A major regression: I inadveretently changed the default  conversion of non-string values from `str` to `repr`.  Bad move!  `str` is much better.  Added a test so I don't do this again.**0.8** *2023/06/25** Perky now explicitly performs its `isinstance` checks using  `collections.abc.MutableMapping` and `collections.abc.MutableSequence`  instead of `dict` and `list`.  This permits you to use  your own mapping and sequence objects that *don't* inherit from  `dict` and `list`.* Renamed `PerkyFormatError` to `FormatError`.  The old name is  supported for now, but please transition to the new name.  The old name will be removed before 1.0.* The &quot;transformation&quot; submodule is now deprecated and unsupported.  Please either stop using it or fork and maintain it yourself.  This includes `map`, `transform`, `Required`,  `nullable`, and `const`.* Perky now has a proper unit test suite, which it passes with 100%  coverage--except for the unsupported `transform` submodule.* While working towards 100% coverage, also cleaned up the code  a little in spots.  - Retooled `LineTokenizer`:    - Changed its name from `LineParser` is now `LineTokenizer`.      It never parsed anything, it just tokenized.    - Made its API a little more uniform: now, the      only function that will raise `StopIteration` is `__next__`.    - The other functions that used to maybe raise `StopIteration`      now return a tuple of `None` values when the iterator is empty.      This means you can safely write `for a, b, c in line_tokenizer:`.    - `bool(lt)` is now accurate; if it returns `True`,      you can call `next(lt)` or `lt.next_line()` or `lt.tokens()`      and be certain you'll get a value back.  - Replaced `RuntimeError` exceptions with more appropriate    exceptions (`ValueError`, `TypeError`).</longdescription>
