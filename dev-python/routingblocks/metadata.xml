	<longdescription># RoutingBlocks`RoutingBlocks` is an open-source Python package for the implementation of algorithms for Vehicle Routing Problems withIntermediate Stops.It provides a set of modular algorithmic components and efficient data structures that can be used as building blocksfor problem-specific metaheuristic algorithms. These components are tailored specifically to tackle the challenges ofVRPIS, but can be used for other classes of vehicle routing problems as well.*This package is under active development. Expect potentially breaking changes.*## InstallationThe package is available on PyPI and can be installed using `pip`:```bashpip install routingblocks```To obtain the bleeding-edge development version, run```bashpip install git+https://github.com/tumBAIS/RoutingBlocks```instead.## Features* Efficient C++-based solution representation* Customizable Local Search Solver* Framework for ALNS-based metaheuristics* Efficient native implementations of numerous destroy, repair, and local search operators* Move caches implemented in native code to allow high-performance operator implementations in Python* Support for custom [native extensions](https://github.com/tumBAIS/routingblocks-native-extension-example)## UsageWe provide an [example implementation](https://github.com/tumBAIS/RoutingBlocks/tree/main/examples) of an ALNS-basedalgorithm forthe [EVRPTW-PR](https://research.sabanciuniv.edu/id/eprint/26033/1/WP_EVRPTW-Partial_Recharge_KeskinCatay.pdf) as partof this repository.Further documentation is availableat [readthedocs](https://routingblocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).## ContributingPull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue firstto discuss what you would like to change.See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information and documentation on setting up a development environment.## License[MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)</longdescription>
