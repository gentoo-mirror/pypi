	<longdescription>![pyMOR Logo](./logo/pymor_logo.svg)pyMOR - Model Order Reduction with Python=========================================pyMOR is a software library for building model orderreduction applications with the Python programming language. Implementedalgorithms include reduced basis methods for parametric linear and non-linearproblems, as well as system-theoretic methods such as balanced truncation orIRKA (Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm).  All algorithms in pyMOR areformulated in terms of abstract interfaces for seamless integration withexternal PDE (Partial Differential Equation) solver packages.  Moreover, purePython implementations of FEM (Finite Element Method) and FVM (Finite VolumeMethod) discretizations using the NumPy/SciPy scientific computing stack areprovided for getting started quickly.[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pymor.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymor)[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pymor.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymor)[![Docs](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.pymor.org%2Fbadge.json)](https://docs.pymor.org/)[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/9220688.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/9220688)[![GitLab Pipeline](https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/pymor/pymor/badges/main/pipeline.svg)](https://zivgitlab.uni-muenster.de/pymor/pymor/commits/main)[![Conda Tests](https://github.com/pymor/pymor/actions/workflows/conda_tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pymor/pymor/actions/workflows/conda_tests.yml)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/pymor/pymor/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/pymor/pymor)License-------Copyright pyMOR developers and contributors.

Milk, S. Rave, F. Schindler    pyMOR - Generic Algorithms and Interfaces for Model Order Reduction    SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 38(5), pp. S194--S216, 2016Installation via pip--------------------We recommend installation of pyMOR in a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).pyMOR can easily be installed with the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)command:    pip install --upgrade pip  # make sure that pip is reasonably new    pip install pymor[full](Please note that pip versions prior to 21.1 might have problems resolving all dependencies)This will install the latest release of pyMOR on your system with most optionaldependencies.For Linux we provide binary wheels, so no further system packages shouldbe required. Use    pip install pymorfor an installation with minimal dependencies.There are some optional packages not included with `pymor[full]`because they need additional setup on your system:* for support of MPI distributed models and parallelization of greedy algorithms  (requires MPI development headers and a C compiler):      pip install mpi4py* dense matrix equation solver for system-theoretic MOR methods, required for  H-infinity norm calculation (requires OpenBLAS headers and a Fortran  compiler):      pip install slycot* dense and sparse matrix equation solver for system-theoretic MOR methods  (other backends available):  * from [source](https://gitlab.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/mess/cmess-releases)    (recommended)  * using a [wheel](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/mess)If you are not operating in a virtual environment, you can pass the optional `--user`argument to pip. pyMOR will then only be installed for yourlocal user, not requiring administrator privileges.To install the latest development version of pyMOR, execute    pip install git+https://github.com/pymor/pymor#egg=pymor[full]which will require that the [git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system isinstalled on your system.From time to time, the main branch of pyMOR undergoes major changes and thingsmight break (this is usually announced in our [discussion forum](https://github.com/pymor/pymor/discussions)),so you might prefer to install pyMOR from the current release branch:    pip install git+https://github.com/pymor/pymor@2022.2.x#egg=pymor[full]Release branches will always stay stable and will only receive bugfix commitsafter the corresponding release has been made.Installation via conda----------------------pyMOR can be installed using `conda` by running    conda install -c conda-forge pymorDocumentation-------------Documentation is available [online](https://docs.pymor.org/)or you can build it yourself from inside the root directory of the pyMOR source treeby executing:    make docsThis will generate HTML documentation in `docs/_build/html`.Useful Links------------* [Latest Changelog](https://docs.pymor.org/latest/release_notes/all.html)* [Getting Started](https://docs.pymor.org/latest/getting_started.html)* [Dependencies](https://github.com/pymor/pymor/blob/2022.2.x/requirements.txt)External PDE solvers--------------------pyMOR has been designed with easy integration of external PDE solversin mind.A basic approach is to use the solver only to generate high-dimensionalsystem matrices which are then read by pyMOR from disk (`pymor.discretizers.disk`).Another possibility is to steer the solver via an appropriate networkprotocol.Whenever possible, we recommend to recompile the solver as aPython extension module which gives pyMOR direct access to the solver withoutany communication overhead. A basic example using[pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) can be found in`src/pymordemos/minimal_cpp_demo`. Moreover,we provide bindings for the following solver libraries:* [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org)    MPI-compatible wrapper classes for dolfin linear algebra data structures are    shipped with pyMOR (`pymor.bindings.fenics`).    For an example see `pymordemos.thermalblock`, `pymordemos.thermalblock_simple`.    It is tested using FEniCS version 2019.1.0.* [deal.II](https://dealii.org)    Python bindings and pyMOR wrapper classes can be found    [here](https://github.com/pymor/pymor-deal.II).* [NGSolve](https://ngsolve.org)    Wrapper classes for the NGSolve finite element library are shipped with pyMOR    (`pymor.bindings.ngsolve`).    For an example see `pymordemos.thermalblock_simple`.    It is tested using NGSolve version v6.2.2104.Do not hesitate to contact[us](https://github.com/pymor/pymor/discussions) if youneed help with the integration of your PDE solver.External Matrix Equation Solvers--------------------------------pyMOR also provides bindings to matrix equation solvers (in `pymor.bindings`),which are needed for the system-theoretic methods and need to be installedseparately. Bindings for the following solver libraries are included:* [Py-M.E.S.S.](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/mess)    The Matrix Equation Sparse Solver library is intended for solving large sparse matrix equations (`pymor.bindings.pymess`).* [Slycot](https://github.com/python-control/Slycot)    Python wrapper for the Subroutine Library in Systems and Control Theory (SLICOT) is also used for Hardy norm computations (`pymor.bindings.slycot`).Environments for pyMOR Development and Tests-----------------------------------------------Please see the [Developer Documentation](https://docs.pymor.org/latest/developer_docs.html).Contact-------Should you have any questions regarding pyMOR or wish to contribute,do not hesitate to contact us via our GitHub discussions forum:&lt;https://github.com/pymor/pymor/discussions&gt;</longdescription>
