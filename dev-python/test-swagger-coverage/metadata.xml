The file can be created automatically or manually.Next, we set up api calls in our tests (we wrap them with decorators, see examples) and at the end of testing we generate html report.We will check which endpoints were called and what statuses we checked.We can't always trust our swagger, so you can manually set the status of the codes yourself, which need to be checked.Examples------------First, we need a link to your swagger. For example,  let's take this  https://petstore.swagger.io/Next, in our project, we need to create a file describing our endpoints, which our tests will use to generate a coverage report.We can do it automatically via the command line, get json swagger file    $ swagger_coverage https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.jsonResult    $ 2022-04-15 11:22:37 INFO Start load swagger swagger_coverage https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json    $ 2022-04-15 11:22:38 INFO The swagger report was successfully saved to the folder: /Users/user/Documents/git/python-api-tests/swagger_reportThe **swagger_report** directory will be createdand a **data_swagger.yaml** file will appear inside, which will be the settings for building a test coverage reportThe **data_swagger.yaml** file looks something like this ``` ...addPet:  description: 'Add new pet'  method: POST  path: /pet  statuses:  - 200  - 404  tag: pet  ... ```where **regUser** is the unique id of our endpoint**statuses** is a list of statuses that we will check (that they were called).You can customize this list yourself.Only we will check 201 status, as described in the user registration swagger. So I will add it.Let's create a simple test and build a report. For requests, you will use the **requests** library.```pythonimport requestsfrom swagger_coverage.src.coverage import SwaggerCoveragefrom swagger_coverage.src.deco import swagger# swagger data preparationswagger_url = &quot;https://api.swaggerhub.com/apis/berpress/flask-rest-api/1.0.0&quot;api_url = &quot;https://api.swaggerhub.com/apis/&quot;path='/report' # path to swagger coverage reportswagger_rep = SwaggerCoverage(api_url=api_url, url=swagger_url, path=path)swagger_rep.create_coverage_data()# function to call a request to the server@swagger(&quot;regUser&quot;)def register_user(payload: dict):    return requests.post('https://stores-tests-api.herokuapp.com/register',                         json=payload)# testdata = {&quot;username&quot;: &quot;test2023@test.com&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;Password&quot;}response = register_user(data)assert response.status_code == 201# create reportswagger_rep.create_report()```**swagger data preparation**: Prepare our file data_swagger.yaml, it will be created automatically.**function to call a request to the server**:  We will write a user registration call. Declaring a function with a decorator **@swagger(&quot;regUser&quot;)**.**&quot;regUser&quot;** taken from file **data_swagger.yaml**, this is unique id of our endpoint.**test**: run the test**create report**: create a report.After that, in the folder **swagger_report** we will receive a report **index.html**.Let's see it![](https://github.com/berpress/python-api-tests/blob/main/images/swagger_register.png)As you can see, we have increased the counter of verified endpointsIf you use **pytest**, add this code in conftest.py```python@pytest.fixture(scope=&quot;session&quot;, autouse=True)def swagger_checker(request):    url = request.config.getoption(&quot;--swagger-url&quot;)    url_api = request.config.getoption(&quot;--api-url&quot;)    path = '/report'    swagger = SwaggerCoverage(api_url=url_api, url=url, path=path)    swagger.create_coverage_data()    yield    swagger.create_report()```Also, at the end of the report, you can find a table of average request times for routes![](https://github.com/berpress/python-api-tests/blob/main/images/requets_time.png?raw=true)Also, at the end of the report, you can find a table of average request times for routesMore example with pytest and API tests https://github.com/berpress/python-api-testsReport example [https://github.com/berpress/python-api-tests/tree/main/swagger_report](https://github.com/berpress/python-api-tests/tree/main/report)</longdescription>
