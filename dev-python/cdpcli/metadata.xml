	<longdescription># Cloudera CDP Command Line InterfaceThis package provides a unified command line interface to the Cloudera DataPlatform (CDP) control plane API.## Prerequisites* Python 3.6 or higherEarlier versions of Python are no longer supported for new releases, as ofJanuary 2021. Previous CLI releases shall continue to work under earlier Pythonversions.Starting with version 0.9.24, the requests and urllib3 libraries are no longerbundled with the CLI. When upgrading, watch for those new dependencies to beinstalled.## InstallationTo install using `pip` from the[cdpcli PyPI project](https://pypi.org/project/cdpcli/):```$ pip install cdpcli```To install from source:```$ git clone git@github.com:cloudera/cdpcli.git$ cd cdpcli$ pip install .```### Beta CLIAn alternative CLI exposing beta functionality is available in its own package.```$ pip install cdpcli-beta```Do not install both the regular and beta CLIs in the same Python environment,as they use the same entry points and therefore conflict.Any features exposed in the beta CLI that are not available in the regular CLIare still under development. They are not yet supported, may not work, and aresubject to change in incompatible ways, including removal. Do not rely on betafeatures for production use.## ConfiguringAPI calls through the CDP CLI require a key pair issued from the CDP controlplane. Use the CDP console to generate keys, following [documentedinstructions](https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp/latest/cli/topics/mc-cli-generating-an-api-access-key.html).Then, run `cdp configure` to provide the credentials to the CLI.```$ cdp configureCDP Access Key ID [None]: xxxCDP Private Key [None]: yyy```Credentials are stored under the &quot;default&quot; profile in *$HOME/.cdp/credentials*,using the ini file format.```[default]cdp_access_key_id = xxxcdp_private_key = yyy```### ProfilesIf you need to access the API as more than one user, set up a named profile foreach user. Each profile stores a separate set of credentials.```$ cdp configure --profile my-other-user```The credentials for a profile are stored in *$HOME/.cdp/credentials* under asection named for the profile.### Credential Environment VariablesAn alternative to storing credentials in *$HOME/.cdp/credentials* is to passthem using the environment variables `CDP_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `CDP_PRIVATE_KEY`.However, these variables are ignored when the `--profile` option is used whenrunning the CLI (see below).### Base Endpoint URL and Form FactorThe CLI may be used to access[CDP Private Cloud](https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-private-cloud/latest/overview/topics/cdppvc-overview.html)control planes. Contact your control plane administrator to obtain the requiredbase endpoint URL value for your installation. Set the value in*$HOME/.cdp/config*, another configuration file that uses the ini file format.Create a section named for the profile which should work with the private cloudcontrol plane.```[profile private1]cdp_endpoint_url = https://cdp-private.example.com```The CLI guesses whether it is using CDP Public Cloud or CDP Private Cloud basedon the base endpoint URL. If you find that it is guessing incorrectly, you canconfigure use of either *form factor* in *$HOME/.cdp/config*. Valid form factorvalues are &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot;.```[profile private1]form_factor = private```## RunningBasic syntax:```cdp [options] &lt;command&gt; &lt;subcommand&gt; [parameters]```Examples:```$ cdp iam get-user$ cdp environments describe-environments --environment-name myenv1```### HelpFor general help, use any of these commands.```$ cdp help$ cdp --help$ cdp # no arguments```Most CLI commands correspond to API services. Subcommands correspond tooperations in services.* For help on any command, run its `help` subcommand, or pass the `--help` parameter.* For help on any subcommand, pass the `help` or `--help` parameter.The same help content is available in online[API documentation](https://cloudera.github.io/cdp-dev-docs/api-docs/).### ProfilesBy default, the CLI uses credentials in the &quot;default&quot; profile. Use a differentprofile by passing the `--profile` option.```$ cdp --profile my-other-user iam get-user```### Base Endpoint URL and Form FactorBy default, the CLI works with[CDP Public Cloud](https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp/latest/overview/topics/cdp-overview.html)and calculates API endpoints accordingly. If you are using CDP Private Cloud, besure to provide the base endpoint URL for your private cloud control plane. Youcan do so by setting it in *$HOME/.cdp/config* for the desired profile, orthrough the `--endpoint-url` option, which supersedes the configuration.```$ cdp --endpoint-url https://other.cdp-private.example.com ...```The CLI guesses whether it is using CDP Public Cloud or CDP Private Cloud basedon the base endpoint URL. If you find that it is guessing incorrectly, you canforce use of either *form factor* by either setting it in *$HOME/.cdp/config*for the desired profile, or through the `--form-factor` option, which supersedesthe configuration. Specifying a form factor does not alter the base endpoint URL in use.```$ cdp --form-factor private ...```## LicenseThe CDP CLI is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)with a [supplemental license disclaimer](https://console.cdp.cloudera.com/downloads/LICENSE_SUPPLEMENTAL_DISCLAIMER.txt).</longdescription>
