	<longdescription># AmnioticA multi-output ambient sound mixer for Home Assistant.Amniotic lets you use a single device to create on-the-fly, custom ambient audio mixes - e.g. mixing Waterfall soundswith Birdsong on one set of speakers, while playing Fireplace sounds from a second audio device - to suit your tastesand environment.The library integrates with Home Assistant via MQTT as a new device, allowing you to create and control ambient mixesfrom the Home Assistant interface.### Why Would I Want Such a Thing?I won't explain the general reasons for introducing non-musical sounds into one's environment, but if youfind [sound masking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_masking) helps you concentrate in noisy environments, ifyou're (as I am) slightly [misophonic](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-misophonia), if youuse [white noise machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise_machine) to induce sleep or relaxation, or if youjust think sound is an important factor in setting a pleasant ambience, then you might find Amniotic useful.### Can't I do This with Spotify, Volumio, HifiBerry etc.?Since those systems are intended for music, they aren't designed for playing or mixing multiple streams simultaneouslywith a single device, even if set up in multi-room configurations. Also, the streaming services often won't allow asingle account to play multiple streams, even _if_ multiple devices are used.Anyway, those limitations motivated this library.There are two ways to install and run Amniotic:- On the Home Assistant machine itself, as an add-on.- Install manually, on a separate machine.## Home Assistant AddonTo add as an Addon, click here:[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://link.frontmatter.ai/amniotic/addon-install)## DocumentationFor non-addon installs, and general documentation, see **[the project wiki](https://link.frontmatter.ai/amniotic/doc)**.</longdescription>
