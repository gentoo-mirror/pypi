Catcher is not about only http, itcan check different services, such as Kafka, Postgres, CouchBase, Mongodb, Elastic, S3, emails and others.Quickstart and documentation----------------------------1. Check, how to write a `test &lt;https://catcher-test-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/tests.html&gt;`_.2. Get to know how to `install &lt;https://catcher-test-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/run.html&gt;`_ and run Catcher.3. List all `steps &lt;https://catcher-test-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/steps.html&gt;`_ and select those you need.4. Learn more about `variables &lt;https://catcher-test-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/variables.html&gt;`_ and `resources &lt;https://catcher-test-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/resources.html&gt;`_5. Read how to trace and debug your test using `reports &lt;https://catcher-test-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/reports.html&gt;`_For more information check `readthedocs`_.Very quick start----------------You can run Catcher in `docker`_ with all libraries, drivers and steps already installed and configured. It allowsyou to try Catcher without installing anything.Just run the minimal command::    docker run -v $(pwd)/inventory:/opt/catcher/inventory               -v $(pwd)/tests:/opt/catcher/tests                catcher -i inventory/my_inventory.yml testsIt will ask Catcher to run everything within your local **tests** folder using **inventory/my_inventory.yml**. For moreinformation please check run `instructions &lt;https://catcher-test-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/run.html&gt;`_.. _docker: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/comtihon/catcherHow does it look like?----------------------Imagine you have a **user_service** which saves users in **postgre** and posts them to **kafka** topic, where they areconsumed by another service, which sends them emails.You mention your environment in the inventory files.local.yml::    kafka_server: '127.0.0.1:9092'    postgres: 'test:test@localhost:5433/test'    user_service: 'http://127.0.0.1:9090'    email_config:        host: '127.0.0.1:12345'        user: 'local_user'        pass: 'local_pass'develop.yml::    kafka_server: 'kafka.dev.mycompany.com:9092'    postgres: 'dev:dev@postgres.dev.mycompany.com:5433/test'    user_service: 'http://user_service.dev.mycompany.com:9090'    email_config:        host: 'imap.google.com'        user: 'my_user@google.com'        pass: 'my_pass'You write a test::    variables: # here you specify test-local variables        users:            - email: '{{ test_user@my_company.com }}'              name: '{{ random(&quot;name&quot;) }}' # templates fully supported            - email: '{{ random(&quot;email&quot;) }}'              name: '{{ random(&quot;name&quot;) }}'    steps: # here you write steps which Catcher executed one by one until it fails        - http:            post:                url: '{{ user_service }}/sign_up' # user_service value is taken from active inventory which you specify at runtime                body: '{{ users[0] }}' # send first user from variables as a POST body                headers: {Content-Type: 'application/json'}                response_code: 2xx # will accept 200-299 codes            name: 'Register {{ users[0].email }} as a new user' # name your step properly (Optional)            register: {user_id: '{{ OUTPUT.id }}'}  # register new variable user_id as id param from json response        - postgres: # check if user was saved in the database            request:                conf: '{{ postgres }}'                sql: 'select * from users where user_id = {{ user_id }}'  # user_id from previous step will be used in this template            register: {email_in_db: '{{ OUTPUT.email }}'}  # load full user data and register only email as a new variable        - check: # compare email from the database with real user email            equals: {the: '{{ users[0].email }}', is: '{{ email_id_db }}'}}  # checks the equality between two strings. Templates supported.        - kafka:            consume:  # check if user_service pushed newly created user to kafka                server: '{{ kafka_server }}' # kafka_server value is taken from active inventory                topic: 'new_users'                where: # filter all messages except messages for our user                    equals: {the: '{{ MESSAGE.user_id }}', is: '{{ user_id }}'}        - email: # check if email was sent for this user              receive:                  config: '{{ email_conf }}'                  filter: {unread: true, subject: 'Welcome {{ users[0].name }}'} # select all unread and filter by subject                  ack: true  # mark as read                  limit: 1              register: {messages: '{{ OUTPUT }}'}  # register all messages found (0 or 1)        - check: '{{ messages |length &gt; 0 }}' # short form of compare - we should have more than 0 messages co pass this step    finally:        - postgres: # delete user from database to cleanup after test finishes (no matter successfully or not)            request:                conf: '{{ postgres }}'                sql: 'delete from users where user_id = {{ user_id }}'For local environment run it as::    catcher -i inventories/local.yml tests/my_test.ymlFor dev::    catcher -i inventories/develop.yml tests/my_test.ymlSee `microservices`_ for more complex example.Customization-------------Catcher can be easily customized to serve your needs.1. You can write your own functions and filters and use them in your step's `templates &lt;https://catcher-test-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/filters_and_functions.html&gt;`_.2. You can create your own `modules &lt;https://catcher-test-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/modules.html&gt;`_ (in Python, Java, Kotlin, JS, jar-files or any executable)3. You can write your steps in catcher itself and `include &lt;https://catcher-test-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/includes.html#run-on-action&gt;`_ them from other tests.Why catcher?------------* don't repeat test code. Write one test and call its steps from another;* compute and override variables to check your data and compose new flexible requests;* write test for development, change inventory and test stage/uat/prod with no changes;* test your data pipelines with `Airflow &lt;https://catcher-modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/airflow.html&gt;`_ step;* test your front-end &lt;-&gt; back-end integration with `Selenium &lt;https://catcher-modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/selenium.html&gt;`_ step;* test all your `microservices`_ with ease;* `modular`_ architecture* bulk-prepare and bulk-check data for you tests with `prepare-expect`_ step* automate your testing!Changelog is `here &lt;https://github.com/comtihon/catcher/blob/master/Changelog.rst&gt;`_.Contributors:-------------* Many thanks to `Ekaterina Belova &lt;https://github.com/kbelova&gt;`_ for core &amp; modules contribution... _readthedocs: https://catcher-test-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.. _microservices: https://catcher-test-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/microservices.html.. _modular: https://catcher-test-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/modules.html.. _prepare-expect: https://catcher-modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/prepare_expect.html.. _selenium: https://catcher-modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/selenium.html</longdescription>
