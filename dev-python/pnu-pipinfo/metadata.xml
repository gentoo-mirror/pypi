	<longdescription># InstallationOnce you have installed [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and its packages manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/),depending on if you want only this tool, the full set of PNU tools, or PNU plus a selection of additional third-parties tools, use one of these commands:```pip install pnu-pipinfopip install PNUpip install pytnix```# PIPINFO(1)## NAMEpipinfo - Alternative tool for listing Python packages## SYNOPSIS**pipinfo**\[-l|--check-latest\]\[-v|--check-vulns\]\[-c|--no-color\]\[-p|--no-progress\]\[-i|--info\]\[-S|--system\]\[-U|--user\]\[-I|--issues\]\[-O|--outdated\]\[-L|--latest|--uptodate\]\[-V|--vulnerable\]\[-H|--healthy|--sane\]\[-N|--not-required\]\[-R|--required\]\[--debug\]\[--help|-?\]\[--version\]\[--\]\[directory ...\]## DESCRIPTIONThe **pipinfo** utility provides an alternative to the &quot;pip list&quot;, &quot;pip list --outdated&quot;, &quot;pip show&quot; and &quot;pip-audit&quot; commands.It shows all the available packages in the Python PATH (not just the latest version) or given directories (even for different Python versions), differenciates user and system-wide packages (user packages are written in bright style), show duplicate packages (name in yellow foreground, including user versions shadowing system ones), shows each package summary (avoiding the use of &quot;pip show&quot; to discover what a package is about), and prints the count of installed packages.With the *-l|--check-latest* option, it will also use a Python Index Package web service to check for the latest versions available, using a simple color (version in yellow foreground) or visual scheme to show outdated packages and count them.With the *-v|--check-vulns* option, it will also use another Python Index Package web service to check for known vulnerabilities in your packages versions, using a simple color (version in red background) or visual scheme to show vulnerable packages and count them.The color or visual scheme should be enough to tell you to upgrade the indicated packages, however you can print additional details about new versions available and vulnerabilities with the *-i|--info* option.You can disable the color output with the *-c|--no-color* option, and the progress meter with the *-p|--no-progress* option.Finally you can restrict the list to the user or system packages, outdated or up-to-date packages, vulnerable or sane packages, required or not packages with the options in upper case.The most useful one is probably the *-I|--issues* option which will select the outdated or vulnerable packages only.### OPTIONSOptions | Use------- | ----l\|--check-latest|Check latest versions-v\|--check-vulns|Check vulnerabilities-c\|--no-color|Toggle off color output-p\|--no-progress|Toggle off progress meter-i\|--info|Print detailed info on versions &amp;
