Classes that could be easily used in acomposition are tricky to write. The `generics` library aims to help you inwriting code with high quality.## Pros- Real private attributes without loosing the readability- Leads to a better design forcing you to use encapsulation properly- Makes writing quality code with high cohesion and low coupling easier- Guides you to follow SOLID principles## ExampleThe `generics` library gives you an easy way to define private attributes onobjects without loosing little nice things like readability.```pycon&gt;&gt;&gt; from generics import private&gt;&gt;&gt; @private... class User:...     def __init__(self, name):...         self.name = name......     def greet(self):...         return f&quot;Hello, {self.name}&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt; user = User(&quot;Jeff&quot;)&gt;&gt;&gt; user.greet()'Hello, Jeff'&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr(user, &quot;name&quot;)False```## QuestionsIf you have any questions, feel free to create an issue in our[Task Tracker](https://github.com/proofit404/generics/issues). We have the[question label](https://github.com/proofit404/generics/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aquestion)exactly for this purpose.## Enterprise supportIf you have an issue with any version of the library, you can apply for a paidenterprise support contract.
