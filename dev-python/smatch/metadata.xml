	<longdescription># Smatch (semantic match) tool[![Version on PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/smatch)](https://pypi.org/project/smatch/)![Python Support](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/smatch)[Smatch](http://amr.isi.edu/evaluation.html) is an evaluation tool for[AMR](http://amr.isi.edu/) (Abstract Meaning Representation). Itcomputes the Smatch score (defined below) of two AMR graphs in termsof their matching triples (edges) by finding a variable (node) mappingthat maximizes the count, `M`, of matching triples, then:* `M` is the number of matching triples* `T` is the total number of triples in the first AMR* `G` is the total number of triples in the second AMR* Precision is defined as `P = M/T`* Recall is defined as `R = M/G`* The Smatch score is the F-score: `F = 2 * (P*R)/(P+R)`For more information, see [Cai and Knight,2013](https://amr.isi.edu/smatch-13.pdf).## Requirements, Installation, and UsageThis Smatch implementation is tested for Python 3.5 or higher. It isreleased [on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/smatch/) so you caninstall it with `pip`:``` console$ pip install smatch```You can also clone this repository and run the `smatch.py` scriptdirectly as it does not need to be installed to be used.To use the script, run it with at least the `-f` option, which takestwo filename arguments:``` console$ smatch.py -f test.amr gold.amr```Note that the order of these arguments does not matter for the Smatchscore as the F-score is symmetric, but swapping the arguments willswap the precision and recall. The files contain AMRs separated by ablank line, with comment lines starting with `#` (see[`test_input1.txt`](test_input1.txt) for an example).For other options, try `smatch.py --help`.## Citation```bibtex@inproceedings{cai-knight-2013-smatch,    title = &quot;{S}match: an Evaluation Metric for Semantic Feature Structures&quot;,    author = &quot;Cai, Shu and Knight, Kevin&quot;,    booktitle = &quot;Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers)&quot;,    month = aug,    year = &quot;2013&quot;,    address = &quot;Sofia, Bulgaria&quot;,    publisher = &quot;Association for Computational Linguistics&quot;,    url = &quot;https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P13-2131&quot;,    pages = &quot;748--752&quot;,}```## Recommendations for Reproducible ResearchYou can help make your research reproducible by including thefollowing information in your writing:* The software version (e.g., repository URL and version number)* The number of restarts (`-r`) used, even if unchanged from the default* The order of the arguments to `-f` (if reporting precision and recall)* Any other options or preprocessing steps## HistoryThe code was mostly developed during 2012 and 2013, and has undergonemany fixes and updates. Note that the versions distributed for[SemEval-2016](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task8/index.php?id=data-and-tools)were numbered 2.0&amp;ndash;2.0.2, but these predate this repository andthe [1.0 series onPyPI](https://pypi.org/project/smatch/#history). For more details, seethe [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).## Related ProjectsHere are some notable forks of Smatch:* [didzis/pSMATCH](https://github.com/didzis/pSMATCH) adds  parallelization for speed* [isi-nlp/smatch](https://github.com/isi-nlp/smatch) adds an ILP  solver for getting optimal variable mappings* [cfmrp/mtool](https://github.com/cfmrp/mtool) packages the version  of Smatch used for the [MRP](http://mrp.nlpl.eu/) workshop at [CONLL  2019](http://www.conll.org/2019)And here are other evaluation metrics for AMR:* [mdtux89/amr-evaluation](https://github.com/mdtux89/amr-evaluation)  offers a set of metrics based on Smatch for fine-grained evaluation* [freesunshine0316/sembleu](https://github.com/freesunshine0316/sembleu)  is inspired by BLEU and puts more weight on &quot;content&quot; than  graph-structure similarity* [rafaelanchieta/sema](https://github.com/rafaelanchieta/sema/)  weights error types differently and does not consider which node is  the graph's top</longdescription>
