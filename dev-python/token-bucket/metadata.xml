	<longdescription>|Build Status| |PyPi| |codecov.io|A Token Bucket Implementation for Python Web Apps=================================================The ``token-bucket`` package provides an implementation of the`token bucket algorithm &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket&gt;`_suitable for use in web applications for shaping or policing requestrates. This implementation does not require the use of an independenttimer thread to manage the bucket state.Compared to other rate-limiting algorithms that use a simple counter,the token bucket algorithm provides the following advantages:* The thundering herd problem is avoided since bucket capacity is  replenished gradually, rather than being immediately refilled at the  beginning of each epoch as is common with simple fixed window  counters.* Burst duration can be explicitly controlledMoving window algorithms are resistant to bursting, but at the cost ofadditional processing and memory overhead vs. the token bucketalgorithm which uses a simple, fast counter per key. The latter approachdoes allow for bursting, but only for a controlled duration... |Build Status| image:: https://github.com/falconry/token-bucket/workflows/tests/badge.svg   :target: https://github.com/falconry/token-bucket/actions?query=workflow%3A%22tests%22.. |PyPi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/token-bucket.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/token-bucket.. |codecov.io| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/falconry/token-bucket/branch/master/graph/badge.svg   :target: https://codecov.io/gh/falconry/token-bucket</longdescription>
