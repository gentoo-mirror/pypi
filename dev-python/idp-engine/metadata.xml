	<longdescription>idp-engine is a reasoning engine for knowledge represented using the FO(.) language.FO(.) (aka FO-dot) is First Order logic, with various extensions to make it more expressive:  types, equality, arithmetic, inductive definitions, aggregates, and intensional objects.The idp-engine uses the Z3 SMT solver as a back-end.It is developed by the Knowledge Representation group at KU Leuven in Leuven, Belgium, and made available under the [GNU LGPL v3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt).See more information at [www.IDP-Z3.be](https://www.IDP-Z3.be).# Installation``idp_engine`` can be installed from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/), e.g. using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/):```   pip install idp_engine```# Get startedThe following code illustrates how to run inferences on a knowledge base.```    from idp_engine import IDP, model_expand    kb = IDP.parse(&quot;path/to/file.idp&quot;)    T, S = kb.get_blocks(&quot;T, S&quot;)    for model in model_expand(T,S):        print(model)```For more information, please read [the documentation](http://docs.idp-z3.be/en/latest/).# ContributeContributions are welcome!
