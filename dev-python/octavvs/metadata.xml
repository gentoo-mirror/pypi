	<longdescription># OCTAVVS: Open Chemometrics Toolbox for Analysis and Visualization of Vibrational Spectroscopy dataOCTAVVS is a set of graphical tools for high-throughput preprocessing andanalysis of vibrational spectroscopy data. Currently, the preprocessing isprimarily geared towards images from infrared absorption spectroscopy withfocal plane array detectors.There are two/three separate tools in the current version:**preprocessing** deals with atmospheric correction, resonant Mie scatteringcorrection, baseline correction and normalization.**decomposition** decomposes observed spectra into nonnegative concentrations andspectra using the MCR-ALS algorithm, performs K-means clustering on the MCR-ALSconcentrations (or on the input data), and allows the user to manually annotateclusters and export the annotated data.The decomposition tool supersedes two earlier tools:**mcr_als** decomposes observed spectra into nonnegative concentrations andspectra using the MCR-ALS algorithm.**clustering** performs K-means clustering on the concentrations inferred byMCR-ALS.## Installation on Windows, Mac or LinuxOCCTAVS needs a working Python 3 environment with various packages. Theeasiest way to get this is through the Conda package management system.Download and install the Python 3.7 (or later) version of [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).There are some platform-specific differences during installation:* On **Windows**: The default options are good (no need to have Conda modify your path).  After installation, start a Conda console (found in the Start menu).* On **Mac OS X**: The default options are good. (But _if_ you choose to notlet Conda modify your path, you can specify the full path to the commandsin the following steps.)  After installation, start Terminal.  * On **Linux**: Make the Miniconda .sh package executable and run it. When it asks aboutrunning conda init, it wants to modify your ``$PATH`` in .bashrc. This can be fine, but on someLinux distributions (notably OpenSUSE) it breaks KDE when logging in. A suggested workaroundis to change ``$PATH`` manually when needed. An alias in .bashrc can be convenient:  ``alias startconda='export PATH=~/miniconda3/bin:&quot;$PATH&quot;'``From the console, install OCTAVVS and its dependencies: ``conda install -c ctroein octavvs``## Finding and using OCTAVVSThe easiest way to access the OCTAVVS tools is through desktop shortcutswhich are created by running the ``oct_make_icons`` script from the command prompt.(We are not entirely sure if this works on all Mac OS X versions)Regardless of whether you created icons, the scripts``oct_preprocessing`` and ``oct_decomposition``can be run straight from the console (Conda console or terminal window, as described above).The location of the OCTAVVS scripts will depend on where you installed Conda.Within the Conda directory, the three scripts will be in ``bin`` whereasthe actual Python code will be located in ``lib/python3.7/site-packages/octavvs``.## Test dataTest data from two 64x64 images of _Paxillus_ hyphae growing on lignin can be[downloaded here](http://cbbp.thep.lu.se/~carl/octavvs/octavvs_test_data.zip) (zip archive, 47 MB).## Upgrading to the latest versionInformation about the most recent release of OCTAVVS can be found on its[PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/octavvs), as well as on its[Anaconda Cloud page](https://anaconda.org/ctroein/octavvs).To upgrade to the most recent version, do ``conda update -c ctroein octavvs`` in the Conda console / Terminal.Information about released versions can be found [here](https://github.com/ctroein/octavvs/blob/master/HISTORY.md).## Bug reports and code repositoryThe main project homepage is its [GitHub page](https://github.com/ctroein/octavvs),where developers can access the OCTAVVS code and submit bug reports and patches etc.Questions, bug reports and other feedback may be sent to corresponding author Carl Troein &lt;carl@thep.lu.se&gt;.## Installation through pipUsers familiar with Python could also install OCTAVVS through pip as an alternative to Anaconda,as new releases will be made to PyPI in parallel with releases to Anaconda Cloud.Note that pyqt and opencv sometimes don't work when installed through pip, depending on your system etc.</longdescription>
