	<longdescription>rcluster makes launching and accessing an R cluster on AWS simple andaccessible.This repository will:-  Create a connection to your AWS account-  Create and save an AMI with the software and configuration needed-  Allow you to launch a manager and a stated number of worker nodes,   automating the network connections between them and hosting a common   NFS-based home folder under the default ``cluster`` user:   -  &quot;/home/cluster&quot; is shared between manager and all workers   -  &quot;/home/cluster/hostfile&quot; contains the IPs of accessible worker      nodes and spare manager nodes, repeated based on the number of      available worker cores   -  ``cluster`` user's &quot;.Rprofile&quot; defines the R function      ``defaultCluster()`` that automatically reference the hostfile to      create a PSOCK-based clusterAfter that, login to RStudio Server as normal on the manager, run``defaultCluster()``, and use the returned parallel cluster object with``parLapply()`` and its peers.Getting Started===============First, you must create and save locally your AWS access key ID andsecret access key(`instructions &lt;http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html&gt;`__).Next, run ``rcluster-config`` from your command line. Note that thisfunction will, by default, write your AWS access key and secret accesskey to a hidden folder in your user directory with no additionalsecurity.There are currently three functions to launch and manage an R cluster:-  ``rcluster`` - Launch an R cluster on AWS using the default   configuration file. This function will open your default browser to   the RStudio Server login page on the manager instance once it is   live.-  ``rcluster-open`` - Access an active R cluster (opens a new tab in   your web browser to the RStudio Server instance, if available).-  ``rcluster-terminate`` - Terminate all instances associated with your   ``rcluster`` configuration.</longdescription>
