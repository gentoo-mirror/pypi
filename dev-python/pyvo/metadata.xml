It takesadvantage of VO standards to give access to thousands of catalogs,data archives, information services, and analysis tools.  It alsotakes advantage of the general capabilities of Astopy (and numpy), andso a secondary goal is to provide a development platform for migratingmore VO capabilities into Astropy.Source code can be found `on GitHub &lt;http://github.com/astropy/pyvo&gt;`_Installation and Requirements-----------------------------Releases of PyVO are available from `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvo&gt;`_thus, it and its prerequisites can be most easily installed using ``pip``:   pip install pyvoReleases are also conda packaged and available on the ``conda-forge``channel.PyVO requires Python 3.8 or later.The following packages are required for PyVO: * `astropy &lt;https://astropy.org&gt;`__ (&gt;=4.1) * `requests &lt;http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/&gt;`_The following packages are optional dependencies and are required for thefull functionality: * pillowFor running the tests, and building the documentation, the followinginfrastructure packages are required:* `pytest-astropy &lt;https://github.com/astropy/pytest-astropy&gt;`__* requests-mock* `sphinx-astropy &lt;https://github.com/astropy/sphinx-astropy&gt;`__To install from source use ``pip``:   pip install .[all]Using the developer version of PyVO in testing^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^We recommend and encourage testing against the development version of PyVO in CI,both for dependent libraries and notebook providers. As PyVO is a pure Python library, this can bedone as easily as pip installing the developer version from GitHub:   pip install git+https://github.com/astropy/pyvo.git#egg=pyvoAn example for setting up development version testing for a library as a GitHub Actions Workflow canbe found in `astroquery &lt;https://github.com/astropy/astroquery/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci_devtests.yml&gt;`__.Examples--------Many instructive examples can be found in the `PyVO Documentation &lt;http://pyvo.readthedocs.org&gt;`_.Additional examples can be found in the examples directory.Unit Tests----------PyVO uses the Astropy framework for unit tests which is built into thesetup script.  To run the tests, type:    pip install .[test]    pytestThis will run all unit tests that do not require a networkconnection.  To run all tests, including those that access thenetwork, add the --remote-data option:    pytest --remote-data</longdescription>
