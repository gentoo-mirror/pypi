It works under Python 3.It comes with a &lt;b&gt;jsonlint&lt;/b&gt; script which can be used to validateyour JSON documents for strict conformance to the JSON specification,and to detect potential data portability issues.  It can also reformator pretty-print JSON documents; either by re-indenting or removingunnecessary whitespace.What's new==========&lt;b&gt;Version 3.0.0&lt;/b&gt; will start to only work under Python 3.&lt;b&gt;Version 2.2.4&lt;/b&gt; fixes problem with jsonlint under Python 3 whentrying to reformat JSON (-f or -F options) and writing the output tostandard output.&lt;b&gt;Version 2.2.3&lt;/b&gt; fixes incorrect return values from the &quot;jsonlint&quot;command.  Also fixes a minor problem with the included unit tests incertain Python versions.&lt;b&gt;Version 2.2.2&lt;/b&gt; fixes installation problems with certain Python 3versions prior to Python 3.4.  No other changes.&lt;b&gt;Version 2.2.1&lt;/b&gt; adds an enhancement for HTML safety, and a fewobscure bug fixes.&lt;b&gt;Version 2.2&lt;/b&gt; fixes compatibility with Python 2.6 andnarrow-Unicode Pythons, fixes bugs with statistics, and adds manyenhancements to the treatment of numbers and floating-point values.&lt;b&gt;Version 2.0.1&lt;/b&gt; is a re-packaging of 2.0, after discoveringproblems with incorrect checksums in the PyPI distribution of 2.0.  Nochanges were made from 2.0.&lt;b&gt;Version 2.0&lt;/b&gt;, released 2014-05-21, is a MAJOR new version with manychanges and improvements.Visit http://nielstron.github.io/demjson3/ for complete details and documentation. Additional documentation may also be foundunder the &quot;docs/&quot; folder of the source.The biggest changes in 2.0 include:  * Now works in Python 3; minimum version supported is Python 2.6  * Much improved reporting of errors and warnings  * Extensible with user-supplied hooks  * Handles many additional Python data types automatically  * StatisticsThere are many more changes.Example use===========To use demjson3 from within your Python programs:```python    &gt;&gt;&gt; import demjson3    &gt;&gt;&gt; demjson3.encode( ['one',42,True,None] )    # From Python to JSON    '[&quot;one&quot;,42,true,null]'    &gt;&gt;&gt; demjson3.decode( '[&quot;one&quot;,42,true,null]' )  # From JSON to Python    ['one', 42, True, None]```To check a JSON data file for errors or problems:```bash    $ jsonlint my.json    my.json:1:8: Error: Numbers may not have extra leading zeros: '017'       |  At line 1, column 8, offset 8    my.json:4:10: Warning: Object contains same key more than once: 'Name'       |  At line 4, column 10, offset 49       |  Object started at line 1, column 0, offset 0 (AT-START)    my.json:9:11: Warning: Integers larger than 53-bits are not portable       |  At line 9, column 11, offset 142    my.json: has errors```Why use demjson3?================I wrote demjson3 before Python had any JSON support in its standardlibrary.  If all you need is to be able to read or write JSON data,then you may wish to just use what's built into Python.However demjson3 is extremely feature rich and is quite useful incertain applications.  It is especially good at error checkingJSON data and for being able to parse more of the JavaScript syntaxthan is permitted by strict JSON.A few advantages of demjson3 are: * It generally has better error handling and &quot;lint&quot; checking capabilities; * It will automatically use the Python Decimal (bigfloat) class   instead of a floating-point number whenever there might be an   overflow or loss of precision otherwise. * It can correctly deal with different Unicode encodings, including ASCII.   It will automatically adapt when to use \u-escapes based on the encoding. * It generates more conservative JSON, such as escaping Unicode   format control characters or line terminators, which should improve   data portability. * In non-strict mode it can also deal with slightly non-conforming   input that is more JavaScript than JSON (such as allowing comments). * It supports a broader set of Python types during conversion.Installation============To install, type:```bash   python setup.py install```or optionally just copy the file &quot;demjson3.py&quot; to whereever you want.See &quot;docs/INSTALL.txt&quot; for more detailed instructions, including howto run the self-tests.More information================See the files under the &quot;docs&quot; subdirectory.  The module is alsoself-documented, so within the python interpreter type:```python    import demjson3    help(demjson3)```or from a shell command line:```bash    pydoc demjson3```The &quot;jsonlint&quot; command script which gets installed as part of demjson3has built-in usage instructions as well.  Just type:```bash   jsonlint --help```Complete documentation and additional information is also availableon the project homepage at http://nielstron.github.io/demjson3/It is also available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) athttp://pypi.python.org/pypi/demjson3/License=======LGPLv3 - See the included &quot;LICENSE.txt&quot; file.This software is Free Software and is licensed under the terms of theGNU LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public License).  More information isfound at the top of the demjson3.py source file and the includedLICENSE.txt file.Releases prior to 1.4 were released under a different license, besure to check the corresponding LICENSE.txt file included with them.This software was written by Deron Meranda, http://deron.meranda.us/ and adjustedfor Python 3 only support by Niels MÃ¼ndler.</longdescription>
