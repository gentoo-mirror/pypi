	<longdescription># SeisCatKeep a local seismic catalog.[![PyPI-badge]][PyPI-link][![license-badge]][license-link][![docs-badge]][docs-link]Copyright (c) 2022-2023 Claudio Satriano &lt;satriano@ipgp.fr&gt;## OverviewSeisCat is a command line tool to keep a local seismic catalog.The local catalog can be used as a basis for further analyses.The seismic catalog is built and updated by querying a FDSNWS event webservice.More ways of feeding the catalog will be added in the future.The local catalog is stored in a SQLite database (single file database).üëá  See below on how to [install](#installation) and[get started](#getting-started).üìñ Check out the official documentation [here](https://seiscat.rtfd.io).## Getting StartedTo get help:    seiscat -hFirst thing to do is to generate a sample configuration file:    seiscat sampleconfigThen, edit the configuration file and init the database:    seiscat initdbTo keep the database updated, run on a regular basis:    seiscat updatedb(This will use the configuration parameter `recheck_period` to recheck thelast *n* days or hours).You can edit the attributes of specific events in the database using:    seiscat editdbYou can print the catalog to screen:    seiscat printOr plot it:    seiscat plotEach of the above commands can have its own options.As an example, to discover the options for the `plot` command, try:    seiscat plot -hSeisCat supports command line tab completion for arguments, thanks to[argcomplete](https://kislyuk.github.io/argcomplete/).To enable command line tab completion run:    activate-global-python-argcomplete(This is a one-time command that needs to be run only once).Or, alternatively, add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:    eval &quot;$(register-python-argcomplete seiscat)&quot;## Installation### Installing the latest release#### Using pip and PyPI (preferred method)The latest release of SeisCat is available on the[Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/seiscat/).You can install it easily through `pip`:    pip install seiscatTo upgrade from a previously installed version:    pip install --upgrade seiscat#### From SeisCat GitHub releasesDownload the latest release from the[releases page](https://github.com/SeismicSource/seiscat/releases),in `zip` or `tar.gz` format, then:    pip install seiscat-X.Y.zipor    pip install seiscat-X.Y.tar.gzWhere, `X.Y` is the version number (e.g., `0.1`).You don't need to uncompress the release files yourself.### Installing a developer snapshotIf you need a recent feature that is not in the latest release (see the`unreleased` section in [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)), you want to use the morerecent development snapshot from the[SeisCat GitHub repository](https://github.com/SeismicSource/seiscat).#### Using pip (preferred method)The easiest way to install the most recent development snapshot is to downloadand install it through `pip`, using its builtin `git` client:    pip install git+https://github.com/SeismicSource/seiscat.gitRun this command again, from times to times, to keep SeisCat updated withthe development version.### Cloning the SeisCat GitHub repositoryIf you want to take a look at the source code (and possibly modify it üòâ),clone the project using `git`:    git clone https://github.com/SeismicSource/seiscat.gitor, using SSH:    git clone git@github.com:SeismicSource/seiscat.git(avoid using the &quot;Download ZIP&quot; option from the green &quot;Code&quot; button, sinceversion number is lost).Then, go into the `seiscat` main directory and install the code in &quot;editablemode&quot; by running:    pip install -e .You can keep your local SeisCat repository updated by running `git pull`from times to times. Thanks to `pip`'s &quot;editable mode&quot;, you don't need toreinstall SeisCat after each update.## Getting Help / Reporting Bugs### üôè I need helpPlease open an [Issue][Issues].### üêû I found a bugPlease open an [Issue][Issues].## ContributingI'm very open to contributions: if you have new ideas, please open an[Issue][Issues].Don't hesitate sending me pull requests with new features and/or bugfixes!&lt;!-- Badges and project links --&gt;[PyPI-badge]: http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/seiscat.svg[PyPI-link]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/seiscat[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv3-green[license-link]: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html[docs-badge]: https://readthedocs.org/projects/seiscat/badge/?version=latest[docs-link]: https://seiscat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest[Issues]: https://github.com/SeismicSource/seiscat/issues</longdescription>
