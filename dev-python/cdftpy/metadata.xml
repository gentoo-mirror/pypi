At this stage of development, the codeallows to investigate the problem of ion solvation providing free energyof solvation and solvent density profiles around the ion.## Running from command line---### First steps___Running CDFT calculaton from the command line requires an input file.Simple example of what it may look like for Cl- solvation calculation is given below: ```&lt;solute&gt;#name   sigma(A)        eps(kj/mol)    charge(e)    Cl       4.83         0.05349244     -1.0      ```Once the input file has been prepared, CDFT calculation can be runusing `cdft1d` executable script as shown below ```cdft1d &lt;input_file&gt;```In this simple case, RSDFT calculation will be performed using `s2` water model. The output will contain solvation free energy as well as peakanalysis of solvent density around the ion, e.g.```....-----------------------------   Self-consistent cycle     -----------------------------iter  d_g         Free Energy 0     4.21e+00   -8.251011910    9.02e-01   -195.080061320    1.17e-02   -297.023544530    2.71e-03   -297.176892240    2.87e-06   -296.784068341    8.80e-08   -296.7836460Reached convergence, d_g &lt; 1e-07Total Free Energy               -296.783646----------------------------------Solvent density structure analysis----------------------------------O 1st peak position/height: 3.13 4.68  O 2nd peak position/height: 5.93 1.38  O 1st min position/height: 4.44 0.54    H 1st peak position/height: 2.16 8.00  H 2nd peak position/height: 4.93 1.29  H 1st min position/height: 3.26 0.37 ```Single ion solvation calculation with RSDFT flavor of CDFTcan be performed aswhere example input file for Cl- ion is given by```&lt;solute&gt;#name   sigma(A)        eps(kj/mol)    charge(e)    Cl       4.83         0.05349244     -1.0      &lt;simulation&gt;  solvent s2  method rsdft  tol 1.0E-7  max_iter 200  output_rate 10  rcoul 1.25  rmax 100```The output will contain solvation free energy as well as peakanalysis of solvent density around the ion, e.g.```...-----------------------------   Self-consistent cycle     -----------------------------iter  d_g         Free Energy 0     1.13e+00   -258.875223910    4.14e+01   -4839.564802920    9.29e-02   -292.744795930    1.53e-03   -301.958893940    7.17e-05   -301.573446450    2.65e-07   -301.565321353    9.82e-08   -301.5653695Reached convergence, d_g &lt; 1e-07Total Free Energy               -301.565369 kj/mol----------------------------------Solvent density structure analysis----------------------------------O 1st peak position/height: 3.12 4.785  O 2nd peak position/height: 5.91 1.384  O 1st min position/height: 4.43 0.543    H 1st peak position/height: 2.15 8.291  H 2nd peak position/height: 4.92 1.301  H 1st min position/height: 3.24 0.359  ```The same calculation but with RISM methodologycan be run as    cdft1d -m rism INPUT_FILE___### Calculation options___There are number options that may be used with `cdft1d`. The complete listof those can be displayed by running```cdft1d --help```The choice of the calculation method, as mentioned earlier, is affected through `-m` option, which will default to RSDFT calculation. The choice of solvent is controlled by `-s` option, with default being the `s2` model. For example, the use of  `hcl` solvent can accomplished by```cdft1d -s hcl INPUT_FILE```To examine calculation results in greater detail, we can use `-d` option.Used by itself ```cdft1d -d INPUT_FILE```it will open interactive dashboard in the dafault browser, where one can interactively examine solvent density profiles, solute-solvent potential of mean force, and solvent electrostatic potentials. Alternatively, the dashboard can be saved to html file (e.g. analysis.html)```cdft1d -d analysis.html INPUT_FILE```which can be opened at a later point. The content ofdashboard will depend on the type of the calculation. For example, forsingle ion solvation calculation it will look like **[this](https://opencdft.github.io/cl.html)** and for multipleparameter calculation as **[this](https://opencdft.github.io/charging.html)**___## References___G.N.
