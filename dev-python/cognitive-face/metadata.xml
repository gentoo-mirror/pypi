You can get one [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/?api=face-api).1. Copy `cognitive_face/tests/config.sample.py`  into `cognitive_face/tests/config.py`.1. Change the `KEY` and `BASE_URL` parameters to your own subscription's API key and endpoint.1. Run the following:```bashpython setup.py test```## Running the sampleA sample desktop application is also provided.Currently it support the following combination of prerequisites:1. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) + [wxPython 4](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wxPython) **[Recommended]**1. [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/) + [wxPython 4](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wxPython)1. [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/) + [wxPython 3](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/3.0.2.0/)P.S. WxPython 3 does not support Python 3 by design.Then run the following:```bashgit clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Face-Python.gitcd Cognitive-Face-Pythonpip install -r requirements.txtpython sample```![Sample app](./Assets/sample_screenshot.png)## ContributingWe welcome contributions.
