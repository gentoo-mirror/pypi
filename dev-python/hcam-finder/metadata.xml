Note::        Creating a finding chart and instrument setup for the above instruments are more        tightly connected than is usually the case with CCD imagers. To avoid errors in        phase II setups, you **must** use the tools above to generate finding charts. By         doing so, and reading the instrument-specific documentation below, you will avoid        the non-optimal phase II setups that arise from a lack of awareness of the peculiarities        of imagers designed for high time resolution.``hcam_finder`` is written in Python and is based on TKinter. It should be compatiblewith Python2 and Python3.Installation------------The software is written as much as possible to make use of core Pythoncomponents. It requires my own `hcam_widgets &lt;https://github.com/HiPERCAM/hcam_widgets&gt;`_ module.It also relies on the third party libraries `astropy &lt;http://astropy.org/&gt;`_ for astronomicalcalculations and catalog lookup, as well as `ginga &lt;https://ginga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_ forimage display. Optionally, you can also use `astroquery &lt;https://astroquery.readthedocs.io&gt;`_ to expandthe range of surveys one can download images from.Installing using ``pip`` should take care of these dependencies. Simply install with:: pip install hcam_finderor if you don't have root access:: sudo pip install hcam_finderor:: pip install --user hcam_finder* Free software: MIT license* Documentation: https://hcam-finder.readthedocs.io.=======History=======0.1.0 (2017-02-11)------------------* First release on PyPI.</longdescription>
