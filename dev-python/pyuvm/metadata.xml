	<longdescription># PyUVM## Description**pyuvm** is the Universal Verification Methodology implemented in Python instead of SystemVerilog. **pyuvm** uses cocotb to interact with the simulator and schedule simulation events.**pyuvm** implements the most often-used parts of the UVM while taking advantage of the fact that Python does not have strict typing and does not require parameterized classes. The project refactors pieces of the UVM that were either overly complicated due to typing or legacy code.The code is based in the IEEE 1800.2 specification and most classes and methods have the specification references in the comments.The following IEEE 1800.2 sections have been implemented:|Section|Name|Description||-------|----|-----------||5|Base Classes|uvm_object does not capture transaction timing information||6|Reporting Classes|Leverages logging, controlled using UVM hierarchy||8|Factory Classes|All uvm_void classes automatically registered||9|Phasing|Simplified to only common phases. Supports objection system||12|UVM TLM Interfaces|Fully implemented||13|Predefined Component Classes|Implements uvm_component with hierarchy, uvm_root singleton,run_test(), simplified ConfigDB, uvm_driver, etc||14 &amp; 15|Sequences, sequencer, sequence_item|Refactored sequencer functionality leveraging Python language capabilities. Simpler and more direct implementation|### InstallationYou can install **pyuvm** using `pip`. This will also install **cocotb** as a requirement for **pyuvm**.```bash% pip install pyuvm```Then you can run a simple test:```bash% python&gt;&gt;&gt; from pyuvm import *&gt;&gt;&gt; my_object = uvm_object(&quot;my_object&quot;)&gt;&gt;&gt; type(my_object)&lt;class 's05_base_classes.uvm_object'&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;object name:&quot;, my_object.get_name())object name: my_object```### Running from the repositoryYou can run pyuvm from a cloned repository by installing the cloned repository using pip.```bash% cd &lt;pyuvm repo directory&gt;% pip install -e .```## UsageThis section demonstrates running an example simulation and then shows how the example has been put together demonstrating what the UVM looks like in Python.### Running the simulationThe TinyALU is, as its name implies, a tiny ALU. It has four operations: ADD, AND, NOT, and MUL. This example shows us running the Verilog version of the design, but there is also a VHDL version.**cocotb** uses a Makefile to run its simulation. We see it in `examples/TinyALU`:```makefileCWD=$(shell pwd)COCOTB_REDUCED_LOG_FMT = TrueSIM ?= icarusVERILOG_SOURCES =$(CWD)/hdl/verilog/tinyalu.svMODULE := testbenchTOPLEVEL=tinyaluTOPLEVEL_LANG=verilogCOCOTB_HDL_TIMEUNIT=1usCOCOTB_HDL_TIMEPRECISION=1usinclude $(shell cocotb-config --makefiles)/Makefile.sim```You can learn more about the Makefile targets at [cocotb.org](https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/building.html).  The `cocotb-config` command on the last line points to the **cocotb** Makefile locations and launches the `sim` target.Modify the `SIM` variable to match your simulator. All the simulator types are in `cocotb/share/makefiles/simulators/makefile.$(SIM)`.You should be able to run the simulation like this:```bash% cd &lt;path&gt;/pyuvm/examples/TinyALU% make sim```**cocotb** will present a lot of messages, but in the middle of them you will see these UVM messages. It runs four examples with one for each command with randomized operands.```text250000.00ns INFO     testbench.py(209)[uvm_test_top.env.scoreboard]: PASSED: 0x34 ADD 0x23 = 0x0057250000.00ns INFO     testbench.py(209)[uvm_test_top.env.scoreboard]: PASSED: 0xf9 AND 0x29 = 0x0029250000.00ns INFO     testbench.py(209)[uvm_test_top.env.scoreboard]: PASSED: 0x71 XOR 0x01 = 0x0070250000.00ns INFO     testbench.py(209)[uvm_test_top.env.scoreboard]: PASSED: 0xb8 MUL 0x47 = 0x3308250000.00ns INFO     testbench.py(209)[uvm_test_top.env.scoreboard]: PASSED: 0xff ADD 0xff = 0x01fe250000.00ns INFO     testbench.py(209)[uvm_test_top.env.scoreboard]: PASSED: 0xff AND 0xff = 0x00ff250000.00ns INFO     testbench.py(209)[uvm_test_top.env.scoreboard]: PASSED: 0xff XOR 0xff = 0x0000250000.00ns INFO     testbench.py(209)[uvm_test_top.env.scoreboard]: PASSED: 0xff MUL 0xff = 0xfe01```## The `TinyAluBfm` in `tinyalu_utils.py`The `TinyAluBfm` is a singleton that uses **cocotb** to communicate with the TinyALU.  The BFM exposes three coroutines to the user: `send_op()`, `get_cmd()`, and `get_result()`.The singleton uses the `cocotb.top` variable to get the handle to the DUT.  This is the handle that we normally pass to a `cocotb.test()` coroutine.The `TinyAluBfm` is defined in `tinyalu_utils.py` and imported into our testbench.## The `pyuvm` testbenchThe `testbench.py` contains the entire UVM testbench and connects to the TinyALU through a `TinyAluBfm` object defined in `tinyalu_utils.py`.  We'll examine the `testbench.py` file and enough of the **cocotb** test too run the simlation### Importing `pyuvm`Testbenches written in the SystemVerilog UVM usually import the package like this:```systemverilogimport uvm_pkg::*;```This gives you access to the class names without needing a package path.  To getsimilar behavior with `pyuvm` us the `from` import syntax. We import `pyuvm` to distinguish the `@pyuvm.test()` decorator from the `@cocotb.test()` decorator:```pythonimport pyuvmfrom pyuvm import *```### The AluTest classesWe're going to examine the UVM classes from the top, the test, to the bottom, the sequences.**pyuvm** names the UVM classes as they are named in the specification. Therefore **pyvu use underscore naming as is done in SystemVerilog and not camel-casing.We extend `uvm_test` to create the `AluTest`, using camel-casing in our code even if **pyuvm** does not use it:You'll see the following in the test:* We define a class that extends `uvm_test`.* We use the `@pyuvm.test()` decorator to notify **cocotb** that this is a test.* There is no `uvm_component_utils()` macro. **pyuvm** automatically registers classes that extend `uvm_void` with the factory.* The phases do not have a `phase` variable. Phasing has been refactored to support only the *common phases* as described in the specification.* We create the environment using the `create()` method and the factory. Notice that `create()` is now a simple class method. There is no typing-driven incantation.* `raise_objection()` is now a `uvm_component` method. There is no longer a `phase` variable.* The `ConfigDB()` singleton acts the same way as the `uvm_config_db` interface in the SystemVerilog UVM. **pyuvm** refactored away the `uvm_resource_db` as there are no issues with classes to manage.* **pyuvm** leverages the Python logging system and does not implement the UVM reporting system. Every descendent of `uvm_report_object` has a `logger` data member.* Sequences work as they do in the SystemVerilog UVM.```python@pyuvm.test()class AluTest(uvm_test):    def build_phase(self):        self.env = AluEnv(&quot;env&quot;, self)    def end_of_elaboration_phase(self):        self.test_all = TestAllSeq.create(&quot;test_all&quot;)    async def run_phase(self):        self.raise_objection()        await self.test_all.start()        self.drop_objection()```We extend the `AluTest` class to create a parallel version of the test and a Fibonacci program. You can find these sequences in `testbench.py````python@pyuvm.test()class ParallelTest(AluTest):    def build_phase(self):        uvm_factory().set_type_override_by_type(TestAllSeq, TestAllForkSeq)        super().build_phase()@pyuvm.test()class FibonacciTest(AluTest):    def build_phase(self):        ConfigDB().set(None, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;DISABLE_COVERAGE_ERRORS&quot;, True)        uvm_factory().set_type_override_by_type(TestAllSeq, FibonacciSeq)        return super().build_phase()```All the familiar pieces of a UVM testbench are in **pyuvm**.### The ALUEnv ClassThe `uvm_env` class is a container for the components that make up the testbench.  There are four component classes instantiated:* `Monitor`—There are actually two monitors instantiated, one to monitor commands (`self.cmd_mod`) and the other to monitor results (`self.result_mon`).  The `Monitor` code is the same for both. We pass them the name of the proxy function that gets the data they monitor.* `Scoreboard`—The scoreboard gathers all the commands and results and compares predicted results to actual results.* `Coverage`—The coverage class checks that we've covered all the kinds of operations and issues an error if we did not.* `Driver`—This `uvm_driver` processes sequences items.* `uvm_sequencer`—The `uvm_sequencer` queues sequence items and passes them to the `Driver`* We store `self.seqr` in the `ConfigDB()` so test can get it as we see above.The `AluEnv` creates all these components in `build_phase()` and connects the exports to the ports in `connect_phase()`. The `build_phase()` is a top-down phase and the `connect_phase()` is a bottom up phase.```pythonclass AluEnv(uvm_env):    def build_phase(self):        self.seqr = uvm_sequencer(&quot;seqr&quot;, self)        ConfigDB().set(None, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;SEQR&quot;, self.seqr)        self.driver = Driver.create(&quot;driver&quot;, self)        self.cmd_mon = Monitor(&quot;cmd_mon&quot;, self, &quot;get_cmd&quot;)        self.coverage = Coverage(&quot;coverage&quot;, self)        self.scoreboard = Scoreboard(&quot;scoreboard&quot;, self)    def connect_phase(self):        self.driver.seq_item_port.connect(self.seqr.seq_item_export)        self.cmd_mon.ap.connect(self.scoreboard.cmd_export)        self.cmd_mon.ap.connect(self.coverage.analysis_export)        self.driver.ap.connect(self.scoreboard.result_export)```### The MonitorThe `Monitor` extends `uvm_component`. Takes the name of a `CocotProxy` method name as an argument.  It uses the name to find the method in the proxy and then calls the method. You cannot do this in SystemVerilog as there is no introspection.The `Monitor` creates an analysis port and writes the data it gets into the analysis port.Notice in the `run_phase()` we use the `await` keyword to wait for the `get_cmd` coroutine.  Unlike SystemVerilog, Python makes it clear when you are calling a time-consuming task vs a function. Also notice that the `run_phase()` has the `async` keyword to designate that it is a coroutine. (A task in SystemVerilog.)```pythonclass Monitor(uvm_component):    def __init__(self, name, parent, method_name):        super().__init__(name, parent)        self.method_name = method_name    def build_phase(self):        self.ap = uvm_analysis_port(&quot;ap&quot;, self)        self.bfm = TinyAluBfm()        self.get_method = getattr(self.bfm, self.method_name)    async def run_phase(self):        while True:            datum = await self.get_method()            self.logger.debug(f&quot;MONITORED {datum}&quot;)            self.ap.write(datum)```### The ScoreboardThe scoreboard receives commands from the command monitor and results from the results monitor in the same order.  It uses the commands to predict the results and compares them.* The `build_phase` uses `uvm_tlm_analysis_fifos` to receive data from the monitors and store it.* The scoreboard exposes the FIFO exports by copying them into class data members.  As we see in the environment above, this allows us to connect the exports without reaching into the `Scoreboard's` inner workings.* We connect the exports in the `connect_phase()`* The `check_phase()` runs after the `run_phase()`.  At this point the scoreboard has all operations and results. It loops through the operations and predicts the result, then it compares the predicted and actual result.* Notice that we do not use UVM reporting. Instead we us the Python `logging` module. Every `uvm_report_object` and its children has its own logger stored in `self.logger.````pythonclass Scoreboard(uvm_component):    def build_phase(self):        self.cmd_fifo = uvm_tlm_analysis_fifo(&quot;cmd_fifo&quot;, self)        self.result_fifo = uvm_tlm_analysis_fifo(&quot;result_fifo&quot;, self)        self.cmd_get_port = uvm_get_port(&quot;cmd_get_port&quot;, self)        self.result_get_port = uvm_get_port(&quot;result_get_port&quot;, self)        self.cmd_export = self.cmd_fifo.analysis_export        self.result_export = self.result_fifo.analysis_export    def connect_phase(self):        self.cmd_get_port.connect(self.cmd_fifo.get_export)        self.result_get_port.connect(self.result_fifo.get_export)    def check_phase(self):        while self.result_get_port.can_get():            _, actual_result = self.result_get_port.try_get()            cmd_success, cmd = self.cmd_get_port.try_get()            if not cmd_success:                self.logger.critical(f&quot;result {actual_result} had no command&quot;)            else:                (A, B, op_numb) = cmd                op = Ops(op_numb)                predicted_result = alu_prediction(A, B, op)                if predicted_result == actual_result:                    self.logger.info(f&quot;PASSED: 0x{A:02x} {op.name} 0x{B:02x} =&quot;                                     f&quot; 0x{actual_result:04x}&quot;)                else:                    self.logger.error(f&quot;FAILED: 0x{A:02x} {op.name} 0x{B:02x} &quot;                                      f&quot;= 0x{actual_result:04x} &quot;                                      f&quot;expected 0x{predicted_result:04x}&quot;)```### CoverageThe `Coverage` Class extends `uvm_subscriber` which extends `uvm_analysis_export`.  As we see in the `AluEnv` above, this allows us to pass the object directly to the `connect()` method to connect it to an analysis port.The `Coverage` Class overrides the `write()` method expected of a `uvm_subscriber`. If it didn't you'd get a runtime error.  The `Coverage` class uses a set to store all the operations seen. Then it subtracts that from the set of all operations. If the result has a length longer than `0` it issues an error.Since this tesbench loops through all the operations you will not see this error.```pythonclass Coverage(uvm_subscriber):    def end_of_elaboration_phase(self):        self.cvg = set()    def write(self, cmd):        (_, _, op) = cmd        self.cvg.add(op)    def report_phase(self):        try:            disable_errors = ConfigDB().get(                self, &quot;&quot;, &quot;DISABLE_COVERAGE_ERRORS&quot;)        except UVMConfigItemNotFound:            disable_errors = False        if not disable_errors:            if len(set(Ops) - self.cvg) &gt; 0:                self.logger.error(                    f&quot;Functional coverage error. Missed: {set(Ops)-self.cvg}&quot;)                assert False            else:                self.logger.info(&quot;Covered all operations&quot;)                assert True```### DriverThe `Driver` extends `uvm_driver` and so it works with sequences and sequence items.The `connect_phase()` gets the proxy from the `ConfigDB()` and the `run_phase()` uses it to get items and process them by calling `send_op`.  We use `while True` because we do this forever. **cocotb** will shut down the `run_phase` coroutine at the end of simulation.```pythonclass Driver(uvm_driver):    def build_phase(self):        self.ap = uvm_analysis_port(&quot;ap&quot;, self)    def start_of_simulation_phase(self):        self.bfm = TinyAluBfm()    async def launch_tb(self):        await self.bfm.reset()        self.bfm.start_tasks()    async def run_phase(self):        await self.launch_tb()        while True:            cmd = await self.seq_item_port.get_next_item()            await self.bfm.send_op(cmd.A, cmd.B, cmd.op)            result = await self.bfm.get_result()            self.ap.write(result)            cmd.result = result            self.seq_item_port.item_done()```### The ALU SequenceThe ALU Sequence creates sequence items, randomizes them and sends them to the `Driver`. It inherits `start_item` and `finish_item` from `uvm_sequence`.It is clear that `start_item` and `finish_item` block because we call them using the `await` keyword.  `start_item` waits for it's turn to use the sequencer, and `finish_item` sends the sequence_item to the driver and returns when the driver calls `item_done()````pythonclass TestAllSeq(uvm_sequence):    async def body(self):        seqr = ConfigDB().get(None, &quot;&quot;, &quot;SEQR&quot;)        random = RandomSeq(&quot;random&quot;)        max = MaxSeq(&quot;max&quot;)        await random.start(seqr)        await max.start(seqr)```This virtual sequence launches two other sequences: `RandomSeq` and `MaxSeq`. `RandomSeq` randomizes the operands.```pythonclass RandomSeq(uvm_sequence):    async def body(self):        for op in list(Ops):            cmd_tr = AluSeqItem(&quot;cmd_tr&quot;, None, None, op)            await self.start_item(cmd_tr)            cmd_tr.randomize_operands()            await self.finish_item(cmd_tr)````MaxSeq` sets the operands to `0xff`:```pythonclass MaxSeq(uvm_sequence):    async def body(self):        for op in list(Ops):            cmd_tr = AluSeqItem(&quot;cmd_tr&quot;, 0xff, 0xff, op)            await self.start_item(cmd_tr)            await self.finish_item(cmd_tr)```### ALU Sequence ItemThe `AluSeqItem` contains the TinyALU commands.  It has two operands and an operation.The SystemVerilog `uvm_sequence_item` class uses `convert2string()` to convert the item to a string and `do_compare()` to compare the item to another item.  We do not use these in **pyuvm** because Python has magic methods that do these functions.`__eq__()`—This does the same thing as `do_compare()` It returns `True` if the items are equal.  This method works with the `==` operator.`__str__()`—This does the same thing as `convert2string()`.  It returns a string version of the item. The `print` function calls this method automatically.```pythonclass AluSeqItem(uvm_sequence_item):    def __init__(self, name, aa, bb, op):        super().__init__(name)        self.A = aa        self.B = bb        self.op = Ops(op)    def randomize_operands(self):        self.A = random.randint(0, 255)        self.B = random.randint(0, 255)    def randomize(self):        self.randomize_operands()        self.op = random.choice(list(Ops))    def __eq__(self, other):        same = self.A == other.A and self.B == other.B and self.op == other.op        return same    def __str__(self):        return f&quot;{self.get_name()} : A: 0x{self.A:02x} \        OP: {self.op.name} ({self.op.value}) B: 0x{self.B:02x}&quot;```Now that we've got the UVM testbench we can call it from a **cocotb** test.## The Cocotb Tests**cocotb** finds `uvm_test` classes identified with the `@pyuvm.test()` decorator and launches them as coroutines.  Our test does the following:## ContributingYou can contribute to `pyuvm` by forking this repository and submitting pull requests.The repository runs all needed tests using `tox`.  The test runs`flake8` and fails if that linter finds any issues.  Visual Studio Codecan be set up to automatically check `flake8` issues.  The repositoryignores F403 and F405 issues from `flake8`.There are three sets of `pytest` tests that test features thatdon't use coroutines.  The rest of the tests are in `tests/cocotb_tests`and need a simulator to run.Credits:* Ray Salemi—Original author, created as an employee of Siemens.* IEEE 1800.2 Specification* Siemens for supporting me in this effort.## LicenseCopyright 2020 Siemens EDALicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;);you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.You may obtain a copy of the License at[http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, softwaredistributed under the License is distributed on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.See the License for the specific language governing permissions andlimitations under the License.</longdescription>
