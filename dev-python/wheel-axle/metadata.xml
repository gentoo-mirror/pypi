THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.ADDITIONAL INCLUDED DISCLAIMERS ALSO APPLY.**Wheel-Axle (`Axle`, `bdist_axle`) is a drop-in replacement/augmentation utility for `wheel` (`bdist_wheel`)that extends and builds spec-compliant wheels.During the build, `Axle` is able to capture and record symlinks in the following schema paths (locations):* purelib* platlib* scripts* headers* dataAdditionally, `Axle` is able to customize the tags via additional command line options.While the generated wheel is fully spec-compliant, additional symlinks functionality is not possible without itscompanion library [Wheel Axle Runtime](https://github.com/karellen/wheel-axle-runtime). Thus, every wheel generated bythe `bdist_axle` automatically becomes dependent on `wheel-axle-runtime` that provides post-install logic required.## ImplementationThe body of the library is as ugly and messy as `distutils`/`setuptools` are, and consists of, mainly, inhacking/overwriting various `setuptools` commands to detect, handle and record symlinks and their targets. Once thatproblem is solved, the list of symlinks is recorded in the `.dist-info/symlinks.txt`in the following CSV format:1. symlink name2. symlink target3. a boolean (0 or 1) flag indicating whether the target is a directory**NOTE: Symlinks may be relative, absolute and/or broken. Symlink targets are recorded verbatim (even when broken) andare NOT otherwise interpreted. THIS IS INTENTIONAL. Pleasesee [Wheel Axle Runtime Security Notice](https://github.com/karellen/wheel-axle-runtime#security)for additional information.**A special `&lt;distribution name and version&gt;.pth` file is also added to the distribution. When the wheel is installedthis `.pth` file triggers the post-install logic via[wheel-axle-runtime](https://github.com/karellen/wheel-axle-runtime).## Usage`python setup.py bdist_wheel &lt;arguments&gt;` can be replaced with `python setup.py bdist_axle &lt;arguments&gt;`. The replacementis drop-in.Additional functionality is available via the following options:```commandline  --root-is-pure    set to manually override whether the wheel is                    pure (default: None)  --abi-tag         set to override ABI tag (default: None)```Using `--python-tag`, `--root-is-pure` and `--abi-tag` allows you to create wheels that carry platform-dependent datawhile otherwise containing pure-Python libraries.</longdescription>
