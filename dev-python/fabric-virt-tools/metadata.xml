	<longdescription># virt-toolsLibvirt based tools to tune VMs on the worker nodes. It provides CLI interface as well as Python APIs.## CLI`virt-tools` supports the CLI: `fabric-virt-tools-cli````Usage: fabric-virt-tools-cli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...Options:  -v, --verbose  --help         Show this message and exit.Commands:  cpu   CPU Pinning  numa  Numa Tuning```### CPU Pinning and Information`fabric-virt-tools-cli` supports CPU pinning and information commands as depicted below:```Usage: fabric-virt-tools-cli cpu [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...  CPU PinningOptions:  --help  Show this message and exit.Commands:  info  Query CPU Info for VM Guest and relevant host information as well  pin   Pin vCPU to Host CPU```### Numa Pinning and Information`fabric-virt-tools-cli` supports Numa pinning and information commands as depicted below:```Usage: fabric-virt-tools-cli numa [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...  Numa TuningOptions:  --help  Show this message and exit.Commands:  info  Query Numa Info for VM Guest and relevant host information as well  tune  Pin Numa Node to the VM Guest```## InstallationThis tool should be installed on the Worker nodes on each site. This CLI is used by the AMHandlers to pin CPU/Numa to the VM instances.```$ p3.6 install fabric-virt-tools```NOTE: This package depends on `libvirt-python`. `libvirt` running on the currently uses `python3.6` hence `pip3.6` install is recommended. This can be changed if the underlying platform i.e. `libvirt` uses a later version of `python`.### Pre-requisitesEnsure that following are installed```virtualenvvirtualenvwrapper```NOTE: Any of the virtual environment tools (`venv`, `virtualenv`, or `virtualenvwrapper`) should work.</longdescription>
