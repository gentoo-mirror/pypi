Copyright (C) 2022 SecureAuth Corporation. All rights reserved.Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with networkprotocols. Impacket is focused on providing low-levelprogrammatic access to the packets and for some protocols (e.g.SMB1-3 and MSRPC) the protocol implementation itself.Packets can be constructed from scratch, as well as parsed from raw data, and the object-oriented API makes it simple to work with deep hierarchies of protocols. The library provides a set of toolsas examples of what can be done within the context of this library.A description of some of the tools can be found at[SecureAuth Labs' Open Source Website](https://www.secureauth.com/labs/open-source-tools/impacket).What protocols are featured?---------------------------- * Ethernet, Linux &quot;Cooked&quot; capture. * IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP, ARP. * IPv4 and IPv6 Support. * NMB and SMB1, SMB2 and SMB3 (high-level implementations). * MSRPC version 5, over different transports: TCP, SMB/TCP, SMB/NetBIOS and HTTP. * Plain, NTLM and Kerberos authentications, using password/hashes/tickets/keys. * Portions/full implementation of the following MSRPC interfaces: EPM, DTYPES, LSAD, LSAT, NRPC, RRP, SAMR, SRVS, WKST, SCMR, BKRP, DHCPM, EVEN6, MGMT, SASEC, TSCH, DCOM, WMI, OXABREF, NSPI, OXNSPI. * Portions of TDS (MSSQL) and LDAP protocol implementations.
