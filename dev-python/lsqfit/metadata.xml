	<longdescription>lsqfit------This package facilitates least-squares fitting of noisy data bymulti-dimensional, nonlinear functions of arbitrarily many parameters.``lsqfit`` supports Bayesian priors for the fit parameters, with arbitrarilycomplicated multidimensional Gaussian distributions. A tutorial on fitting isincluded in the documentation; documentation is in the ``doc/``subdirectory: see ``doc/html/index.html`` or &lt;https://lsqfit.readthedocs.io&gt;.The fitter uses automatic differentiation to compute gradients of the fitfunction. This greatly simplifies coding of the fit function since only thefunction itself need be coded. Coding is also simplified by using dictionaries(instead of arrays) for representing fit data and fit priors.``lsqfit`` makes heavy use of Python package ``gvar``, whichsimplifies the analysis of error propagation and the creation ofmulti-dimensional Gaussian distributions (for fit priors).This code has been used on a laptop to fit functions of tens-to-thousands ofparameters to tens-to-thousands of pieces of data.  ``lsqfit`` uses the GNUScientific Library (GSL) and/or ``scipy`` to do the fitting, ``numpy`` forefficient array arithmetic, and ``cython`` to compile efficient code thatinterfaces between Python and the C-based GSL.Information on how to install the components is in the ``INSTALLATION`` file.To test the libraries try ``make tests``. Some examples are give in the``examples/`` subdirectory.Version numbers: Incompatible changes are signaled by incrementingthe ``major`` version number, where version numbers have the form``major.minor.patch``. The ``minor`` number signals new features, and the``patch`` number bug fixes.| Created by G. Peter Lepage (Cornell University) 2008| Copyright (c) 2008-2021 G.
