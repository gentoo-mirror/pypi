Key to our success are the gcdt CLI tools we use tosuccessfully complete &gt;3000 deployments per month to AWS. Over thecourse of the last 18 months we built gcdt ourselves using Python.|Gartner Award|Features include:-  Infrastructure-as-code-  Cloud infrastructure (kumo &amp; tenkai)-  Serverless infrastructure (ramuda &amp; yugen)-  Scaffolding-  Powerful plugin mechanism-  Service integration (Slack, Datadog, ...)-  Codify infrastructure best practices-  Multi-Env support (dev, stage, prod, ...)At glomex we love ``continuous-integration-as-code`` and``infrastructure-as-code``. This enables us to move fast while providingservices of high quality and resilience to our partners.We added a plugin mechanism to gcdt so we can specialize gcdt to highlyoptimized and opinionated environments that resonate with our usecases.We hope gcdt will be helpful to you, too. At glomex we believe that onlyopen source software can become truly great software.Why gcdt?---------You can do everything gcdt does by using the AWS Management Console sowhy use gcdt? Basically, because using GUI interfaces to drive yourproduction environment is a really bad idea. You can't really automateGUI interfaces, you can't debug GUI interfaces, and you can't easilyshare techniques and best practices with a GUI.The goal of gcdt is to put everything about your AWS infrastructure intofiles on a filesystem which can be easily versioned and shared. Onceyour files are in git, people on your team can create pull requests tomerge new changes in and those pull requests can be reviewed, commentedon, and eventually approved. This is a tried and proven approach thathas worked for more traditional deployment methodologies and will alsowork for your infrastructure on AWS.Useful gcdt information------------------------  `gcdt\_userguide &lt;http://gcdt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`__-  `gcdt issues &lt;https://github.com/glomex/gcdt/issues&gt;`__-  `gcdt project board &lt;https://github.com/glomex/gcdt/projects/1&gt;`__Installation------------Follow the`instructions &lt;http://gcdt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/07_installation.html&gt;`__to install ``gcdt``Contributing------------Here you can find the full guide for`contributing &lt;http://gcdt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/70_development.html&gt;`__At glomex we welcome feedback, bug reports, and pull requests!For pull requests, please stick to the following guidelines:-  Add tests for any new features and bug fixes.
