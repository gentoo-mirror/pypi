	<longdescription>Introduction-----------------------------------------------FloPy includes support for MODFLOW 6, MODFLOW-2005, MODFLOW-NWT, MODFLOW-USG, and MODFLOW-2000. Other supported MODFLOW-based models include MODPATH (version 6 and 7), MT3DMS, MT3D-USGS, and SEAWAT.For general modeling issues, please consult a modeling forum, such as the [MODFLOW Users Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/modflow).  Other MODFLOW resources are listed in the [MODFLOW Resources](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy#modflow-resources) section.Documentation-----------------------------------------------Documentation is available on [Read the Docs](https://flopy.readthedocs.io)and includes information on FloPy; tutorials for using FloPy with MODFLOW 6and previous versions of MODFLOW, MT3DMS, MT3D-USGS, MODPATH, and ZONEBUDGET;and code documentation.Contributing------------------------------------------------Bug reports, code contributions, or improvements to the documentation are welcome from the community. Prior to contributing, please read up on our guidelines for [contributing](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) and then check out one of our issues in the [hotlist: community-help](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/labels/hotlist%3A%20community%20help).How to Cite-----------------------------------------------*Citation for FloPy:*[Bakker, Mark, Post, Vincent, Langevin, C.
