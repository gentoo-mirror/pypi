	<longdescription>xattr-----xattr is a Python wrapper for extended filesystem attributes.xattr also ships with an `xattr` command line tool for viewing andediting extended filesystem attributes. On platforms that support orship with the attr package, you may prefer to use the `getfattr`and `setfattr` command line tools from the attr package.Extended attributes extend the basic attributes of files and directoriesin the file system.  They are stored as name:data pairs associated withfile system objects (files, directories, symlinks, etc).Extended attributes are currently only available on Darwin 8.0+ (Mac OS X 10.4)and Linux 2.6+. Experimental support is included for Solaris and FreeBSD.Python 3.8+ is required as of v1.0.0, and this is the minimum versionthat is compatible with Python 3.12+.Versions older than v1.0.0 are no longer supported, but areavailable for use. v0.10.1 is the last version to support older versionsof Python (including 2.7).Note: On Linux, custom xattr keys need to be prefixed with the `user`namespace, ie: `user.your_attr`.Note: If you need to read or write Spotlight metadata attributes on macOS,see osxmetadata_ which provides a native macOS means to do so withoutdirectly manipulating extended attributes. osxmetadata also provides accessto other macOS metadata attributes and extended attributes via xattr... _osxmetadata: https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxmetadata</longdescription>
