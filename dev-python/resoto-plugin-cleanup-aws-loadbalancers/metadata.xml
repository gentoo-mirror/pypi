	<longdescription># resoto-plugin-cleanup-aws-loadbalancersAWS Loadbalancers Cleanup Plugin for ResotoThis plugin cleans up AWS ALB/ELB load balancers with no instances attached to them.## Usage```plugin_cleanup_aws_loadbalancers:  # Enable plugin?  enabled: false  # Minimum age of unused load balancers to cleanup  min_age: '7 days'```The default load balancer age is 7 days. Meaning if a load balancer is more than 7 days old and does not have any instances/backends attached it will be flagged for cleanup.Optionally change the age cutoff value using the `min_age` option.Example of valid age units:```weeksdayshoursminutes```Each of them can be abbreviated down to one letter. E.g. `7d`, `24h`, `60m`, etc. A space in between the numeric and the unit is optional, meaning `7d` and `7 days` are equivalent.</longdescription>
