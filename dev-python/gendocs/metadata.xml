Check out one of the following projects which use ``gendocs``:- `PVGeo`_: A Python package for visualizing geophysical data in VTK and ParaView- `ESPA Tools`_: A Python package for simple loading of Landsat imagery as NumPy arrays.. _ESPA Tools: https://espatools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.. _PVGeo: http://docs.pvgeo.orgGet Started-----------Install ``gendocs`` from PyPI:.. code-block:: bash    $ pip install gendocsCookiecutter^^^^^^^^^^^^Want to easily create a new project that will build its own documentation?Try the ``gendocs`` Cookiecutter which will prompt you for your new project'sdetails and create all the needed file structures for your new, automaticallydocumented Python package.To create a new project, make sure you have Cookiecutter_ installed in yourvirtual environment:.. _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. code-block:: bash$ pip install cookiecutterNow you can use `our Cookiecutter template`_ to create a new project readyfor ``gendocs`` by executing the following command and following the prompts:.. _our Cookiecutter template: https://github.com/banesullivan/cookiecutter-gendocs.. code-block:: bash    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/banesullivan/cookiecutter-gendocs.gitThat's it! Now you have a new Python project ready for automatic documentationand deployment.Usage^^^^^Already have a Python package in need of automatic documentation? Follow these steps.This generator is built for Sphinx (RST) documentation.To document your package, setup sphinx and a ``conf.py`` then add the followingsomewhere near the top of your ``conf.py``:.. code-block:: python    # Import the package to document:    import wonderfulpackage    # Automatically generate documentation pages    from gendocs import Generator    Generator().DocumentPackages(wonderfulpackage)That's it! That code block above is all you need to do to document your package(s) thoroughly. Now you can build the Sphinx documentation, and all docs pages will be automatically generated... admonition:: Remove the `Edit on GitHub` Button   :class: warning    Be sure to remove the `Edit on GitHub` link from your project by following `these steps`_.    .. _these steps: https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/remove-edit-buttons.html.. admonition:: Make Your Own Homepage   :class: note    Note that you can also set up a base index file in your project for the ``Generator``    to append if you'd like to include a brief overview of the package.    We simply pass the filename of our README to the    ``DocumentPackages`` method.Let People Know---------------If your project generates documentation automatically, please add a badge to your project to let people know! We hope that these badges will stir curiosity, involvement, and community contributions to the ``gendocs`` package.Markdown:.. code-block:: text    [![Documentation Built by gendocs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs%20by-gendocs-blue.svg)](https://gendocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)RST / Sphinx:.. code-block:: text    .. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/docs%20by-gendocs-blue.svg       :target: https://gendocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/       :alt: Documentation Built by gendocsContribute----------Check out ``gendocs`` of `GitHub`_ to Contribute and make automatic documentation even better!.. _GitHub: https://github.com/banesullivan/gendocs</longdescription>
