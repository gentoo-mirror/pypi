	<longdescription>==========flufl.lock==========NFS-safe file locking with timeouts for POSIX and Windows.The ``flufl.lock`` library provides an NFS-safe file-based locking algorithminfluenced by the GNU/Linux ``open(2)`` manpage, under the description of the``O_EXCL`` option.    [...] O_EXCL is broken on NFS file systems, programs which rely on it    for performing locking tasks will contain a race condition.  The    solution for performing atomic file locking using a lockfile is to    create a unique file on the same fs (e.g., incorporating hostname and    pid), use link(2) to make a link to the lockfile.  If link() returns    0, the lock is successful.  Otherwise, use stat(2) on the unique file    to check if its link count has increased to 2, in which case the lock    is also successful.The assumption made here is that there will be no *outside interference*,e.g. no agent external to this code will ever ``link()`` to the specific lockfiles used.Lock objects support lock-breaking so that you can't wedge a process forever.This is especially helpful in a web environment, but may not be appropriatefor all applications.Locks have a *lifetime*, which is the maximum length of time the processexpects to retain the lock.  It is important to pick a good number herebecause other processes will not break an existing lock until the expectedlifetime has expired.  Too long and other processes will hang; too short andyou'll end up trampling on existing process locks -- and possibly corruptingdata.  In a distributed (NFS) environment, you also need to make sure thatyour clocks are properly synchronized.Author======``flufl.lock`` is Copyright (C) 2007-2023 Barry Warsaw &lt;barry@python.org&gt;Licensed under the terms of the Apache License Version 2.0.
