	<longdescription># Robocorp InspectorRobocorp Inspector is a tool for exploring various user interfacesand developing ways to target elements within them. An expressionthat can target specific UI elemements is called a _locator_, andthese locators can be used to automate applications typicallyused by humans.## DependenciesYou might need to create a `.npmrc` file at project level with contents similar to the following, but with your own `authToken`.This is needed for private repositories.```registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/@robocorp:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com///npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX```&gt; There is a hard dependency to the [Inspector Commons](https://github.com/robocorp/inspector-commons) implementation.&gt; Most of the implementation resides in `inspector-commons` and if you spot any misalignment then you should correct it## DevelopmentThe project uses `invoke` for overall project management, `poetry` forpython dependencies and environments, and `yarn` for Javascript dependenciesand building.Both `invoke` and `poetry` should be installed via pip: `pip install poetry invoke`- To see all possible tasks: `invoke --list`- To run the project: `invoke run `- For a quick build and run you can try running: `inv build-js &amp;&amp; inv build &amp;&amp; inv run`- To clean the dev environment you can use `inv clean` or `inv clean --force`All source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/robocorp/inspector/).### Python &amp; NPMTo launch the development environment you'll need:```pyenv + virtualenv -&gt; these will help building a dedicated python virtual environmentnvm -&gt; will help with a contained version of node + npm```In order for everything to install and build properly use the following versions:```python -&gt; v3.8.10node -&gt; v16.14.2npm -&gt; 8.5.0```## UsageRobocorp Inspector is distributed as a Python package with all front-endcomponents compiled and included statically.If the package (and all required dependencies) is installed manually,it can be run with the command: `inspector`.## Code Organization&gt; Attention: these might change over time &amp; hopefully they will be maintained.### Inspector Class Diagram- not extremely precise- created to show how things link together from local implementation to `inspector-commons`![Inspector Class Diagram](./assets/InspectorClassDiagram.jpg)---&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img height=&quot;100&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.robocorp.com/brand/Logo/Dark%20logo%20transparent%20with%20buffer%20space/Dark%20logo%20transparent%20with%20buffer%20space.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</longdescription>
