	<longdescription># profpy### What is profpy?The profpy library is a centralized repository for Rowan's various python scripts to use.### Why use it?Many of Rowan's python scripts/programs utilize similar or congruent functions and classes that end up getting rewritten or evencopy/pasted wherever needed. Rather than continue this trend of untracked code, profpy allows us to have overhead control over these common functionsand classes. If a program or script needs to use a class or function, it can just import it from profpy rather than rewrite it. This will allow usto standardize some of our code practices moving forward.### Installation```bashpip3 install profpy```### CLIFor details on the ```profpy``` command line interface, [read the docs](https://github.com/rowanuniversity/profpy/tree/master/profpy/cli).### SubmodulesThe profpy library is organized into submodules: ```db```, ```web```, and ```apis```. The ```db``` submodule makes accessingOracle databases with cx_Oracle and or Sql-Alchemy simpler. The ```apis``` submodule contains wrapper-classes for some commonly used web APIs. The ```web``` submodule contains code for making easy,database-backed Flask apps, configured with CAS and role-based security.All three of these submodules can be used to cut back on duplicated code, as well as make the development process much lesstime consuming.  For in-depth documentation, explore the submodules individually:- [db](https://github.com/rowanuniversity/profpy/tree/master/profpy/db)- [apis](https://github.com/rowanuniversity/profpy/tree/master/profpy/apis)- [web](https://github.com/rowanuniversity/profpy/tree/master/profpy/web)### Dependencies- Python 3.6.7 or above- Oracle Instant Client</longdescription>
