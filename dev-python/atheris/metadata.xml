	<longdescription># Atheris: A Coverage-Guided, Native Python FuzzerAtheris is a coverage-guided Python fuzzing engine. It supports fuzzing of Python code, but also native extensions written for CPython. Atheris is based off of libFuzzer. When fuzzing native code, Atheris can be used in combination with Address Sanitizer or Undefined Behavior Sanitizer to catch extra bugs.## Installation InstructionsAtheris supports Linux (32- and 64-bit) and Mac OS X, Python versions 3.6-3.10.You can install prebuilt versions of Atheris with pip:```bashpip3 install atheris```These wheels come with a built-in libFuzzer, which is fine for fuzzing Pythoncode. If you plan to fuzz native extensions, you may need to build from sourceto ensure the libFuzzer version in Atheris matches your Clang version.### Building from SourceAtheris relies on libFuzzer, which is distributed with Clang. If you have a sufficiently new version of `clang` on your path, installation from source is as simple as:```bash# Build latest release from sourcepip3 install --no-binary atheris atheris# Build development code from sourcegit clone https://github.com/google/atheris.gitcd atherispip3 install .```If you don't have `clang` installed or it's too old, you'll need to download and build the latest version of LLVM. Follow the instructions in Installing Against New LLVM below.#### MacApple Clang doesn't come with libFuzzer, so you'll need to install a new version of LLVM from head. Follow the instructions in Installing Against New LLVM below.#### Installing Against New LLVM```bash# Building LLVMgit clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.gitcd llvm-projectmkdir buildcd buildcmake -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS='clang;compiler-rt' -G &quot;Unix Makefiles&quot; ../llvmmake -j 10  # This step is very slow# Installing AtherisCLANG_BIN=&quot;$(pwd)/bin/clang&quot; pip3 install &lt;whatever&gt;```## Using Atheris### Example```python#!/usr/bin/python3import atheriswith atheris.instrument_imports():  import some_library  import sysdef TestOneInput(data):  some_library.parse(data)atheris.Setup(sys.argv, TestOneInput)atheris.Fuzz()```When fuzzing Python, Atheris will report a failure if the Python code under test throws an uncaught exception.### Python coverageAtheris collects Python coverage information by instrumenting bytecode.There are 3 options for adding this instrumentation to the bytecode: - You can instrument the libraries you import:   ```python   with atheris.instrument_imports():     import foo     from bar import baz   ```   This will cause instrumentation to be added to `foo` and `bar`, as well as   any libraries they import. - Or, you can instrument individual functions:   ```python   @atheris.instrument_func   def my_function(foo, bar):     print(&quot;instrumented&quot;)   ``` - Or finally, you can instrument everything:   ```python   atheris.instrument_all()   ```   Put this right before `atheris.Setup()`. This will find every Python function   currently loaded in the interpreter, and instrument it.   This might take a while.Atheris can additionally instrument regular expression checks, e.g. `re.search`.To enable this feature, you will need to add:`atheris.enabled_hooks.add(&quot;RegEx&quot;)`To your script before your code calls `re.compile`.Internally this will import the `re` module and instrument the necessary functions.This is currently an experimental feature.#### Why am I getting &quot;No interesting inputs were found&quot;?You might see this error:```ERROR: no interesting inputs were found. Is the code instrumented for coverage? Exiting.```You'll get this error if the first 2 calls to `TestOneInput` didn't produce anycoverage events. Even if you have instrumented some Python code,this can happen if the instrumentation isn't reached in those first 2 calls.(For example, because you have a nontrivial `TestOneInput`). You can resolvethis by adding an `atheris.instrument_func` decorator to `TestOneInput`,using `atheris.instrument_all()`, or moving your `TestOneInput` function into aninstrumented module.### Visualizing Python code coverageExamining which lines are executed is helpful for understanding theeffectiveness of your fuzzer. Atheris is compatible with[`coverage.py`](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/): you can run your fuzzer usingthe `coverage.py` module as you would for any other Python program. Here's anexample:```bashpython3 -m coverage run your_fuzzer.py -atheris_runs=10000  # Times to runpython3 -m coverage html(cd htmlcov &amp;&amp; python3 -m http.server 8000)```Coverage reports are only generated when your fuzzer exits gracefully. Thishappens if: - you specify `-atheris_runs=&lt;number&gt;`, and that many runs have elapsed. - your fuzzer exits by Python exception. - your fuzzer exits by `sys.exit()`.No coverage report will be generated if your fuzzer exits due to acrash in native code, or due to libFuzzer's `-runs` flag (use `-atheris_runs`).If your fuzzer exits via other methods, such as SIGINT (Ctrl+C), Atheris willattempt to generate a report but may be unable to (depending on your code).For consistent reports, we recommend always using`-atheris_runs=&lt;number&gt;`.If you'd like to examine coverage when running with your corpus, you can dothat with the following command:```python3 -m coverage run your_fuzzer.py corpus_dir/* -atheris_runs=$(( 1 + $(ls corpus_dir | wc -l) ))```This will cause Atheris to run on each file in `&lt;corpus-dir&gt;`, then exit.Note: atheris use empty data set as the first input even if there is no empty file in `&lt;corpus_dir&gt;`.Importantly, if you leave off the `-atheris_runs=$(ls corpus_dir | wc -l)`, nocoverage report will be generated.Using coverage.py will significantly slow down your fuzzer, so only use it forvisualizing coverage; don't use it all the time.### Fuzzing Native ExtensionsIn order for fuzzing native extensions to be effective, your native extensionsmust be instrumented. See [Native Extension Fuzzing](https://github.com/google/atheris/blob/master/native_extension_fuzzing.md)for instructions.### Structure-aware FuzzingAtheris is based on a coverage-guided mutation-based fuzzer (LibFuzzer). Thishas the advantage of not requiring any grammar definition for generating inputs,making its setup easier. The disadvantage is that it will be harder for thefuzzer to generate inputs for code that parses complex data types. Often theinputs will be rejected early, resulting in low coverage.Atheris supports custom mutators[(as offered by LibFuzzer)](https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/docs/structure-aware-fuzzing.md)to produce grammar-aware inputs.Example (Atheris-equivalent of the[example in the LibFuzzer docs](https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/docs/structure-aware-fuzzing.md#example-compression)):```python@atheris.instrument_funcdef TestOneInput(data):  try:    decompressed = zlib.decompress(data)  except zlib.error:    return  if len(decompressed) &lt; 2:    return  try:    if decompressed.decode() == 'FU':      raise RuntimeError('Boom')  except UnicodeDecodeError:    pass```To reach the `RuntimeError` crash, the fuzzer needs to be able to produce inputsthat are valid compressed data and satisfy the checks after decompression.It is very unlikely that Atheris will be able to produce such inputs: mutationson the input data will most probably result in invalid data that will fail atdecompression-time.To overcome this issue, you can define a custom mutator function (equivalent to`LLVMFuzzerCustomMutator`).This example produces valid compressed data. To enable Atheris to make use ofit, pass the custom mutator function to the invocation of `atheris.Setup`.```pythondef CustomMutator(data, max_size, seed):  try:    decompressed = zlib.decompress(data)  except zlib.error:    decompressed = b'Hi'  else:    decompressed = atheris.Mutate(decompressed, len(decompressed))  return zlib.compress(decompressed)atheris.Setup(sys.argv, TestOneInput, custom_mutator=CustomMutator)atheris.Fuzz()```As seen in the example, the custom mutator may request Atheris to mutate datausing `atheris.Mutate()` (this is equivalent to `LLVMFuzzerMutate`).You can experiment with [custom_mutator_example.py](example_fuzzers/custom_mutator_example.py)and see that without the mutator Atheris would not be able to find the crash,while with the mutator this is achieved in a matter of seconds.```shell$ python3 example_fuzzers/custom_mutator_example.py --no_mutator[...]#2      INITED cov: 2 ft: 2 corp: 1/1b exec/s: 0 rss: 37Mb#524288 pulse  cov: 2 ft: 2 corp: 1/1b lim: 4096 exec/s: 262144 rss: 37Mb#1048576        pulse  cov: 2 ft: 2 corp: 1/1b lim: 4096 exec/s: 349525 rss: 37Mb#2097152        pulse  cov: 2 ft: 2 corp: 1/1b lim: 4096 exec/s: 299593 rss: 37Mb#4194304        pulse  cov: 2 ft: 2 corp: 1/1b lim: 4096 exec/s: 279620 rss: 37Mb[...]$ python3 example_fuzzers/custom_mutator_example.py[...]INFO: found LLVMFuzzerCustomMutator (0x7f9c989fb0d0).

You can pass the custom crossover function to the invocation of`atheris.Setup`. See its usage in [custom_crossover_fuzz_test.py](src/custom_crossover_fuzz_test.py).#### Structure-aware Fuzzing with Protocol Buffers[libprotobuf-mutator](https://github.com/google/libprotobuf-mutator) hasbindings to use it together with Atheris to perform structure-aware fuzzingusing protocol buffers.See the documentation for[atheris_libprotobuf_mutator](contrib/libprotobuf_mutator/README.md).## Integration with OSS-FuzzAtheris is fully supported by [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz), Google's continuous fuzzing service for open source projects. For integrating with OSS-Fuzz, please see [https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/getting-started/new-project-guide/python-lang](https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/getting-started/new-project-guide/python-lang).## APIThe `atheris` module provides three key functions: `instrument_imports()`, `Setup()` and `Fuzz()`.In your source file, import all libraries you wish to fuzz inside a `with atheris.instrument_imports():`-block, like this:```python# library_a will not get instrumentedimport library_awith atheris.instrument_imports():    # library_b will get instrumented    import library_b```Generally, it's best to import `atheris` first and then import all other libraries inside of a `with atheris.instrument_imports()` block.Next, define a fuzzer entry point function and pass it to `atheris.Setup()` along with the fuzzer's arguments (typically `sys.argv`). Finally, call `atheris.Fuzz()` to start fuzzing. You must call `atheris.Setup()` before `atheris.Fuzz()`.#### `instrument_imports(include=[], exclude=[])`- `include`: A list of fully-qualified module names that shall be instrumented.- `exclude`: A list of fully-qualified module names that shall NOT be instrumented.This should be used together with a `with`-statement. All modules imported insaid statement will be instrumented. However, because Python imports all modulesonly once, this cannot be used to instrument any previously imported module,including modules required by Atheris. To add coverage to those modules, use`instrument_all()` instead.A full list of unsupported modules can be retrieved as follows:```pythonimport sysimport atherisprint(sys.modules.keys())```#### `instrument_func(func)` - `func`: The function to instrument.This will instrument the specified Python function and then return `func`. Thisis typically used as a decorator, but can be used to instrument individualfunctions too. Note that the `func` is instrumented in-place, so this willaffect all call points of the function.This cannot be called on a bound method - call it on the unbound version.#### `instrument_all()`This will scan over all objects in the interpreter and call `instrument_func` onevery Python function. This works even on core Python interpreter functions,something which `instrument_imports` cannot do.This function is experimental.#### `Setup(args, test_one_input, internal_libfuzzer=None)` - `args`: A list of strings: the process arguments to pass to the fuzzer, typically `sys.argv`. This argument list may be modified in-place, to remove arguments consumed by the fuzzer.   See [the LibFuzzer docs](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#options) for a list of such options. - `test_one_input`: your fuzzer's entry point. Must take a single `bytes` argument. This will be repeatedly invoked with a single bytes container. - `internal_libfuzzer`: Indicates whether libfuzzer will be provided by atheris or by an external library (see [native_extension_fuzzing.md](./native_extension_fuzzing.md)). If unspecified, Atheris will determine this   automatically. If fuzzing pure Python, leave this as `True`.#### `Fuzz()`This starts the fuzzer. You must have called `Setup()` before calling this function. This function does not return.In many cases `Setup()` and `Fuzz()` could be combined into a single function, but they areseparated because you may want the fuzzer to consume the command-line arguments it handlesbefore passing any remaining arguments to another setup function.#### `FuzzedDataProvider`Often, a `bytes` object is not convenient input to your code being fuzzed. Similar to libFuzzer, we provide a FuzzedDataProvider to translate these bytes into other input forms.You can construct the FuzzedDataProvider with:```pythonfdp = atheris.FuzzedDataProvider(input_bytes)```The FuzzedDataProvider then supports the following functions:```pythondef ConsumeBytes(count: int)```Consume `count` bytes.```pythondef ConsumeUnicode(count: int)```Consume unicode characters. Might contain surrogate pair characters, which according to the specification are invalid in this situation. However, many core software tools (e.g. Windows file paths) support them, so other software often needs to too.```pythondef ConsumeUnicodeNoSurrogates(count: int)```Consume unicode characters, but never generate surrogate pair characters.```pythondef ConsumeString(count: int)```Alias for `ConsumeBytes` in Python 2, or `ConsumeUnicode` in Python 3.```pythondef ConsumeInt(int: bytes)```Consume a signed integer of the specified size (when written in two's complement notation).```pythondef ConsumeUInt(int: bytes)```Consume an unsigned integer of the specified size.```pythondef ConsumeIntInRange(min: int, max: int)```Consume an integer in the range [`min`, `max`].```pythondef ConsumeIntList(count: int, bytes: int)```Consume a list of `count` integers of `size` bytes.```pythondef ConsumeIntListInRange(count: int, min: int, max: int)```Consume a list of `count` integers in the range [`min`, `max`].```pythondef ConsumeFloat()```Consume an arbitrary floating-point value. Might produce weird values like `NaN` and `Inf`.```pythondef ConsumeRegularFloat()```Consume an arbitrary numeric floating-point value; never produces a special type like `NaN` or `Inf`.```pythondef ConsumeProbability()```Consume a floating-point value in the range [0, 1].```pythondef ConsumeFloatInRange(min: float, max: float)```Consume a floating-point value in the range [`min`, `max`].```pythondef ConsumeFloatList(count: int)```Consume a list of `count` arbitrary floating-point values. Might produce weird values like `NaN` and `Inf`.```pythondef ConsumeRegularFloatList(count: int)```Consume a list of `count` arbitrary numeric floating-point values; never produces special types like `NaN` or `Inf`.```pythondef ConsumeProbabilityList(count: int)```Consume a list of `count` floats in the range [0, 1].```pythondef ConsumeFloatListInRange(count: int, min: float, max: float)```Consume a list of `count` floats in the range [`min`, `max`]```pythondef PickValueInList(l: list)```Given a list, pick a random value```pythondef ConsumeBool()```Consume either `True` or `False`.</longdescription>
