This package is installed along with &gt; FAST-OAD, to keep backward compatibility.&gt; &gt; Keep in mind that any update of these models will now come through new releases of FAST-OAD-CS25.&gt; &gt; To get FAST-OAD without these models, you may install&gt; [FAST-OAD-core](https://pypi.org/project/fast-oad-core/).&gt; &gt; :warning: Upgrading from an earlier version than 1.3 may break the `fastoad` command line (no &gt; impact on PythonAPI). See [this issue](https://github.com/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD/issues/425)&gt; for details and fix.Want to try quickly?--------------------You can run FAST-OAD tutorials **without installation** using our[Binder-hosted Jupyter notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fast-aircraft-design/FAST-OAD.git/latest-release?filepath=src%2Ffastoad%2Fnotebooks).Install-------**Prerequisite**:FAST-OAD needs at least **Python 3.7.0**.It is recommended (but not required) to install FAST-OAD in a virtualenvironment ([conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/),[venv](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/venv.html), ...)Once Python is installed, FAST-OAD can be installed using pip.&gt; **Note**: If your network uses a proxy, you may have to do [some&gt; settings](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#using-a-proxy-server)&gt; for pip to work correctlyYou can install the latest version with this command:``` {.bash}$ pip install --upgrade fast-oad```or, if you want the minimum installation without the CS25-related models:``` {.bash}$ pip install --upgrade fast-oad-core```</longdescription>
