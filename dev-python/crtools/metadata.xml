As of current version, there's only one possibleparameter: api_key. The file should look like:.. code:: ini  [API]  # API key provided for your account at https://developer.clashroyale.com  # Note that the key is limited to a specific list of public IP addresses  api_key=&lt;YOUR-API-KEY&gt;  # Your clan tag  clan_id=#JY8YVV  # Proxy URL -- URL for proxy server, if needed  #proxy=https://my-proxy.com  # Proxy headers -- custom headers for proxy if needed  #proxy_headers=headers  [Paths]  # your output path. Where you want the static website to live.  out=/var/www/html  # Path to the logo artwork for clan. Must be PNG. Recommended at  # least 64x64 pixels.  clan_logo=~/myclan/logo.png  # Path to the favicon file you want to use for this  favicon=~/myclan/favicon.ico  # Path to a file that contains arbitrary HTML for the site.  description_html=~/myclan/body.html  [www]  # Canonical URL for this site. Used for setting the rel=canonical  # link in the web site, as well as generating the robots.txt  # and sitemap.xml  canonical_url=https://yourclan.com/For more details, see `samples/crtools.ini &lt;https://github.com/AaronTraas/Clash-Royale-Clan-Tools/blob/master/samples/crtools.ini&gt;`_===================================================================Optional blacklist and vacation management using Google Sheets===================================================================You can optionally use a Google Sheets log to keep track of demeritsand vacations. If you want that info to be integrated with crtools, youneed to copy the`crtools member log template &lt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_8YKfJf-2HVZOgtuosVaGM_50kB8q7YYR3H2d8p0Wzw&gt;`_to your Google Docs account and use that. Fill in with info about yourclan. Be sure not to re-name any of the tabs, or add/remove any columns.You will also need to sign up for a `Google Cloud API key &lt;https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/authorizing#APIKey&gt;`_.Then you will have to go to the `Google Developer API library page &lt;https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/sheets.googleapis.com&gt;`_, and enable the Google Sheets library for your account.You will then need to go the the `Google credential management page &lt;https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials&gt;`_, edit the API key you created, giving it access to the Sheets API.Once you have created a key that you can use for this purpose, find the sheet ID from your spreadsheet URL, addthe following to your config file:.. code:: ini  [google_docs]  api_key=&lt;YOUR-API-KEY&gt;  sheet_id=&lt;YOUR-SHEET-ID&gt;==================================================Using the ClashRoyale Official Fan Kit==================================================The design of this site is optionally enhanced by the fan kit provided bySupercell here. To enable automated downloading of the fan kit, add:.. code::  use_fankit=TrueTo the :code:`[Paths]` section of your config file.NOTE: This requires about 5GB free in your temp forlder on the machine thatcrtools runs on. It will take 10-15 minutes to download and extract, but onlythe first time you run with the fankit enabled.If you have problems, you can manually install the fan kit. See`Fan Kit Manual Install Instructions &lt;https://github.com/AaronTraas/Clash-Royale-Clan-Tools/blob/master/fankit-manual-install.md&gt;`_==================================================Other languages/locales==================================================Crtools currently supports the following languages:======= =================locale  language======= =================cn      Chinesede      Germanen      English (default)fr      Frenchit      Italianpt      Portugeseru      Russian======= =================If you'd like to use a language other than English, add the following switchon the command line:.. code::  --locale=frThe above example is French. Use the locale code listed aboveIf you wish for crtools to be available in another languages, reach out tome. I'm unable to do the translation myself (I speak only English), but I canhelp you provide a translation for this.==================================================Suggested usage on a Linux web server==================================================This tool is a static site generator -- it generates static HTML, JavaScript,and CSS used to render the dashboard. If you wish to use this, you should setit up to run once per hour on your web server using :code:`cron` or similar.Below is an example setup on Linux.Assuming root is going to be running the script:1. Install this application via pip2. Install nginx or apache3. Find your document root (e.g., :code:`/var/www/html`)4. Create :code:`/root/.crtools` file as specified above, and add your   API key (from https://developer.clashroyale.com), output path (the   document root), and clan tag5. Create the following entry in your crontab:.. code::  0 * * * * crtools==================================================Development links==================================================This project uses SonarQube for static analysis.
