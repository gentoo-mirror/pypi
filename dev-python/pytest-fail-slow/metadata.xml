It adds a ``--fail-slow DURATION`` command-line option to pytestthat causes any &amp; all otherwise-passing tests that run for longer than thegiven duration to be marked as failures, and it adds a``@pytest.mark.fail_slow(DURATION)`` marker for making an individual test failif it runs for longer than the given duration.  If ``--fail-slow`` is given anda test has the ``@fail_slow()`` marker, the duration given by the marker takesprecedence for that test.Note that slow tests will still be run to completion; if you want them toinstead be stopped early, use pytest-timeout_... _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org.. _pytest-timeout: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-timeoutA duration can be supplied to the ``--fail-slow`` option as either a barefloating-point number of seconds or as a floating-point number followed by oneof the following units (case insensitive):- ``h``, ``hour``, ``hours``- ``m``, ``min``, ``mins``, ``minute``, ``minutes``- ``s``, ``sec``, ``secs``, ``second``, ``seconds``- ``ms``, ``milli``, ``millisec``, ``milliseconds``- ``us``, ``μs``, ``micro``, ``microsec``, ``microseconds``Durations passed to the ``@pytest.mark.fail_slow()`` marker can be eitherints/floats (for a number of seconds) or strings in the same format as passedto ``--fail-slow``.If ``pytest-fail-slow`` marks a test as a failure, the output will include thetest's duration and the duration threshold, like so::    ________________________________ test_func ________________________________    Test passed but took too long to run: Duration 123.0s &gt; 5.0s**Note:** Only the durations for tests themselves are taken into consideration.If a test passes in less than the specified duration, but one or more fixturesetups/teardowns take longer than the duration, the test will still be markedas passing.Installation============``pytest-fail-slow`` requires Python 3.6 or higher and pytest 6.0 or higher.Just use `pip &lt;https://pip.pypa.io&gt;`_ for Python 3 (You have pip, right?) toinstall it::    python3 -m pip install pytest-fail-slow</longdescription>
