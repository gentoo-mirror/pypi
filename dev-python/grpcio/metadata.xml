	<longdescription>gRPC Python===========|compat_check_pypi|Package for gRPC Python... |compat_check_pypi| image:: https://python-compatibility-tools.appspot.com/one_badge_image?package=grpcio   :target: https://python-compatibility-tools.appspot.com/one_badge_target?package=grpcioSupported Python Versions-------------------------Python &gt;= 3.7Installation------------gRPC Python is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.Installing From PyPI~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~If you are installing locally...::  $ pip install grpcioElse system wide (on Ubuntu)...::  $ sudo pip install grpcioIf you're on Windows make sure that you installed the :code:`pip.exe` componentwhen you installed Python (if not go back and install it!) then invoke:::  $ pip.exe install grpcioWindows users may need to invoke :code:`pip.exe` from a command line ran asadministrator.n.b. On Windows and on Mac OS X one *must* have a recent release of :code:`pip`to retrieve the proper wheel from PyPI. Be sure to upgrade to the latestversion!Installing From Source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Building from source requires that you have the Python headers (usually apackage named :code:`python-dev`).::  $ export REPO_ROOT=grpc  # REPO_ROOT can be any directory of your choice  $ git clone -b RELEASE_TAG_HERE https://github.com/grpc/grpc $REPO_ROOT  $ cd $REPO_ROOT  $ git submodule update --init  # For the next two commands do `sudo pip install` if you get permission-denied errors  $ pip install -rrequirements.txt  $ GRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_WITH_CYTHON=1 pip install .You cannot currently install Python from source on Windows. Things might workout for you in MSYS2 (follow the Linux instructions), but it isn't officiallysupported at the moment.Troubleshooting~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Help, I ...* **... see a** :code:`pkg_resources.VersionConflict` **when I try to install  grpc**  This is likely because :code:`pip` doesn't own the offending dependency,  which in turn is likely because your operating system's package manager owns  it. You'll need to force the installation of the dependency:  :code:`pip install --ignore-installed $OFFENDING_DEPENDENCY`  For example, if you get an error like the following:  ::    Traceback (most recent call last):    File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 17, in &lt;module&gt;     ...    File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py&quot;, line 509, in find      raise VersionConflict(dist, req)    pkg_resources.VersionConflict: (six 1.8.0 (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages), Requirement.parse('six&gt;=1.10'))  You can fix it by doing:  ::    sudo pip install --ignore-installed six* **... see the following error on some platforms**  ::    /tmp/pip-build-U8pSsr/cython/Cython/Plex/Scanners.c:4:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory    #include &quot;Python.h&quot;                    ^    compilation terminated.  You can fix it by installing `python-dev` package. i.e  ::    sudo apt-get install python-dev</longdescription>
