	<longdescription>======= Sopel=======|version| |build| |issues| |alerts| |coverage-status| |license|Introduction------------Sopel is a simple, lightweight, open source, easy-to-use IRC Utility bot,written in Python. It's designed to be easy to use, run and extend.Installation------------Latest stable release=====================On most systems where you can run Python, the best way to install Sopel is toinstall `pip &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pip/&gt;`_ and then ``pip install sopel``.Arch users can install the ``sopel`` package from the [community] repository,though new versions might take slightly longer to become available.Failing both of those options, you can grab the latest tarball `from GitHub&lt;https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel/releases/latest&gt;`_  and follow the stepsfor installing from the latest source below.Latest source=============First, either clone the repository with ``git clonegit://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel.git`` or download a tarball `from GitHub&lt;https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel/releases/latest&gt;`_.Note: Sopel requires Python 2.7.x or Python 3.3+ to run. On Python 2.7,Sopel requires ``backports.ssl_match_hostname`` to be installed. Use``pip install backports.ssl_match_hostname`` or``yum install python-backports.ssl_match_hostname`` to install it, or downloadand install it manually `from PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/backports.ssl_match_hostname&gt;`_.Important: Sopel 8.0 will drop support for many old Python versions,including Python 2.7!In the source directory (whether cloned or from the tarball) run ``pip install-e .``. You can then run ``sopel`` to configure and start the bot.Database support----------------Sopel leverages SQLAlchemy to support the following database types: SQLite,MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle, Firebird, and Sybase. By default Sopel willuse a SQLite database in the current configuration directory, but alternativedatabases can be configured with the following config options: ``db_type``,``db_filename`` (SQLite only), ``db_driver``, ``db_user``, ``db_pass``,``db_host``, ``db_port``, and ``db_name``. You will need to manually installany packages (system or ``pip``) needed to make your chosen database work.**Note:** Plugins not updated since Sopel 7.0 was released *might* haveproblems with database types other than SQLite (but many will work just fine).Adding plugins--------------The easiest place to put new plugins is in ``~/.sopel/plugins``. Some newerplugins are installable as packages; `search PyPI&lt;https://pypi.org/search/?q=%22sopel%22&gt;`_ for these. Many more pluginswritten by other users can be found using your favorite search engine.Some older, unmaintained plugins are available in the`sopel-extras &lt;https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel-extras&gt;`_ repository, but ofcourse you can also write your own. A `tutorial &lt;https://sopel.chat/tutorials/part-1-writing-plugins/&gt;`_for creating new plugins is available on Sopel's website.API documentation can be found online at https://sopel.chat/docs/, oryou can create a local version by running ``make docs``.Further documentation---------------------The `official website &lt;https://sopel.chat/&gt;`_ includes such valuable informationas a full listing of built-in `commands &lt;https://sopel.chat/usage/commands/&gt;`_,`tutorials &lt;https://sopel.chat/tutorials/&gt;`_, `API documentation &lt;https://sopel.chat/docs/&gt;`_,and other `usage information &lt;https://sopel.chat/usage/&gt;`_.Questions?----------Join us in `#sopel &lt;irc://irc.libera.chat/#sopel&gt;`_ on Libera Chat.Donations---------We're thrilled that you want to support the project!You can `sponsor Sopel &lt;https://github.com/sponsors/sopel-irc&gt;`_ here onGitHub or donate through `Open Collective &lt;https://opencollective.com/sopel&gt;`_.Any donations received will be used to cover infrastructure costs, such as ourdomain name and hosting services. Our main project site is easily hosted by`Netlify &lt;https://www.netlify.com/&gt;`_, but we are considering building a fewnew features that would require more than static hosting. All project-related`expenses &lt;https://opencollective.com/sopel/expenses&gt;`_ are tracked on ourOpen Collective profile, for transparency... |version| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sopel.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sopel.. |build| image:: https://travis-ci.org/sopel-irc/sopel.svg?branch=master   :target: https://travis-ci.org/sopel-irc/sopel.. |issues| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/issues/sopel-irc/sopel.svg   :target: https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel/issues.. |alerts| image:: https://img.shields.io/lgtm/alerts/g/sopel-irc/sopel.svg   :target: https://lgtm.com/projects/g/sopel-irc/sopel/alerts/.. |coverage-status| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/sopel-irc/sopel/badge.svg?branch=master   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/sopel-irc/sopel?branch=master.. |license| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/sopel.svg   :target: https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel/blob/master/COPYING</longdescription>
