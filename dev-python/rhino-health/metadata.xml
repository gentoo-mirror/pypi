	<longdescription># Rhino Health SDKProgrammatic interface for interacting with the **Rhino Health** Federated Learning Platform.## Example UsagePlease see the sample notebook files provided to you by the Rhino Health Team for additional use cases.### Create a session```pythonimport rhino_healthmy_username = &quot;rhino_user@rhinohealth.com&quot; # Replace memy_password = &quot;ASecurePasswordYouSet321&quot; # Replace mesession = rhino_health.login(username=my_username, password=my_password)```There will be three ways to interact with the API after you have a session1. Use defined endpoints under lib/endpoints for single actions2. Use our library functions for commonly performed advanced features3. Use our low level API Interface (advanced users)### Interact with the API via defined endpointsWe've included convenience functions for our most commonly used endpoints in the library with required input and outputdata classes. These can be found in `rhino_health/lib/endpoints`.```pythonmy_projects = session.project.get_projects()my_first_project = my_projects[0]my_first_project.add_collaborator(collaborating_workgroup_uid)my_cohort = session.cohort.get_cohort(my_cohort_uid)cohort_project = my_cohort.projectmy_cohort_info = my_cohort.cohort_info```### Library FunctionsRhinoHealth also provides library functions which combine our basic building blocks to perform common actions.Example:```pythonfrom rhino_health.lib.metrics import RocAucWithCImetric_configuration = RocAucWithCI(y_true_variable=&quot;label&quot;, y_pred_variable=&quot;pred&quot;, confidence_interval=95, timeout_seconds=600)&quot;&quot;&quot;data_filters=[{        &quot;filter_column&quot;:&quot;is_roc&quot;,        &quot;filter_value&quot;:1    }]&quot;&quot;&quot;result = my_cohort.get_metric(metric_configuration)print(f&quot;{result.output}&quot;)```### Interact using the low level APIPlease contact us for support with interacting with our low level API.### Rate LimitsThe Rhino SDK handles rate limits of the API for you if you use the same session between threads and will attempt to queue requests.Excess requests will be sent with exponential backoff. If you send requests to our server from multiple locationsthen you may run into exceptions.## Development NotesPlease install libyaml required by our testing library (see https://vcrpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)```shbrew install libyamlpip uninstall pyyamlpip --no-cache-dir install pyyaml```You may need to use `pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir` on M1 Macs</longdescription>
