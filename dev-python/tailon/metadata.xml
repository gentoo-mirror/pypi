	<longdescription>Notice======This project is in maintenance mode. Please consider using the new tailon_,which is currently under slow, but steady development. The new version comeswith the following improvements:* Fully self-contained executables. Just download (or build) and run.* Tiny footprint - the tailon executable sits at 2.5MB in size and uses roughly 10MB of RSS.* More responsive user-interface.While some features are missing, it is already usable to a large degree.----Tailon======Tailon is a self-hosted web application for looking at and searchingthrough log files. It is little more than a fancy web wrapper aroundthe following commands::    tail -f    tail -f | grep    tail -f | awk    tail -f | sedDocumentation:    http://tailon-legacy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Development:    https://github.com/gvalkov/tailon-legacyPackage:    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tailonChangelog:    http://tailon-legacy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changelog.html.. _tailon: https://github.com/gvalkov/tailon</longdescription>
