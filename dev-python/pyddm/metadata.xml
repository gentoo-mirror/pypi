	<longdescription># PyDDM - Generalized drift-diffusion models for Python# OverviewPyDDM is a simulator and modeling framework for generalized drift-diffusionmodels (DDM), with a focus on cognitive neuroscience.Key features include:- Models solved numerically using Crank-Nicolson to solve the  Fokker-Planck equation (Backward Euler, analytical solutions, and  particle simulations also available)- Arbitrary functions for drift rate, noise, bounds, and initial  position distribution- Arbitrary loss function and fitting method for parameter fitting- Optional multiprocessor support- Optional GUI for debugging and gaining an intuition for different  models- Convenient and extensible object oriented API allows building models  in a component-wise fashion- Verified accuracy of simulations using novel program verification  techniquesSee the [documentation](https://pyddm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),[FAQs](https://pyddm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faqs.html), or[tutorial](https://pyddm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) for moreinformation.  If you want to try it out before installing, visit the[interactive onlinedemo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mwshinn/PyDDM/blob/master/doc/notebooks/interactive_demo.ipynb).See the [Github Forums](https://github.com/mwshinn/PyDDM/discussions) for helpfrom the PyDDM community.  You can also sign up for [release announcements byemail](https://www.freelists.org/list/pyddm-announce).## InstallationNormally, you can install with:    $ pip install pyddmIf you are in a shared environment (e.g. a cluster), install with:    $ pip install pyddm --userIf installing from source, [download the source code](https://github.com/mwshinn/PyDDM), extract, and do:    $ python3 setup.py install## System requirements- Python 3.5 or above- Numpy version 1.9.2 or higher- Scipy version 0.16.0 or higher- Matplotlib- [Paranoid Scientist](&lt;https://github.com/mwshinn/paranoidscientist&gt;)- Pathos (optional, for multiprocessing support)- A C compiler (If you don't already have one, the easiest way to install one  may be by installing Cython.)## ContactFor help on using PyDDM, see the [GithubForums](https://github.com/mwshinn/PyDDM/discussions).Please report bugs to &lt;https://github.com/mwshinn/pyddm/issues&gt;.  Thisincludes any problems with the documentation.  Pull Requests for bugs aregreatly appreciated.Feature requests are currently not being accepted due to limitedresources.  If you implement a new feature in PyDDM, please do thefollowing before submitting a Pull Request on Github:- Make sure your code is clean and well commented- If appropriate, update the official documentation in the docs/  directory- Ensure there are Paranoid Scientist verification conditions to your  code- Write unit tests and optionally integration tests for your new  feature (runtests.sh)- Ensure all existing tests passFor all other questions or comments, contact m.shinn@ucl.ac.uk.## LicenseAll code is available under the MIT license.
