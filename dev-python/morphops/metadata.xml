A = [[0,0],[2,0],[2,2],[1,3],[0,2]]   B = [[0.1,-0.1],[2,0],[2.3,1.8],[1,3],[0.4,2]]   C = [[-0.1,-0.1],[2.1,0],[2,1.8],[0.9,3.1],[-0.4,2.1]]   # Perform Generalized Procrustes alignment to align A, B, C.   res = mops.gpa([A, B, C])   # res['aligned'] contains the aligned A, B, C. res['mean'] is their mean.   # Create a Thin-plate Spline warp from A to B and warp C.   warped_C = mops.tps_warp(A, B, C)   # warped_C contains the image of the pts in C under the TPS warp.What is Geometric Morphometrics?================================Geometric Morphometrics is a statistical toolkit for quantifying and studyingshapes of forms that are represented by homologous landmark sets.&quot;Shape&quot; has a specific notion here. For a given landmark set, its shape refersto the spatial information that survives after discarding its absoluteposition, scale and rotation. So two landmark sets have the same shape if theycan be brought in perfect alignment by only changing their positions, scalesand rotations.Common Operations and Algorithms in Studies-------------------------------------------Geometric Morphometrics is often used when pursuing statistical questionsinvolving the morphology of biological forms, like `do corvid species that frequently probe have longer bills and more to-the-side orbits than corvid species that frequently peck&lt;https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-9994-6-2&gt;`_.It helps inform the Data Collection, Preprocessing and Analysissteps of such statistical studies with sound theoretical or practical justifications.Data Collection^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The most prevalent form of Data Collection involves picking homologouslandmarks on each form. For curving forms with few homologous points butwell-understood homologous regions, there is a notion of semilandmarks whichcan &quot;slide&quot; to minimize equidistant sampling artifacts.A common file format for saving landmarks for a set of specimens is the `*.dta`format used by the IDAV Landmark Editor software.Preprocessing^^^^^^^^^^^^^As discussed before, a central idea in Geometric Morphometrics is extractingthe &quot;shapes&quot; of the landmark sets. One way to achieve this is to use theGeneralized Procrustes Alignment algorithm or GPA. GPA aligns all the landmarksets by modifying their locations, orientations and sizes so as to minimizetheir collective interlandmark distances.After this step, the aligned shapes all lie in a high-dimensional non-linear manifold. For example, if the orignal landmark sets were a set of triangles,the aligned shapes lie on a sphere. Moreover, for naturally arising datasets,the shapes likely lie very close to each other and are distributed around amean shape. This usually makes it permissible to project all the shapes intothe tangent space at the mean shape, and this way the final shape vectors liein a linear space.Analysis^^^^^^^^With the shapes lying in a high-dimensional linear space after preprocessing,they can now be submitted to various commonly used statistical procedures likePrincipal Components Analysis and various kinds of regression for furtheranalysis.**(This file was autogenerated from README_for_docs.rst by running `make README_for_gh` in the docs directory)**</longdescription>
