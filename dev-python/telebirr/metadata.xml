	<longdescription># TelebirrThis is a python helper package for Telebirr H5 Web payment integration helper. The use case for this interface ispayment via web. Third party system will invoke the interface upon payment issue by the customer and a redirect pagewill be return to the third party system from telebirr platform.## Logical specification![alt text](img/logical design.png &quot;Logical spacification&quot;)## Platform Authentication Rule1. Telebirr platform allocate appId and appKey to the corresponding third party client. Each third party will have a   unique appId and appKey.2. Third party source IP addresses should be added on the trust list. Those IP addresses of clients that are not in the   trust list will not access telebirr system.3. The time of the timestamp is consistent with that of the server (within one minute). If they are inconsistent, the   access is considered illegal.4. Check whether the signature entered by the client is consistent with the signature generated by the system. If they   are inconsistent, the access is considered illegal.## Interface Description|Parameter |Data Type | Mandatory or Optional |Description| Example||----------|----------|-----------------------|-----------|--------||appId |String |M |Indicates the appID provided from telebirr platform.
