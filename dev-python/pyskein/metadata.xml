	<longdescription>PySkein is an extension module for Python, implementing the        Skein hash algorithm, one of the five finalists of the        NIST SHA-3 Competition. While ultimately not selected        as the winner of that competition, Skein may still be        useful as an alternative hash algorithm, offering flexible        hashing modes with various parameters. PySkein provides all        features of Skein through a Pythonic interface and is released        as free software under the GNU General Public License.        Its highlights are:                * Simple interface following the hash algorithms in the          Python standard library (like hashlib.sha1 or          hashlib.sha256)                * All features of the Skein specification          (flexible digest sizes, MAC generation, tree hashing, and          various others)                * High performance through optimized C implementation          (7.1 cycles/byte for sequential hashing and 4.2 cycles/byte          for tree hashing on two cores, measured on an Athlon 64 X2)                * Threefish, the tweakable block cipher used in Skein,          available for encryption and decryption on its own</longdescription>
