	<longdescription>===========================SQLAlchemy 2 Stubs (Legacy)===========================These are interim PEP-484 typing stubs for the`SQLAlchemy &lt;https://www.sqlalchemy.org&gt;`_ **1.4 release series only**. Theyare released concurrently along with a`Mypy extension &lt;https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/mypy.html&gt;`_which is designed to work with these stubs, which assists primarily in the areaof ORM mappings.The stubs replace the use of the &quot;sqlalchemy-stubs&quot; package published byDropbox. Differences include that these stubs are generated against 1.4's APIas well as some adjustments to the use of generics. The sqlalchemy2-stubs stubspackage **will not work with SQLAlchemy 2.0, and will need to be explicitly /manually uninstalled when upgrading to SQLAlchemy 2.0**.This project should be considered **alpha level** and is not as matureas the Dropbox stubs for the initial release.See the Mypy plugin documentation at https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/mypy.htmlfor an overview of how to use PEP-484 annotations with ORM mapped classes.For SQLAlchemy 2.0, when released, **the sqlalchemy2-stubs project is notcompatible**.  SQLAlchemy 2.0 will be / is fully pep-484 typed inline andwill not be compatible with any stubs.  There unfortunately appears to be nostandard approach in Python for the problem of a library that upgrades toinclude typing annotations inline, as typing tools will still considerany installed stubs to take precedence.  Therefore **sqlalchemy2-stubswill need to be manually uninstalled when upgrading to SQLAlchemy 2.0**.Code of Conduct---------------Above all, SQLAlchemy places great emphasis on polite, thoughtful, andconstructive communication between users and developers.Please see our current Code of Conduct at`Code of Conduct &lt;http://www.sqlalchemy.org/codeofconduct.html&gt;`_.License-------SQLAlchemy is distributed under the `MIT license&lt;http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php&gt;`_.</longdescription>
