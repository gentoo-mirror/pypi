Change things from this point on===============================================BGP-MPLS VPN Extension for OpenStack Networking===============================================This project provides an API and Framework to interconnect BGP/MPLS VPNsto Openstack Neutron networks, routers and ports.The Border Gateway Protocol and Multi-Protocol Label Switching are widelyused Wide Area Networking technologies. The primary purpose of this projectis to allow attachment of Neutron networks and/or routers to VPNs built incarrier provided WANs using these standard protocols. An additional purposeof this project is to enable the use of these technologies within the Neutronnetworking environment.A vendor-neutral API and data model are provided such that multiple SDNcontrollers may be used as backends, while offering the same tenant facing API.A reference implementation working along with Neutron reference drivers isalso provided.* Free software: Apache license* Source: https://opendev.org/openstack/networking-bgpvpn* Bugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bgpvpn* Doc: https://docs.openstack.org/networking-bgpvpn/latest/* Release notes: https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/networking-bgpvpn/===================Introduction videos===================The following videos are filmed presentations of talks given during theBarcelona OpenStack Summit (Oct' 2016).
