It is developed and maintained by the`Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group`_ and our network of volunteers.It is distributed under the `3-Clause BSD License`_.The basic workflow is to start with the geometry of an initial plan andgenerate a large collection of sample plans for comparison. Usually, wewill constrain these sampled plans in such a way that they perform atleast as well as the initial plan according to traditional districtingprinciples, such as population balance or compactness. Comparing theinitial plan to the ensemble provides quantitative tools for measuringwhether or not it is an outlier among the sampled plans... _`Voting Rights Data Institute`: http://gerrydata.org/.. _chain: https://github.com/gerrymandr/cfp_mcmc.. _`Markov chain Monte Carlo`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo.. _`Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group`: https://www.mggg.org/.. _`3-Clause BSD License`: https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-ClauseGetting started===============See our `Getting started guide`_ for the basics of using GerryChain... _`Getting started guide`: https://gerrychain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart.htmlWe also highly recommend the resources prepared by Daryl R.

Ifthe environment you want to activate is called ``vrdi`` (for example),then you can do this by running.. code-block:: console    conda activate vrdiIf this command causes problems, make sure conda is up-to-date byrunning.. code-block:: console    conda update conda    conda initFor more information on using conda to install packages and managedependencies, see `Getting started with conda`_... _`Getting started with conda`: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html.. _conda: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/.. _conda-forge: https://conda-forge.org/Using ``pip``-------------To install GerryChain from PyPI_, run ``pip install gerrychain`` fromthe command line.This approach often fails due to compatibility issues between ourdifferent Python GIS dependencies, like ``geopandas``, ``pyproj``,``fiona``, and ``shapely``. For this reason, we recommend installingfrom conda-forge for most users. .. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/</longdescription>
