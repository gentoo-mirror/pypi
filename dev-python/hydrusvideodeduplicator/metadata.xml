If they are similar, they will be marked as potential duplicates in Hydrus.The accuracy is extremely good because of [vpdq](https://github.com/facebook/ThreatExchange/tree/main/vpdq). You can adjust the threshold of similarity using `--threshold`. The default is 75%.For more information check out the [wiki](https://github.com/appleappleapplenanner/hydrus-video-deduplicator/wiki) and the [FAQ](https://github.com/appleappleapplenanner/hydrus-video-deduplicator/wiki/faq)---## Installation:#### Dependencies:- Python &gt;=3.10- FFmpeg```shpython3 -m pip install hydrusvideodeduplicator```---## [Usage:](https://github.com/appleappleapplenanner/hydrus-video-deduplicator/wiki/Usage)```shpython3 -m hydrusvideodeduplicator --api-key=&quot;&lt;your key&gt;&quot;```---## TODO:- [ ] Option to rollback and remove potential duplicates- [ ] OR predicates for --query- [ ] Parallelize hashing and duplicate search- [ ] Automatically generate access key with Hydrus API- [x] Docker container- [ ] Upload Docker container to Docker Hub (GitHub Action)- [x] Pure Python port of vpdq- [x] Windows compatibility without WSL or DockerPlease create an issue on Github if you have any problems or questions!
