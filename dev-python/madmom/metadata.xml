	<longdescription>======madmom======Madmom is an audio signal processing library written in Python with a strongfocus on music information retrieval (MIR) tasks.The library is internally used by the Department of Computational Perception,Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria (http://www.cp.jku.at) and theAustrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (OFAI), Vienna, Austria(http://www.ofai.at).Possible acronyms are:- Madmom Analyzes Digitized Music Of Musicians- Mostly Audio / Dominantly Music Oriented ModulesIt includes reference implementations for some music information retrievalalgorithms, please see the `References`_ section.Documentation=============Documentation of the package can be found online http://madmom.readthedocs.orgLicense=======The package has two licenses, one for source code and one for model/data files.Source code-----------Unless indicated otherwise, all source code files are published under the BSDlicense. For details, please see the `LICENSE &lt;LICENSE&gt;`_ file.Model and data files--------------------Unless indicated otherwise, all model and data files are distributed under the`Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0&lt;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode&gt;`_ license.If you want to include any of these files (or a variation or modificationthereof) or technology which utilises them in a commercial product, pleasecontact `Gerhard Widmer &lt;http://www.cp.jku.at/people/widmer/&gt;`_.Installation============Please do not try to install from the .zip files provided by GitHub. Ratherinstall it from package (if you just want to use it) or source (if you plan touse it for development) by following the instructions below. Whichever variantyou choose, please make sure that all prerequisites are installed.Prerequisites-------------To install the ``madmom`` package, you must have either Python 2.7 or Python3.3 or newer and the following packages installed:- `numpy &lt;http://www.numpy.org&gt;`_- `scipy &lt;http://www.scipy.org&gt;`_- `cython &lt;http://www.cython.org&gt;`_- `mido &lt;https://github.com/olemb/mido&gt;`_ (for MIDI handling)- `pytest &lt;https://www.pytest.org/&gt;`_ (to run the tests)- `pyaudio &lt;http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/&gt;`_ (to process live  audio input)- `pyfftw &lt;https://github.com/pyFFTW/pyFFTW/&gt;`_ (for better FFT performance)If you need support for audio files other than ``.wav`` with a sample rate of44.1kHz and 16 bit depth, you need ``ffmpeg`` (``avconv`` on Ubuntu Linux hassome decoding bugs, so we advise not to use it!).Please refer to the `requirements.txt &lt;requirements.txt&gt;`_ file for the minimumrequired versions and make sure that these modules are up to date, otherwise itcan result in unexpected errors or false computations!Install from package--------------------The instructions given here should be used if you just want to install thepackage, e.g. to run the bundled programs or use some functionality for yourown project. If you intend to change anything within the `madmom` package,please follow the steps in the next section.The easiest way to install the package is via ``pip`` from the `PyPI (PythonPackage Index) &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi&gt;`_::    pip install madmomThis includes the latest code and trained models and will install alldependencies automatically.You might need higher privileges (use su or sudo) to install the package, modelfiles and scripts globally. Alternatively you can install the package locally(i.e. only for you) by adding the ``--user`` argument::    pip install --user madmomThis will also install the executable programs to a common place (e.g.``/usr/local/bin``), which should be in your ``$PATH`` already. If youinstalled the package locally, the programs will be copied to a folder whichmight not be included in your ``$PATH`` (e.g. ``~/Library/Python/2.7/bin``on Mac OS X or ``~/.local/bin`` on Ubuntu Linux, ``pip`` will tell you). Thusthe programs need to be called explicitely or you can add their install pathto your ``$PATH`` environment variable::    export PATH='path/to/scripts':$PATHInstall from source-------------------If you plan to use the package as a developer, clone the Git repository::    git clone --recursive https://github.com/CPJKU/madmom.gitSince the pre-trained model/data files are not included in this repository butrather added as a Git submodule, you either have to clone the repo recursively.This is equivalent to these steps::    git clone https://github.com/CPJKU/madmom.git    cd madmom    git submodule update --init --remoteThen you can simply install the package in development mode::    python setup.py develop --userTo run the included tests::    python setup.py pytestUpgrade of existing installations---------------------------------To upgrade the package, please use the same mechanism (pip vs. source) as youdid for installation. If you want to change from package to source, pleaseuninstall the package first.Upgrade a package~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Simply upgrade the package via pip::    pip install --upgrade madmom [--user]If some of the provided programs or models changed (please refer to theCHANGELOG) you should first uninstall the package and then reinstall::    pip uninstall madmom    pip install madmom [--user]Upgrade from source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Simply pull the latest sources::    git pullTo update the models contained in the submodule::    git submodule updateIf any of the ``.pyx`` or ``.pxd`` files changed, you have to recompile themodules with Cython::    python setup.py build_ext --inplacePackage structure-----------------The package has a very simple structure, divided into the following folders:`/bin &lt;bin&gt;`_  this folder includes example programs (i.e. executable algorithms)`/docs &lt;docs&gt;`_  package documentation`/madmom &lt;madmom&gt;`_  the actual Python package`/madmom/audio &lt;madmom/audio&gt;`_  low level features (e.g. audio file handling, STFT)`/madmom/evaluation &lt;madmom/evaluation&gt;`_  evaluation code`/madmom/features &lt;madmom/features&gt;`_  higher level features (e.g. onsets, beats)`/madmom/ml &lt;madmom/ml&gt;`_  machine learning stuff (e.g. RNNs, HMMs)`/madmom/models &lt;../../../madmom_models&gt;`_  pre-trained model/data files (see the License section)`/madmom/utils &lt;madmom/utils&gt;`_  misc stuff (e.g. MIDI and general file handling)`/tests &lt;tests&gt;`_  testsExecutable programs-------------------The package includes executable programs in the `/bin &lt;bin&gt;`_ folder.If you installed the package, they were copied to a common place.All scripts can be run in different modes: in ``single`` file mode to processa single audio file and write the output to STDOUT or the given output file::    DBNBeatTracker single [-o OUTFILE] INFILEIf multiple audio files should be processed, the scripts can also be run in``batch`` mode to write the outputs to files with the given suffix::    DBNBeatTracker batch [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [-s OUTPUT_SUFFIX] FILESIf no output directory is given, the program writes the output files to thesame location as the audio files.Some programs can also be run in ``online`` mode, i.e. operate on live audiosignals. This requires `pyaudio &lt;http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/&gt;`_to be installed::    DBNBeatTracker online [-o OUTFILE] [INFILE]The ``pickle`` mode can be used to store the used parameters to be able toexactly reproduce experiments.Please note that the program itself as well as the modes have help messages::    DBNBeatTracker -h    DBNBeatTracker single -h    DBNBeatTracker batch -h    DBNBeatTracker online -h    DBNBeatTracker pickle -hwill give different help messages.Additional resources====================Mailing list------------The `mailing list &lt;https://groups.google.com/d/forum/madmom-users&gt;`_ should beused to get in touch with the developers and other users.Wiki----The wiki can be found here: https://github.com/CPJKU/madmom/wikiFAQ---Frequently asked questions can be found here:https://github.com/CPJKU/madmom/wiki/FAQCitation========If you use madmom in your work, please consider citing it:.. code-block:: latex   @inproceedings{madmom,      Title = {{madmom: a new Python Audio and Music Signal Processing Library}},      Author = {B{\&quot;o}ck, Sebastian and Korzeniowski, Filip and Schl{\&quot;u}ter, Jan and Krebs, Florian and Widmer, Gerhard},      Booktitle = {Proceedings of the 24th ACM International Conference on      Multimedia},      Month = {10},      Year = {2016},      Pages = {1174--1178},      Address = {Amsterdam, The Netherlands},      Doi = {10.1145/2964284.2973795}   }References==========..
