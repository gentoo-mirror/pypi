	<longdescription>AISCOT - AIS Cursor on Target Gateway*************************************.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ampledata/aiscot/main/docs/screenshot_1676076870_2962.png   :alt: Screenshot of AIS as COT PLI in ATAK.   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ampledata/aiscot/main/docs/screenshot_1676076870_2962.pngDescription===========The Automatic Identification System to Cursor on Target gateway (AISCOT) transforms automatic identification system (AIS) to Cursor on Target (CoT) for use with TAK products such as ATAK, WinTAK &amp; iTAK. Vessels sending AIS either over the air (RF), through a local networks (NMEA), or through internet aggregators (AISHUB), will be displayed in TAK with appropriate icons, attitude, type, track, bearing, speed, callsign and more.For more information the TAK Product suite, see: https://ww.tak.govAISCOT was original developed to support an open ocean boat race in the Northern Pacific Ocean, as described in this article: http://ampledata.org/boat_race_support.htmlConcept of Operations=====================AISCOT can operate in two different modes, as described in detail below:1. AIS Over-the-air (RF)2. AIS Aggregator (AISHUB)**AIS Over-the-air Operation (RF)**.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ampledata/aiscot/main/docs/aiscot_ota.png   :alt: AISCOT &quot;AIS Over the Air&quot; OperationReceive AIS data from a VHF AIS receiver, such as the Megwatt `dAISy+ &lt;https://shop.wegmatt.com/products/daisy-ais-receiver&gt;`_. From there AIS can be decoded by `AIS Dispatcher &lt;https://www.aishub.net/ais-dispatcher&gt;`_ and forwarded to AISCOT to be transformed to COT and transmitted to COT destinations.**AIS Aggregator Operation (AISHUB.com)**.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ampledata/aiscot/main/docs/aiscot_agg.png   :alt: AISCOT &quot;AIS Aggregator&quot; OperationReceive AIS data from the `AISHUB &lt;https://www.aishub.com&gt;`_ service. Requires a subscription to AISHUB.Support Development===================.. image:: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png    :target: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ampledata    :alt: Support Development: Buy me a coffee!Installation============**AISCOT requires Python 3.6 or above.**AISCOT functionality is provided by a command-line tool called ``aiscot``, which can be installed several ways.Installing as a Debian/Ubuntu Package [Use Me!]::    $ wget https://github.com/ampledata/pytak/releases/latest/download/python3-pytak_latest_all.deb    $ sudo apt install -f ./python3-pytak_latest_all.deb    $ wget https://github.com/ampledata/aiscot/releases/latest/download/python3-aiscot_latest_all.deb    $ sudo apt install -f ./python3-aiscot_latest_all.debInstall from the Python Package Index [Alternative]::    $ python3 -m pip install -U pytak    $ python3 -m pip install -U aiscotInstall from this source tree [Developer]::    $ git clone https://github.com/ampledata/aiscot.git    $ cd aiscot/    $ python3 setup.py aiscotUsage=====AISCOT can be configured with a INI-style configuration file, or using environmental variables.Command-line options::    usage: aiscot [-h] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-p PREF_PACKAGE]    optional arguments:    -h, --help            show this help message and exit    -c CONFIG_FILE, --CONFIG_FILE CONFIG_FILE                            Optional configuration file. Default: config.ini    -p PREF_PACKAGE, --PREF_PACKAGE PREF_PACKAGE                            Optional connection preferences package zip file (aka Data Package).Configuration options:    ``COT_URL`` : str,  default: udp://239.2.3.1:6969        URL to CoT destination. Must be a URL, e.g. ``tcp://1.2.3.4:1234`` or ``tls://...:1234``, etc. See `PyTAK &lt;https://github.com/ampledata/pytak#configuration-parameters&gt;`_ for options, including TLS support.    ``AIS_PORT`` : int, default: 5050        AIS UDP Listen Port, for use with Over-the-air (RF) AIS.    ``COT_STALE`` : int, default: 3600        CoT Stale period (&quot;timeout&quot;), in seconds. Default `3600` seconds (1 hour).    ``COT_TYPE`` : str, default: a-u-S-X-M        Override COT Event Type (&quot;marker type&quot;).    ``FEED_URL`` : str, optional        AISHUB feed URL. See **AISHUB usage notes** in README below.    ``KNOWN_CRAFT`` : str, optional        Known Craft hints file. CSV file containing callsign/marker hints.    ``INCLUDE_ALL_CRAFT`` : bool, optional        If using KNOWN_CRAFT, still include other craft not in our KNOWN_CRAFT list.    ``IGNORE_ATON`` : bool, optional        IF SET- adsbcot will ignore AIS from Aids to Naviation (buoys, etc).See example-config.ini in the source tree for example configuration.**AISHUB usage notes**AISHUB.com requires registration. Once registered the site will provide you with aUsername that you'll use with their feed. You'll also need to specify a Bounding Box when accessing the feed. The AISHUB_URL must be specified as follows:``https://data.aishub.net/ws.php?format=1&amp;output=json&amp;compress=0&amp;username=AISHUB_USERNAME&amp;latmin=BBOX_LAT_MIN&amp;latmax=BBOX_LAT_MAX&amp;lonmin=BBOX_LON_MON&amp;lonmax=BBOX_LON_MAX``Replacing ``AISHUB_USERNAME`` with your AISHUB.com username, and specifying the Bounding Box is specified as follows:latmin : signed float    The minimum latitude of the Bounding Box (degrees from Equator) as a signed float     (use negative sign for East: ``-``).latmax : signed float    The maximum latitude of the Bounding Box (degrees from Equator) as a signed float    (use negative sign for East: ``-``).lonmin : signed float    The minimum longitude of the Bound Box (degrees from Prime Meridian) as a signed float    (use negative sign for North: ``-``).lonmax : signed float    The maximum longitude of the Bound Box (degrees from Prime Meridian) as a signed float     (use negative sign for North: ``-``).For example, the following Bound Box paints a large swath around Northern California: ``latmin=35&amp;latmax=38&amp;lonmin=-124&amp;lonmax=-121``. This can be read as: &quot;Between 35째 and 38째 latitude &amp; -121째 and -124째 longitude&quot;.Example Setup=============The following diagram shows an example setup of AISCOT utilizing a dAISy+ AIS receiver with an outboard Marine VHF antenna, a Raspberry Pi running aisdispatcher and AISCOT, forwarding COT to a TAK Server and WinTAK &amp; ATAK clients.
