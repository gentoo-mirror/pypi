A list of the developed systems is included in QSDsan's `documentation &lt;https://qsdsan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Developed_Systems.html&gt;`_. Please refer to the individual README files within each system module for loading instructions and exemplary results.Installation------------The easiest way is through ``pip``, in your command-line interface (e.g., Anaconda prompt, terminal):.. code:: bash    pip install exposanIf you need to upgrade:.. code::    pip install -U exposanor for a specific version (replace X.X.X with the version number):.. code::    pip install exposan==X.X.XIf you want to install the latest GitHub version at the `main branch &lt;https://github.com/qsd-group/exposan&gt;`_ (note that you can still use the ``-U`` flag for upgrading):.. code::    pip install git+https://github.com/QSD-Group/EXPOsan.git.. note::   If this doesn't give you the newest ``exposan``, try ``pip uninstall exposan`` first.   Also, you may need to update some ``exposan``'s dependency package (e.g., ' ``qsdsan``, ``biosteam``, ``thermosteam``) versions in order for the new ``exposan`` to run.or other fork and/or branch (replace ``&lt;USERNAME_OF_THE_FORK&gt;`` and ``&lt;BRANCH_NAME&gt;`` with the desired fork and branch names).. code::    pip install git+https://github.com/&lt;USERNAME_OF_THE_FORK&gt;/EXPOsan.git@&lt;BRANCH_NAME&gt;You can also download the package from `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/exposan/&gt;`_.To get the git version (use the ``depth`` flag to choose how many commit histories you want to clone):.. code:: bash    git clone https://github.com/QSD-Group/EXPOsan.git --depth=1then navigate into the repository (``cd EXPOsan``) and install the required packages:.. code:: bash    pip install â€“r requirements.txt.. note::      Using the ``depth`` flag will only clone the main branch by default, if there are other branches and you want them, then use the ``no-single-branch`` flag, i.e.   .. code:: bash       git clone https://github.com/&lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;/EXPOsan.git --depth=1 --no-single-branchAuthors and Contributing------------------------``EXPOsan`` is developed by the Quantitative Sustainable Design Group led by members of the `Guest Group &lt;http://engineeringforsustainability.com/&gt;`_ and `other developers &lt;https://github.com/QSD-Group/EXPOsan/graphs/contributors&gt;`_ that have contributed to the repository. `Yalin Li &lt;https://qsdsan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/authors/Yalin_Li.html&gt;`_) is the currently maintainer of this repository and package.Please refer to the `Contributing to QSDsan &lt;https://qsdsan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html&gt;`_ section of the documentation for instructions and guidelines.
