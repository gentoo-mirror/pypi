For more information, see the[IBM Research blog](https://research.ibm.com/blog/120x-quantum-speedup).This module provides the interface to access Qiskit Runtime.## InstallationYou can install this package using pip:```bashpip install qiskit-ibm-runtime```## Account Setup### Qiskit Runtime on IBM CloudQiskit Runtime is now part of the IBM Quantum Services on IBM Cloud. To use this service, you'llneed to create an IBM Cloud account and a quantum service instance.[This guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-get-started)contains step-by-step instructions on setting this up, including directions to find yourIBM Cloud API key and Cloud Resource Name (CRN), which you will need for authentication.### Qiskit Runtime on IBM QuantumPrior to becoming an IBM Cloud service, Qiskit Runtime was offered on IBM Quantum. If you have anexisting IBM Quantum account, you can continue using Qiskit Runtime on IBM Quantum.You will need your IBM Quantum API token to authenticate with the Qiskit Runtime service:1. Create an IBM Quantum account or log in to your existing account by visiting the [IBM Quantum login page].1. Copy (and optionally regenerate) your API token from your   [IBM Quantum account page].### Saving Account on DiskOnce you have the account credentials, you can save them on disk, so you won't have to inputthem each time. The credentials are saved in the `$HOME/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json` file, where `$HOME` is your home directory.| :warning: Account credentials are saved in plain text, so only do so if you are using a trusted device. ||:---------------------------| ```pythonfrom qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService# Save an IBM Cloud account.QiskitRuntimeService.save_account(channel=&quot;ibm_cloud&quot;, token=&quot;MY_IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY&quot;, instance=&quot;MY_IBM_CLOUD_CRN&quot;)# Save an IBM Quantum account.QiskitRuntimeService.save_account(channel=&quot;ibm_quantum&quot;, token=&quot;MY_IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN&quot;)```Once the account is saved on disk, you can instantiate the service without any arguments:```pythonfrom qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeServiceservice = QiskitRuntimeService()```### Loading Account from Environment VariablesAlternatively, the service can discover credentials from environment variables:```bashexport QISKIT_IBM_TOKEN=&quot;MY_IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY&quot;export QISKIT_IBM_INSTANCE=&quot;MY_IBM_CLOUD_CRN&quot;export QISKIT_IBM_CHANNEL=&quot;ibm_cloud&quot;```Then instantiate the service without any arguments:```pythonfrom qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeServiceservice = QiskitRuntimeService()```### Enabling Account for Current Python SessionAs another alternative, you can also enable an account just for the current session by instantiating theservice with your credentials.```pythonfrom qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService# For an IBM Cloud account.ibm_cloud_service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel=&quot;ibm_cloud&quot;, token=&quot;MY_IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY&quot;, instance=&quot;MY_IBM_CLOUD_CRN&quot;)# For an IBM Quantum account.ibm_quantum_service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel=&quot;ibm_quantum&quot;, token=&quot;MY_IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN&quot;)```## Qiskit Runtime SessionA Qiskit Runtime **session** allows a collection of jobs to be grouped and jointly scheduled by the Qiskit Runtime service, facilitating iterative use of quantum computers without incurring queuing delays on each iteration. A session is started when the first job within the session is started, and subsequent jobs within the session are prioritized by the scheduler.You can use the [`qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session`](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/blob/main/qiskit_ibm_runtime/session.py) class to start asession. There are some examples in the sections below.## Primitives**Primitives** are base level operations that serve as building blocks for many quantum algorithms and applications. The [primitive interfaces](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/primitives.html) are defined in Qiskit Terra, and many Qiskit algorithms use the primitives natively. This abstraction allows you to write the same code, using Qiskit algorithms or otherwise, that can run on different quantum hardware or simulators without having to explicitly manage some of the finer details.There are currently two primitives defined in Qiskit: `Estimator` and `Sampler`. Qiskit Runtime service offers these primitives with additional features, such as built-in error suppression and mitigation.There are several different options you can specify when calling the primitives. See [`qiskit_ibm_runtime.Options`](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/blob/main/qiskit_ibm_runtime/options.py#L103) class for more information.### SamplerThis is a primitive that takes a list of user circuits as an input and generates an error-mitigated readout of quasi-probabilities. This provides users a way to better evaluate shot results using error mitigation and enables them to more efficiently evaluate the possibility of multiple relevant data points in the context of destructive interference.To invoke the `Sampler` primitive within a session:```pythonfrom qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Session, Options, Samplerfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuitservice = QiskitRuntimeService()options = Options(optimization_level=1)options.execution.shots = 1024  # Options can be set using auto-complete.bell = QuantumCircuit(2)bell.h(0)bell.cx(0, 1)bell.measure_all()with Session(service=service, backend=&quot;ibmq_qasm_simulator&quot;) as session:    sampler = Sampler(session=session, options=options)    job = sampler.run(circuits=bell)    print(f&quot;Job ID is {job.job_id()}&quot;)    print(f&quot;Job result is {job.result()}&quot;)    # You can make additional calls to Sampler and/or Estimator.```### EstimatorThis is a primitive that takes circuits and observables to evaluate expectation values and variances for a given parameter input. This primitive allows users to efficiently calculate and interpret expectation values of quantum operators required for many algorithms.To invoke the `Estimator` primitive within a session:```pythonfrom qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Session, Options, Estimatorfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuitfrom qiskit.circuit.library import RealAmplitudesfrom qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOpservice = QiskitRuntimeService()options = Options(optimization_level=1)options.execution.shots = 1024  # Options can be set using auto-complete.psi1 = RealAmplitudes(num_qubits=2, reps=2)H1 = SparsePauliOp.from_list([(&quot;II&quot;, 1), (&quot;IZ&quot;, 2), (&quot;XI&quot;, 3)])theta1 = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]with Session(service=service, backend=&quot;ibmq_qasm_simulator&quot;) as session:    estimator = Estimator(session=session, options=options)    # calculate [ &lt;psi1(theta1)|H1|psi1(theta1)&gt; ]    job = estimator.run(circuits=[psi1], observables=[H1], parameter_values=[theta1])    print(f&quot;Job ID is {job.job_id()}&quot;)    print(f&quot;Job result is {job.result()}&quot;)    # You can make additional calls to Sampler and/or Estimator.```## Accessing your IBM Quantum backendsA **backend** is a quantum device or simulator capable of running quantum circuits or pulse schedules.You can query for the backends you have access to. Attributes and methods of the returned instancesprovide information, such as qubit counts, error rates, and statuses, of the backends.```pythonfrom qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeServiceservice = QiskitRuntimeService()# Display all backends you have access.print(service.backends())# Get a specific backend.backend = service.backend('ibmq_qasm_simulator')# Print backend coupling map.print(backend.coupling_map)```## Next StepsNow you're set up and ready to check out some of the [tutorials].## Contribution GuidelinesIf you'd like to contribute to qiskit-ibm-runtime, please take a look at our[contribution guidelines].
