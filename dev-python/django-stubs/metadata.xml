Django uses some Python &quot;magic&quot; that makes having precise types for some code patterns problematic. This is why we need this project. The final goal is to be able to get precise types for most common patterns.## Installation```bashpip install django-stubs[compatible-mypy]```To make mypy aware of the plugin, you need to add```ini[mypy]plugins =    mypy_django_plugin.main[mypy.plugins.django-stubs]django_settings_module = &quot;myproject.settings&quot;```in your `mypy.ini` or `setup.cfg` [file](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_file.html).[pyproject.toml](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#using-a-pyproject-toml-file) configurations are also supported:```toml[tool.mypy]plugins = [&quot;mypy_django_plugin.main&quot;][tool.django-stubs]django_settings_module = &quot;myproject.settings&quot;```Two things happening here:1. We need to explicitly list our plugin to be loaded by `mypy`2. Our plugin also requires `django` settings module (what you put into `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` variable) to be specifiedThis fully working [typed boilerplate](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-django-template) can serve you as an example.## Version compatibilityWe rely on different `django` and `mypy` versions:| django-stubs   | Mypy version | Django version | Django partial support | Python version ||----------------|--------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------|| 4.2.3          | 1.4.x        | 4.2            | 4.1, 3.2               | 3.8 - 3.11     || 4.2.2          | 1.4.x        | 4.2            | 4.1, 3.2               | 3.8 - 3.11     || 4.2.1          | 1.3.x        | 4.2            | 4.1, 3.2               | 3.8 - 3.11     || 4.2.0          | 1.2.x        | 4.2            | 4.1, 4.0, 3.2          | 3.7 - 3.11     || 1.16.0         | 1.1.x        | 4.1            | 4.0, 3.2               | 3.7 - 3.11     || 1.15.0         | 1.0.x        | 4.1            | 4.0, 3.2               | 3.7 - 3.11     || 1.14.0         | 0.990+       | 4.1            | 4.0, 3.2               | 3.7 - 3.11     |## Features### Type checking of Model Meta attributesBy inheriting from the `TypedModelMeta` class, you can ensure you're using correct types forattributes:```pythonfrom django.db import modelsfrom django_stubs_ext.db.models import TypedModelMetaclass MyModel(models.Model):    example = models.CharField(max_length=100)    class Meta(TypedModelMeta):        ordering = [&quot;example&quot;]        constraints = [            models.UniqueConstraint(fields=[&quot;example&quot;], name=&quot;unique_example&quot;),        ]```### Other typed base classes* `django_stubs_ext.db.router.TypedDatabaseRouter` can be used as base when implementing custom database routers.## Settingsdjango-stubs has a few settings, which you can list in:* `pyproject.toml`, under the table `[tool.django-stubs]`* `mypy.ini` under the table `[mypy.plugins.django-stubs]`The supported settings are:- `django_settings_module`, a string.  Specify the import path of your settings module, the same as Djangoâ€™s [`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/settings/#designating-the-settings).- `strict_settings`, a boolean, default `true`.  Set to `false` if using dynamic settings, as [described below](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs#how-to-use-a-custom-library-to-handle-django-settings).## FAQ### Is this an official Django project?No, it is not. We are independent from Django at the moment.There's a [proposal](https://github.com/django/deps/pull/65) to merge our project into the Django itself.You can show your support by liking the PR.### Is it safe to use this in production?Yes, it is! This project does not affect your runtime at all.It only affects `mypy` type checking process.But, it does not make any sense to use this project without `mypy`.### mypy crashes when I run it with this plugin installedThe current implementation uses Django's runtime to extract information about models, so it might crash if your installed apps or `models.py` are broken.In other words, if your `manage.py runserver` crashes, mypy will crash too.You can also run `mypy` with [`--tb`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-show-traceback)option to get extra information about the error.### I cannot use QuerySet or Manager with type annotationsYou can get a `TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable`when you will try to use `QuerySet[MyModel]`, `Manager[MyModel]` or some other Django-based Generic types.This happens because these Django classes do not support [`__class_getitem__`](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0560/#class-getitem) magic method in runtime.1. You can go with our [`django_stubs_ext`](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs/tree/master/django_stubs_ext) helper, that patches all the types we use as Generic in django.   Install it:   ```bash   pip install django-stubs-ext  # as a production dependency   ```   And then place in your top-level settings:   ```python   import django_stubs_ext   django_stubs_ext.monkeypatch()   ```   You can add extra types to patch with `django_stubs_ext.monkeypatch(extra_classes=[YourDesiredType])`2. You can use strings instead: `'QuerySet[MyModel]'` and `'Manager[MyModel]'`, this way it will work as a type for `mypy` and as a regular `str` in runtime.### How can I create a HttpRequest that's guaranteed to have an authenticated user?Django's built in [`HttpRequest`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest) has the attribute `user` that resolves to the type```pythonUnion[User, AnonymousUser]```where `User` is the user model specified by the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting.If you want a `HttpRequest` that you can type-annotate with where you know that the user is authenticated you can subclass the normal `HttpRequest` class like so:```pythonfrom django.http import HttpRequestfrom my_user_app.models import MyUserclass AuthenticatedHttpRequest(HttpRequest):    user: MyUser```And then use `AuthenticatedHttpRequest` instead of the standard `HttpRequest` for when you know that the user is authenticated. For example in views using the `@login_required` decorator.### My QuerySet methods are returning Any rather than my ModelIf you are using `MyQuerySet.as_manager()`:Example:```pythonfrom django.db import modelsclass MyModelQuerySet(models.QuerySet):    passclass MyModel(models.Model):    bar = models.IntegerField()    objects = MyModelQuerySet.as_manager()def use_my_model() -&gt; int:    foo = MyModel.objects.get(id=1) # Should now be `MyModel`    return foo.xyz # Gives an error```Or if you're using `Manager.from_queryset`:Example:```pythonfrom django.db import modelsclass MyModelQuerySet(models.QuerySet):    passMyModelManager = models.Manager.from_queryset(MyModelQuerySet)class MyModel(models.Model):    bar = models.IntegerField()    objects = MyModelManager()def use_my_model() -&gt; int:    foo = MyModel.objects.get(id=1) # Should now be `MyModel`    return foo.xyz # Gives an error```### Why am I getting incompatible return type errors on my custom managers?If you declare your custom managers without generics and override built-inmethods you might see an error message about incompatible error messages,something like this:```pythonfrom django.db import modelsclass MyManager(model.Manager):    def create(self, **kwargs) -&gt; &quot;MyModel&quot;:        pass```will cause this error message:&gt; error: Return type &quot;MyModel&quot; of &quot;create&quot; incompatible with return type &quot;_T&quot; in supertype &quot;BaseManager&quot;This is happening because the `Manager` class is generic, but withoutspecifying generics the built-in manager methods are expected to return thegeneric type of the base manager, which is any model. To fix this issue youshould declare your manager with your model as the type variable:```pythonclass MyManager(models.Manager[&quot;MyModel&quot;]):    ...```### How do I annotate cases where I called QuerySet.annotate?Django-stubs provides a special type, `django_stubs_ext.WithAnnotations[Model]`, which indicates that the `Model` hasbeen annotated, meaning it allows getting/setting extra attributes on the model instance.Optionally, you can provide a `TypedDict` of these attributes,e.g. `WithAnnotations[MyModel, MyTypedDict]`, to specify which annotated attributes are present.Currently, the mypy plugin can recognize that specific names were passed to `QuerySet.annotate` andinclude them in the type, but does not record the types of these attributes.The knowledge of the specific annotated fields is not yet used in creating more specific types for `QuerySet`'s`values`, `values_list`, or `filter` methods, however knowledge that the model was annotated _is_ used to create abroader type result type for `values`/`values_list`, and to allow `filter`ing on any field.```pythonfrom typing import TypedDictfrom django_stubs_ext import WithAnnotationsfrom django.db import modelsfrom django.db.models.expressions import Valueclass MyModel(models.Model):    username = models.CharField(max_length=100)def func(m: WithAnnotations[MyModel]) -&gt; str:    return m.asdf  # OK, since the model is annotated as allowing any attributefunc(MyModel.objects.annotate(foo=Value(&quot;&quot;)).get(id=1))  # OKfunc(    MyModel.objects.get(id=1))  # Error, since this model will not allow access to any attributeclass MyTypedDict(TypedDict):    foo: strdef func2(m: WithAnnotations[MyModel, MyTypedDict]) -&gt; str:    print(m.bar)  # Error, since field &quot;bar&quot; is not in MyModel or MyTypedDict.    return m.foo  # OK, since we said field &quot;foo&quot; was allowedfunc(MyModel.objects.annotate(foo=Value(&quot;&quot;)).get(id=1))  # OKfunc(MyModel.objects.annotate(bar=Value(&quot;&quot;)).get(id=1))  # Error```### How do I check if something is an instance of QuerySet in runtime?A limitation of making `QuerySet` generic is that you can not useit for `isinstance` checks.```pythonfrom django.db.models.query import QuerySetdef foo(obj: object) -&gt; None:    if isinstance(obj, QuerySet): # Error: Parameterized generics cannot be used with class or instance checks        ...```To get around with this issue without making `QuerySet` non-generic,Django-stubs provides `django_stubs_ext.QuerySetAny`, a non-genericvariant of `QuerySet` suitable for runtime type checking:```pythonfrom django_stubs_ext import QuerySetAnydef foo(obj: object) -&gt; None:    if isinstance(obj, QuerySetAny):  # OK        ...```### Why am I getting incompatible argument type mentioning `_StrPromise`?The lazy translation functions of Django (such as `gettext_lazy`) return a `Promise` instead of `str`. These two types [cannot be used interchangeably](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs/pull/1139#issuecomment-1232167698). The return type of these functions was therefore [changed](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs/pull/689) to reflect that.If you encounter this error in your own code, you can either cast the `Promise` to `str` (causing the translation to be evaluated), or use the `StrPromise` or `StrOrPromise` types from `django-stubs-ext` in type hints. Which solution to choose depends depends on the particular case. See [working with lazy translation objects](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/i18n/translation/#working-with-lazy-translation-objects) in the Django documentation for more information.If this is reported on Django code, please report an issue or open a pull request to fix the type hints.### How to use a custom library to handle Django settings?Using something like [`django-split-settings`](https://github.com/wemake-services/django-split-settings) or [`django-configurations`](https://github.com/jazzband/django-configurations) will make it hard for mypy to infer your settings.This might also be the case when using something like:```pythontry:    from .local_settings import *except Exception:    pass```So, mypy would not like this code:```pythonfrom django.conf import settingssettings.CUSTOM_VALUE  # E: 'Settings' object has no attribute 'CUSTOM_SETTING'```To handle this corner case we have a special setting `strict_settings` (`True` by default),you can switch it to `False` to always return `Any` and not raise any errors if runtime settings module has the given value,for example `pyproject.toml`:```toml[tool.django-stubs]strict_settings = false```or `mypy.ini`:```ini[mypy.plugins.django-stubs]strict_settings = false```And then:```python# Works:reveal_type(settings.EXISTS_IN_RUNTIME)  # N: Any# Errors:reveal_type(settings.MISSING)  # E: 'Settings' object has no attribute 'MISSING'```## Related projects- [`awesome-python-typing`](https://github.com/typeddjango/awesome-python-typing) - Awesome list of all typing-related things in Python.- [`djangorestframework-stubs`](https://github.com/typeddjango/djangorestframework-stubs) - Stubs for Django REST Framework.- [`pytest-mypy-plugins`](https://github.com/typeddjango/pytest-mypy-plugins) - `pytest` plugin that we use for testing `mypy` stubs and plugins.- [`wemake-django-template`](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-django-template) - Create new typed Django projects in seconds.## To get helpWe have Gitter here: &lt;https://gitter.im/mypy-django/Lobby&gt;If you think you have more generic typing issue, please refer to &lt;https://github.com/python/mypy&gt; and their Gitter.## ContributingThis project is open source and community driven.
