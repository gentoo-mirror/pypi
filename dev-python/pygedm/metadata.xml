J., 835, 29](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/29/meta);[arXiv:1610.09448](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09448)) YMW16 electron density model, is written in C++, and the Cordes and Lazio (2001, [arXiv:0207156](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/)) NE2001 model is written in FORTRAN. This package, PyGEDM, wraps thesetwo codes using [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html) to make them usable from Python. Here, we have converted NE2001 to C++ using `f2c`.### Web appWe provide a web app at https://apps.datacentral.org.au/pygedm/ The pygedm web app is kindly hosted by [Data Central](https://datacentral.org.au/).### UsageSome usage examples can be found in the [examples directory](https://github.com/telegraphic/pygedm/tree/master/examples). ```pythonimport pygedm# calculate DM at a given distanceDM, tau_sc = pygedm.dist_to_dm(204.0, -6.5, 200, method='ne2001')DM, tau_sc = pygedm.dist_to_dm(204.0, -6.5, 200, method='ymw16')# calculate distance for a given sky position and DMdist, tau_sc = pygedm.dm_to_dist(123.4, 4.0, 200)# calculate N_e density at xyz galactocentric coordinatesne = pygedm.calculate_electron_density_xyz(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)# calculate N_e density at Galactic lat/long/distance coordsne = pygedm.calculate_electron_density_lbr(204.0, -6.5, 3000.0)# Calculate halo DM contributiondm_halo = pygedm.calculate_halo_dm(gl=0, gb=30)```The methods return astropy [Quantities](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/quantity.html#quantity), which have units attached, and can accept astropy [Angles](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/angles.html#working-with-angles) and Quantities as arguments:```pythonimport pygedmimport astropy.units as uimport astropy.coordinates as cDM = u.Quantity(10.0, unit='pc cm^-3')ra, dec = c.Angle(23.0, unit='hourangle'), c.Angle('-43:00:02', unit='degree')sky_coords = c.SkyCoord(ra, dec, frame='icrs')dist, tau_sc = pygedm.dm_to_dist(sky_coords.galactic.l, sky_coords.galactic.b, DM)print(dist.to('lyr'))&gt;&gt; 3362.16343117 lyrprint(tau_sc.to('ns'))&gt;&gt; 7.758686138 ns```### InstallationRequires `pybind11`, `astropy`, `numpy`, `scipy`, a newish C compiler with C++11 support (Ubuntu 16.04+ default gcc will work), plus `f2c`. Pre-compiled wheels are generated for linux, meaning you can skip the `f2c` install step. Alternatively you can install via `apt-get f2c` in Ubuntu, or  via `conda install -c conda-forge f2c` if you use conda.For MacOS, you are best off using `conda` and getting `f2c` via `conda install -c conda-forge f2c`. Windows is not currently supported.You should be able to install with:```pip install pygedm```or ```pip install git+https://github.com/telegraphic/pygedm```to install the latest version from github. Alternatively, download this repository and install via```pip install .```To run unit tests, run `python setup.py test`. Note that these tests only check the Python bindings, not the underlying C/FORTRAN source code (which is not supplied with unit tests).### ReferencesIf using PyGEDM in a journal article, please remember to cite the underlying electron density models:[Cordes, J.

It isestimated that the 95% of predicted Galactic pulsar distances willhave a relative error of less than a factor of 0.9. Pulse broadeningdue to scattering in the Galactic interstellar medium, the MagellanicClouds, the intergalactic medium and FRB host galaxies is estimated.As well as the ymw16 dm-distance program, we also provide a program,ymw16_ne, which gives the electron density at any point in the Galaxyor Magellanic Clouds.A paper (Yao, Manchester and Wang, 2017,[Astrophys. J., 835, 29](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/29/meta);[arXiv:1610.09448](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09448)) describes the model and compares its predictionswith those of earlier Galactic electron density models. YMW16 is thefirst electron-density model to estimate extragalactic pulsardistances and FRB distances.To make a command-line executable version of the program, download andunpack the latest version of the program. Then run &quot;make_ymw16&quot; tocreate the executable. The environment variable YMW16_DIR may be setup to point at a directory containing ymw16par.txt andspiral.txt. Access to these files is needed at runtime.Websites allowing interactive access to the YMW16 distance model anddownload of the latest program version are available at:* [http://www.xao.ac.cn/ymw16/](http://www.xao.ac.cn/ymw16/),* [http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/ymw16/](http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/ymw16/]) and* [https://bitbucket.org/psrsoft/ymw16/](https://bitbucket.org/psrsoft/ymw16/).Please report any issues or bugs athttps://bitbucket.org/psrsoft/ymw16/issues/new/ or directly to theauthors.
