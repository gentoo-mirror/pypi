	<longdescription># SIL ThotSIL Thot is a C++ library for statistical machine translation and word alignment. This is a fork of the [Thot Toolkit](https://github.com/daormar/thot) developed by Daniel Ortiz-Mart√≠nez. This fork has packaged the original Thot toolkit into a shared library. This allows the functionality to be embedded in other applications. The fork also includes ew alignment models, such as IBM-3, IBM-4, and Fast Align.</longdescription>
