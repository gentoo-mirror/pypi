It has been designed with high extensibility in mind, as detailed in the [Extensions](#extensions) section.Marko requires Python 3.7 or higher.## Why MarkoOf all the Python markdown parsers available, a common issue is the difficulty for users to add their own features. Additionally, both [Python-Markdown][pymd] and [mistune][mistune] do not comply with CommonMark specifications. This has prompted me to develop a new markdown parser.Marko's compliance with the complex CommonMark specification can impact its performance. However, using a parser that does not adhere to this spec may result in unexpected rendering outcomes. According to benchmark results, Marko is three times slower than Python-Markdown but slightly faster than Commonmark-py and significantly slower than mistune. If prioritizing performance over spec compliance is crucial for you, it would be best to opt for another parser.[spec]: https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/[pymd]: https://github.com/waylan/Python-Markdown[mistune]: https://github.com/lepture/mistune[cmpy]: https://github.com/rtfd/CommonMark-py## Use MarkoThe installation is very simple:    $ pip install markoAnd to use it:```pythonimport markoprint(marko.convert(text))```Marko also provides a simple CLI, for example, to render a document and output to a html file:    $ cat my_article.md | marko &gt; my_article.html## ExtensionsIt is super easy to use an extension:```pythonfrom marko import Markdownfrom marko.ext.footnote import make_extension# Add footnote extensionmarkdown = Markdown(extensions=[make_extension()])# Or you can just:markdown = Markdown(extensions=['footnote'])# Alternatively you can register an extension latermarkdown.use(make_extension())```An example of using an extension with the command-line version of Marko:```$ cat this_has_footnote.txt | marko -e footnote &gt; hi_world.html```Marko is shipped with 4 extensions: `'footnote', 'toc' 'pangu', 'codehilite'`.They are not included in CommonMark's spec but are common in other markdown parsers.Marko also provides a Github flavored markdown parser which can be found at `marko.ext.gfm.gfm`.Please refer to [Extend Marko](https://marko-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extend.html) about how towrite your own extension.## LicenseMarko is released under [MIT License](LICENSE)## [Change Log](CHANGELOG.md)</longdescription>
