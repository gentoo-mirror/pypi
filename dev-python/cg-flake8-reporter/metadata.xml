	<longdescription># cg-flake8-reporterA Flae8 reporter plugin for CodeGrade AutoTest v2.This plugin writes messages to CodeGrade AutoTest v2's structured output channel.For each violation Flake8 reports, a `comments` message is written as describedin CodeGrade's documentation. When Flake8 finishes its analysis, a final messageis written with the amount of points that were achieved in the code quality run.## ConfigurationIn order to use the custom reporter, make sure you have installed both Flake8and this package:```bashpython3 -m pip install flake8==6.0.0python3 -m pip install cg-flake8-reporter```This reporter is registered with Flake8 as `cg-flake8-reporter`, to use it runflake with the option `--format=cg-flake8-reporter`.The custom reporter adds a few new options to Flake8: `cg-points-deducted`,`cg-flake8-fd` and `cg-base-path`.### cg-points-deductedThe `cg-points-deducted` option makes it possible to configure the amount ofpoints (in percentage) that each violation deducts from the total points.The `cg-points-deducted` expectes a string in the following format as input:```bash'info:&lt;percentage&gt;,warning:&lt;percentage&gt;,error:&lt;percentage&gt;'```Each of the violation levels must be present in the provided string. Thepercentage provided should be an integer number **without** the `%` symbol.If you wish for a violation level to not deduct points, simply set it to `0`.### cg-flake8-fdThe `cg-flake8-fd` option makes it possible to configure where the reporterwill write its output. By default, the value is `1`, which means the reporterwill write to `stdout`. Within AutoTest v2 it is recommended to use filedescriptor `3` so that the comments will be visible in CodeGrade's UI. The_Flake8_ step will already set this up for you.### cg-base-pathThe `cg-base-path` allows you to restrict which files the reporter will report.For example, if you only want files to be reported within the `server` directoryof the student, you may want to set `--cg-base-path=~/student/server/`. Beware,the _Flake8_ step always sets `cg-base-path` to the root of the student'sworkspace. If you want to customize this, you should use a _Custom Test_ stepinstead.## UsageTo run Flake8 with the custom reporter:```bashpython3 -m flake8 \    --format=cg-flake8-reporter \    --cg-points-deducted='info:1,warning:3,error:5' \    --cg-flake8-fd=1 \    ./```</longdescription>
