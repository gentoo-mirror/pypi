	<longdescription>Welcome to Pyslet=================..  note::    You are reading documentation for the pyslet-0.7.20170805 release of    Pyslet to PyPi. The latest version, corresponding to the GitHub    master is available here__        ..  __: http://pyslet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Pyslet_ is a Python package for Standards in Learning Education andTraining (LET). It implements a number of LET-specific standards,including IMS QTI, Content Packaging and Basic LTI.  It also includessupport for some general standards, including the data access standardOData (see http://www.odata.org)...  _Pyslet: http://www.pyslet.orgPyslet was originally written to be the engine behind the QTI migrationtool but it can be used independently as a support module for your ownPython applications.Full documentation is hosted at http://pyslet.readthedocs.orgPyslet currently supports Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3+, see docs for details.  Distribution------------Pyslet is developed on GitHub: https://github.com/swl10/pyslet but itcan be downloaded and installed from the popular PyPi packagedistribution site: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyslet using *pip*.While Pyslet is being actively developed the version on PyPi may laga few months behind the master branch on GitHub.  The unittests arefairly comprehensive and are automatically run against the masterbranch using TravisCI_:.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/swl10/pyslet.png   :alt: Build Status   :target: https://travis-ci.org/swl10/pyslet.. _TravisCI: https://travis-ci.org/swl10/pysletUsers of older Python builds (e.g., Python 2.6 installed on older OS Xversions) should be aware that pip may well fail to install itself orother modules due to a failure to connect to the PyPi repository. Fixing this is hard and installing from source is recommended instead ifyou are afflicted by this issue.Installing from Source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Pyslet package contains a setup.py script so you can install itby downloading the compressed archive, uncompressing it and thenrunning the following command inside the package::    python setup.py installWindows users should note that when downloading a zipped archive of thedistribution some unittests may fail due to the ambiguity in characterencoding file names in zip archives.  This is not an issue with Pysletitself but an issue with some of the test data in the unittests folder.If you use Git (or GitHub desktop) to checkout the master instead thenthe unittests should work, please report any errors as the continuousbuild system does not catch Windows-specific bugs.Current Status &amp; Road Map~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Pyslet is going through a transition process at the moment as the QTImigration tool that drives its development is gradually moving towardsbeing distributed as an LTI tool rather than a desktop application.The OData support is fairly robust, it is used to run the Cambridge WeatherOData service which can be found at http://odata.pyslet.org/weatherWhat's next?*   OData version 4: this will be a rewrite of the OData modules though    they will ultimately behave in a similar way to the existing    sub-package.    *   MySQL shim for the OData SQL storage model (90% complete and    functional)*   Improved support for LTI to take it beyond 'basic' (60% complete)I also write about Pyslet on my blog:http://swl10.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/PysletFeedback~~~~~~~~The best way to get something changed is to create an issue or Pullrequest on GitHub, however, my contact details are available there on myprofile page if you just want to drop me an email with a suggestion orquestion.License~~~~~~~Pyslet is distributed under the 'New' BSD license:http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause, this decision was inheritedfrom the early days of the code.  Although Copyright to much of thesource is owned by the author personally earlier parts are owned by theUniversity of Cambridge and are marked as such.Pyslet is written and maintained by the main author on a spare timebasis and is not connected to my current employer.Acknowledgements~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Thank you to everyone who has raised issues, questions and pull requestson GitHub!Some historical information is available on the QTI Migration tool'sGoogle Code project:https://code.google.com/p/qtimigration/Some of the code was written in the 1990s and it owes a lot to theUniversity of Cambridge and, in particular, to the team I worked with atUCLES (aka Cambridge Assessment) who were instrumental in getting thisproject started.</longdescription>
