	<longdescription>Group Based Policy (GBP) provides declarative abstractions for achievingscalable intent-based infrastructure automation.GBP complements the OpenStack networking model with the notion of policiesthat can be applied between groups of network endpoints. As users look beyondbasic connectivity, richer network services with diverse implementations andnetwork properties are naturally expressed as policies. Examples includeservice chaining, QoS, path properties, access control, etc.GBP allows application administrators to express their networking requirementsusing a Group and a Policy Rules-Set abstraction. The specifics of policyrendering are left to the underlying pluggable policy driver.GBP model also supports a redirect operation that makes it easy to abstractand consume complex network service chains and graphs.Checkout the GBP wiki page for more detailed information:&lt;http://wiki.openstack.org/GroupBasedPolicy&gt;The latest code is available at:&lt;http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/group-based-policy&gt;.GBP project management (blueprints, bugs) is done via Launchpad:&lt;http://launchpad.net/group-based-policy&gt;For help using or hacking on GBP, you can send mail to&lt;mailto:openstack-dev@lists.openstack.org&gt;.Acronyms used in code for brevity:    PT:  Policy Target    PTG: Policy Target Group    PR:  Policy Rule    PRS: Policy Rule Set    L2P: L2 Policy    L3P: L3 Policy    NSP: Network Service Policy</longdescription>
