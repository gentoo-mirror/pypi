A reasonable amount of effort was put behind Chepy to make it compatible to the various functionalities that CyberChef offers, all in a pure Pythonic manner. There are some key advantages and disadvantages that Chepy has over Cyberchef. The Cyberchef concept of _stacking_ different modules is kept alive in Chepy.There is still a long way to go for Chepy as it does not offer every single ability of Cyberchef.## Feel free to give the project a ⭐️!## Docs[Refer to the docs for full usage information](http://chepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)## Example[For all usage and examples, see the docs.](http://chepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)Chepy has a stacking mechanism similar to Cyberchef. For example, this in Cyberchef:&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securisec/chepy/master/docs/assets/cc_encoding.png&quot; width=400px&gt;This is equivalent to ```pythonfrom chepy import Chepyfile_path = &quot;/tmp/demo/encoding&quot;print(    Chepy(file_path)    .load_file()    .reverse()    .rot_13()    .base64_decode()    .base32_decode()    .hexdump_to_str()    .o)```## Chepy vs Cyberchef#### Advantages- Chepy is pure python with a supporting and accessible python api- Chepy has a CLI- Chepy CLI has full autocompletion.- Supports pe, elf, and other various file format specific parsing.  - Extendable via [plugins](https://chepy-plugins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)- Infinitely scalable as it can leverage the full Python library.- Chepy can interface with the full Cyberchef web app to a certain degree. It is easy to move from Chepy to Cyberchef if need be. - The Chepy python library is significantly faster than the Cyberchef Node library.- Works with HTTP/S requests without CORS issues.#### Disadvantages- Chepy is not a web app (at least for now).- Chepy does not offer every single thing that Cyberchef does- Chepy does not have the `magic` method (at the moment)## InstallationChepy can be installed in a few ways.### Pypi```bashpip3 install chepy# optionally with extra requirementspip3 install chepy[extras]```### Git```bashgit clone --recursive https://github.com/securisec/chepy.gitcd chepypip3 install -e .# I use -e here so that if I update later with git pull, I dont have it install it again (unless dependencies have changed)```#### [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/securisec/chepy)```bashdocker run --rm -ti -v $PWD:/data securisec/chepy &quot;some string&quot; [somefile, &quot;another string&quot;]```#### Standalone binaryOne can build Chepy to be a standalone binary also. This includes packaging all the dependencies together.```bashgit clone https://github.com/securisec/chepy.gitcd chepypip install .pip install pyinstallerpyinstaller cli.py --name chepy --onefile```The binary will be in the dist/ folder. ### Plugins[Check here for plugins docs](https://chepy-plugins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)### Used by[Remnux linux](https://docs.remnux.org/discover-the-tools/examine+static+properties/deobfuscation#chepy)```eval_rst.. toctree::   :maxdepth: 3   :caption: Contents:   usage.md   examples.md   cli.rst   chepy.md   core.md   modules.rst   extras.rst   plugins.md   pullrequest.md   config.md   faq.mdIndices and tables==================* :ref:`genindex`* :ref:`modindex`* :ref:`search````</longdescription>
