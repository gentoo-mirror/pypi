	<longdescription># duckdownDuckdown is a [tornado](https://tornadoweb.org) application.It uses python-markdown to convert pages to html dynamically and thenpresents those pages though tornado templates. This provides an easy syntax for users toedit their content and developers the ability to style the presentation.The templates, static files and pages can be hosted on Amazon S3. Thepublished site is static and can make use of CDN resources.  Thecost of hosting a site in this way would Â¢ ranther than $ per month.In order to make the site secure you would still need to host the sitein Route53 and provide Amazon hosted certificate and we're writing atool to automate that. The editing service can be provided by herokuon a hobby server - the one I'm looking at now uses 38mb of the memory and idles at 0 load!## Tools:Duckdown installed is an invoke tool that you call from the command line.```% duckdown -lSubcommands:  create    create a duckdown app at path  publish   generate public site  run       run app```### create```% duckdown create site```This will create a folder in the current directory called site whichcontains three folders: templates, static, pages.- tempates: contains the site_tmpl.html used to render markdown pages- static: contains resouces used by templates- pages: contains markdown pages stating with index.md### To use ###```python3 -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activatepip install duckdownduckdown create siteduckdown run site```You view the site on: http://localhost:8080You can edit the site at http://localhost:8080/editthe defaut username/password:```username: adminpassword: admin```---### Dev ###```python3 -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activatepip install -r dev-requirements.txtinv server```Now using: https://prismjs.com</longdescription>
