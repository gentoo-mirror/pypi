For particle dynamics simulation using finite difference scheme relativistic.## Table of content -   [Getting Started](#getting-started)    -   [Local build and launch](#local-build-and-launch)    -   [Documentation](#documentation)        -   [Adding a new section](#adding-a-new-section)    -   [Additional resources](#additional-resources)-   [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)    -   [Latex](#latex)-   [Useful Resources](#useful-resources)    -   [IDE](#ide)-   [Authors](#authors)-   [Licence](#license)-   [Contributing](#contributing)    -   [Dependencies](#dependencies)    -   [Formatting](#formatting)    -   [Tests](#tests)    -   [Maintaining](#maintaining)## Getting Started### Local build and launchTo build our application and create a Docker image, it will be enough to run the following command:`docker build -t redpic .`To launch the application, use the command:`docker run -it redpic`### DocumentationThe documentation contains all the Latex files needed to generate documentation. The main source files are located in the `manual`.* [main.tex](/manual/main.tex) is documentation source file. The final PDF can be found [here](https://github.com/fuodorov/redpic/releases/latest).[main.tex](/manual/main.tex) is the source file that Latex compiler will use to generate the paper. However, in order to keep the code cleaner, the main sections of the paper are all located in the [sections](/manual/sections). In this way you will experience less merging issues when two or more people are working on the same doc.Just edit the text in the relative Latex file (e.g., introduction, methodology, etc.) and you should be ready to go. No need to change any other file.#### Adding a new sectionJust copy a section file (e.g., [introduction.tex](/manual/sections/introduction.tex)) paste it in the same directory. Rename the pasted file (e.g. first_chapter.tex) and add this file to [main.tex](/manual/main.tex).### Additional ResourcesAlternatively you can find great resources on the [Overleaf Tutorial website](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials) or on [Latex wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX).## Prerequisites#### LatexLatex IDE and compiler installed locally on your machine. We recommend using a PyCharm plugin called [TeXiFy IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9473-texify-idea) as IDE and [miktex](https://miktex.org) as Latex compiler  Alternatively you can push your code to Overleaf using git and only use Overleaf. We would discourage you from doing this! Overleaf should only be used for the review.## Useful Resources### IDEYou may want to take advantage of the power of IDEs. For Python We would recommend using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). Alternatives are:* [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com)* [Atom](https://atom.io/)### GitYou should install [git](https://git-scm.com) on your computer. And have [GitHub](https://github.com) account.## Authors* **[Vyacheslav Fedorov](https://github.com/fuodorov)** - *Initial work** **[Danila Nikiforov](https://github.com/Danila-Nikiforov)** - *Initial work*## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details## Contributing### DependenciesUse `make deps` command to install library, its production and development dependencies.### FormattingUse `make format` to autoformat code with black tool. ### LinterUse `make lint` to run only linters for current python version### TestUse `make test` to run test for current python version### MaintainingIf pull request consists of several meaningful commits, that should be preserved, then use &quot;Rebase and merge&quot; option. Otherwise use &quot;Squash and merge&quot;. New release (changelog, tag and pypi upload) will be automatically created on each push to master via Github Actions workflow.</longdescription>
