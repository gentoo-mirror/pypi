	<longdescription># Polyswarm Customer CLIA CLI tool for interacting with the PolySwarm Customer APIs.Supports Python 2.7 and greater.## InstallationFrom PyPI:    pip install polyswarmFrom source:    python setup.py installIf you want yara validation (optional):    pip install -e .[yara]&gt; If you get an error about a missing package named `wheel`, that means your version of pip or setuptools is too old.&gt; You need pip &gt;= 19.0 and setuptools &gt;= 40.8.0. &gt; To update pip, run `pip install -U pip`.&gt; To update setuptools, run `pip install -U setuptools`## Usage### Command line clientSee the [Polyswarm Customer CLI documentation](https://docs.polyswarm.io/consumers/polyswarm-customer-cli-v2) for usage guidance.### Using as a packageThe `polyswarm-cli` package is built on top of the `polyswarm-api` package, and it includesa set of higher-level methods that facilitates the usage of parallelism when making requests to the api. We provide a class `Polyswarm` that extends from `PolyswarmAPI` and includes these methods. For example:```pythonfrom polyswarm.polyswarm import Polyswarmapi = Polyswarm('my-api-key')results = api.search_hashes(['e182cdfd5e7463d11f5e7bc49b4377ab25e58b9ff04266df3c34e6261c7b0df9',                             'd80a1e42791d17cbce8d053afccd1dae7fb9f615676cb81a3a1699e86c344cb8',                             '275a021bbfb6489e54d471899f7db9d1663fc695ec2fe2a2c4538aabf651fd0f'])for result in results:    print(result.id)```Each hash lookup is done in a different thread using a `ThreadPoolExecutor` and results are yieldedas they come in in the same order as in the input. All functionality that is available in the commandline tool is also available for developers through this class.## Automated TestsTo run automated tests suite (unit and integration):    pip install -r requirements.txt    pytestTo check current coverage by tests:    pytest --cov=polyswarm tests/## Questions?
