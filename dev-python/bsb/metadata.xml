Please check the**_Known Issues_** section at the bottom for important issues that fell victim to ourdeadlines and will be solved at a later date.# BSB: A scaffold modelling frameworkThis package is intended to facilitate spatially, topologically and morphologicallydetailed simulations of brain regions developed by the Department of Brain andBehavioral Sciences at the University of Pavia.## Installation### pipThis software can be installed as a Python package from PyPI through pip:```pip install bsb```### DevelopersDevelopers best use pip's *editable* install. This creates a live link between theinstalled package and the local git repository:``` git clone git@github.com:dbbs-lab/bsb cd bsb pip install -e .[dev] pre-commit install```## UsageThe scaffold framework can be used through the command line interface or as a python package.### Command line interface (CLI)Run the framework in the command line with subcommand `compile` to compile a networkarchitecture.```bsb --config=mouse_cerebellum_cortex_noTouch.json compile -x=200 -z=200 -p```To run with different configurations, change the config argument to the relative path of a.json config file. The `-p` flag indicates that the compiled network should be plottedafterwards and can be omitted.### Python packageThe central object is the `bsb.core.Scaffold` class. This object requires a`bsb.config.ScaffoldConfig` instance for its construction. To emulate the CLIfunctionality you can use the `JSONConfig` class and provide the relative path to theconfiguration file.```pythonfrom bsb import Scaffoldfrom bsb.config import JSONConfigconfig = new JSONConfig(file='mouse_cerebellum_cortex_noTouch.json')scaffoldInstance = new Scaffold(config)```This scaffold instance can then be used to perform the subcommands available in the CLI bycalling their corresponding functions:```pythonscaffoldInstance.compile_network()```#### Plotting network architectureAfter calling `compile_network` the scaffold instance can be plotted:```pythonscaffoldInstance.plot_network_cache()```# ContributingAll contributions are very much welcome.Take a look at the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)# Known issues## No configuration serializationWhen modifying the config object through scripts and then saving it to file, you'll storethe original configuration file text, and you won't actually serialize the modified objectWe will fix this by version 4.0## If MPI is installed but mpi4py is not undefined behavior may occurThe amount of NEST virtual processes is determined by using mpi4py to get the amount ofMPI processes. But if the package is not installed it is assumed no MPI simulations willbe ran and the amount of virtual processes might be lower than expected when used incombination with OpenMP. Be sure to `pip install` using the `[MPI]` requirement tag.</longdescription>
