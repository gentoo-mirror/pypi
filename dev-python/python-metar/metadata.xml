	<longdescription>Metar is a python package for interpreting METAR and SPECI weather reports.METAR is an international format for reporting weather observations.The standard specification for the METAR and SPECI codes is givenin the WMO Manual on Codes, vol I.1, Part A (WMO-306 I.i.A).  USconventions for METAR/SPECI reports are described in chapter 12 ofthe Federal Meteorological Handbook No.1. (FMH-1 1995), issued byNOAA.  See http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/wdc/metar/This module extracts the data recorded in the main-body groups ofreports that follow the WMO spec or the US conventions, except forthe runway state and trend groups, which are parsed but ignored.The most useful remark groups defined in the US spec are parsed,as well, such as the cumulative precipitation, min/max temperature,peak wind and sea-level pressure groups.  No other regional conventionsare formally supported, but a large number of variant formats foundin international reports are accepted.</longdescription>
