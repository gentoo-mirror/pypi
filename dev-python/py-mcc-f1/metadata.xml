	<longdescription># MCC-F1 Python packageRecently, the MCC-F1 curve has been proposed as an alternative, better way of assessing the performance of score-based binary classifiers [1].This Python package implements a function to compute the MCC-F1 curve, namely `mcc_f1_curve`, similarly to the `precision_recall_curve` and `roc_curve` functions of [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn).## Installation```consolepip install py-mcc-f1```## Usage```pythonfrom mcc_f1 import mcc_f1_curve, plot_mcc_f1_curveimport numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltfrom sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancerfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split# Load data and train modelX, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33)clf = LogisticRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)# Calculate MCC-F1 metric# @TODO# Get predictions and MCC-F1 curve pointsy_score = clf.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]mcc, f1, thresholds = mcc_f1_curve(y_test, y_score)# Plot MCC-F1 curveplot_mcc_f1_curve(clf, X_test, y_test)```Please refer to the function's docstring for further comments and details.## Future enhancements- [x] Function to plot the MCC-F1 curve, (e.g., `plot_mcc_f1_curve`), similar to `sklearn/metrics/_plot/precision_recall_curve.py` and `sklearn/metrics/_plot/roc_curve.py`;- [ ] Function to compute the MCC-F1 metric, as defined in section 2.2 of the original paper.## ContributingIf you would like to contribute to this package, please follow the [common community guidelines](https://github.com/MarcDiethelm/contributing).Please, also keep in mind that the main goal of this project is to be of similar implementation and quality as scikit-learn. Pull requests should pass the existing unit-tests, and add new ones when necessary.To run the tests:```consolemake test```## LicenseThis package is distributed under the [MIT license](./LICENSE).## References1.
