Note that pyStackReguses the high quality (i.e. high accuracy) mode of TurboReg that uses cubic spline interpolation for transformation.Please note: The bilinear transformation cannot be propagated, as a combination of bilinear transformations does notgenerally result in a bilinear transformation. Therefore, stack registration/transform functions won't work withbilinear transformation when using &quot;previous&quot; image as reference image. You can either use another reference (&quot;first&quot; or &quot;mean&quot; for first or mean image, respectively), or try to register/transform each image of the stackseparately to its respective previous image (and use the already transformed previous image as reference for thenext image).## InstallationYou can install ``napari-pystackreg`` via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):    pip install napari-pystackregYou can also install ``napari-pystackreg`` via [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):    conda install -c conda-forge napari-pystackregOr install it via napari's plugin installer.    Plugins &gt; Install/Uninstall Plugins... &gt; Filter for &quot;napari-pystackreg&quot; &gt; InstallTo install latest development version:    pip install git+https://github.com/glichtner/napari-pystackreg.git## Usage### Open Plugin User InterfaceStart up napari, e.g. from the command line:    napariThen, load an image stack (e.g. via ``File &gt; Open Image...``) that you want to register. You can also use the examplestack provided by the pluging (``File &gt; Open Sample &gt; napari-pystackreg: PC12 moving example``).Then, select the ``napari-pystackreg`` plugin from the ``Plugins &gt; napari-pystackreg: pystackreg`` menu.![](https://github.com/glichtner/napari-pystackreg/raw/main/docs/ui-initial.png)### User Interface OptionsA variety of options are available to control the registration process:* `Image Stack`: The image layer that should be registered/transformed.* `Transformation`: The type of transformation that should be applied.  - `Translation`: translation  - `Rigid body`: translation + rotation  - `Scaled rotation`: translation + rotation + scaling  - `Affine`: translation + rotation + scaling + shearing  - `Bilinear`: non-linear transformation; does not preserve straight lines* `Reference frame:` The reference image for registration.  - `Previous frame`: Aligns each frame (image) to its previous frame in the stack  - `Mean (all frames)`: Aligns each frame (image) to the average of all images in the stack  - `Mean (first n frames)`: Aligns each frame (image) to the mean of the first n frames in the stack. n is a tuneable parameter.* `Moving-average stack before register`: Apply a moving average to the stack before registration. This can be useful to  reduce noise in the stack (if the signal-to-noise ratio is very low). The moving average is applied to the stack only  for determining the transformation matrices, but not for the actual transforming of the stack.* `Transformation matrix file`: Transformation matrices can be saved to or loaded from a file for permanent storage.### Reference frameThe reference frame is the frame to which the other frames are aligned. The default option is to use the`Previous frame`, which will register each frame to its respective previous frame in the stack. Alternatively, thereference frame can be set to the mean of all frames in the stack (`Mean (all frames)`) or the mean of the first nframes in the stack (`Mean (first n frames)`). The latter option can be useful if the first frames in the stack are morestable than the later frames (e.g. if the first frames are taken before the sample is moved). When selecting the`Mean (first n frames)` option, the number of frames to use for the mean can be set via the spinbox below the option.![](https://github.com/glichtner/napari-pystackreg/raw/main/docs/ui-reference-mean-n.png)### Moving average before registrationTo increase registration performance with low signal-to-noise ratio stacks, a moving average can be applied to thestack before registration. The moving average is applied to the stack only for determining thetransformation matrices, but not for the actual transforming of the stack. That means that the transformed stack willstill contain the original frames (however registered), but not the averaged frames.When selecting the `Moving-average stack before register` option, the number of frames to use for the moving average canbe set via the spinbox below the option.![](https://github.com/glichtner/napari-pystackreg/raw/main/docs/ui-moving-average.png)### Transformation matrix fileThe transformation matrices can be saved to or loaded from a file for permanent storage. This can be useful if you wantto apply the same transformation to another stack (e.g. a different channel of the same sample). The transformationmatrices are saved as a numpy array in a binary file (``.npy``). The file can be loaded via the `Load` button and savedvia the `Save` button.![](https://github.com/glichtner/napari-pystackreg/raw/main/docs/ui-register-tmat.png)### Register/TransformTo perform the actual registration and transformation steps, click the `Register` and `Transform` buttons, respectively.The `Register` button will register the stack to the reference by determining the appropriate transformation matrices,without actually transforming the stack. The transformation matrices can be saved to a file via the `Save` button in the`Transformation matrix file` section.![](https://github.com/glichtner/napari-pystackreg/raw/main/docs/ui-registered.png)The `Transform` button (1) will transform the stack to the reference by applying the transformation matrices that arecurrently loaded to the stack selected in `Image Stack`. For the button to become active, either the transformationmatrices have to be loaded from a file via the `Load` button in the `Transformation matrix file` section, or the`Register` button has to be clicked first to determine the transformation matrices.The `Transform` button will also add a new image layer to the napari viewer (2) with the transformed stack. The name of thenew layer will be the name of the original stack with the prefix `Registered`.![](https://github.com/glichtner/napari-pystackreg/raw/main/docs/ui-transformed.png)Finally, the `Register &amp; Transform` button will perform both the registration and transformation steps in one go.----------------------------------## ContributingContributions are very welcome.
