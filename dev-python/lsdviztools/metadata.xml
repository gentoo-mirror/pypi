Getting started---------------You can install lsdviztools with pip.You can also use our docker container (in the second command you need to change the path after -v to your local directory). You first need to install docker: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop::  $ docker pull lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pytools_docker  $ docker run -it -v /path/to/my/local/directory:/LSDTopoTools -p 8888:8888 lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pytools_docker  # jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --no-browser --allow-rootThen go to the jupyter notebook in your web browser by going to http://localhost:8888/Credits-------This package was written by Simon M. Mudd, Fiona J. Clubb and Stuart W.D. GrieveThis package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template... _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage=======History=======0.1.0 (2020-05-01)------------------* First release on PyPI.0.2.0 (2020-06-16)------------------* Minor bug fixes0.3.0 (2020-09-03)------------------* Minor bug fixes0.4.0 (2021-02-03)------------------* Updated opentopography API and fixed chi mapping interface0.4.4 (2021-03-02)------------------* Fixed a bug in the projection section of gdalio. Trying to make the code more resistent to errors generate by different versions of proj0.4.5 (2021-07-22)------------------This release of lsdviztools adds some command line scripts for plotting basic rasters, chi analysis and concavity analysis.It also adds functionality for using the opentopography API, including downloading of data using the API key, so it includes, for example, the copernicus DEMs.It also fixes a bug with gdal that made up a pull request.0.4.6 (2021-07-23)------------------Minor update that includes changes to make sure scripts run.The four scripts are* lsdtt_plotbasicmetrics for basic plotting* lsdtt_plotchianalysis for channel profile analysis and tectonic geomorphology* lsdtt_plotconcavityanalysis for concavity analysis of river profiles* lsdtt_grabopentopographydata for grabbing data from opentopography.org0.4.7 (2021-08-27)------------------Some fixes* For scripts a fix to make sure you have the correct directory without the -dir flag* A fix to the opentopography api key* An update to the opentopography scraper that allows lower lef and upper right corners to be easily copied from google maps0.4.8 (2022-09-15)------------------Some fixes* More fixes to the opentopography grabber* This uses an api key in a file now0.4.9 (2022-12-13)------------------Some fixes* Added the lsdtt-valley-metrics to the driver interface* Added point mapping to the plotting tools* A number of bug fixes to the command line interface0.4.10 (2023-03-10)-------------------Some fixes* Added the descartes dependency* Small change to the swath plotting routine0.4.11 (2023-03-27)-------------------Important fix* Removed descartes dependency and switched this to a direct plotting routine. This fixes an error caused by transition to python 3.9 in google colab</longdescription>
