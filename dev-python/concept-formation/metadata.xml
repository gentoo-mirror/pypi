Overview========In this library, the `COBWEB&lt;http://axon.cs.byu.edu/~martinez/classes/678/Papers/Fisher_Cobweb.pdf&gt;`_ and`COBWEB/3&lt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.97.4676&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&gt;`_algorithms are implemented. These systems accept a stream of instances, whichare represented as dictionaries of attributes and values (where values can benominal for COBWEB and either numeric or nominal for COBWEB/3), and learns aconcept hierarchy. The resulting hierarchy can be used for clustering andprediction.This library also includes`TRESTLE &lt;http://christopia.net/data/articles/publications/maclellan-trestle-2016.pdf&gt;`_,an extension of COBWEB and COBWEB/3 that support structured and relational dataobjects. This system employs partial matching to rename new objects to alignwith previous examples, then categorizes these renamed objects.Lastly, we have extended the COBWEB/3 algorithm to support three keyimprovements. First, COBWEB/3 now uses an `unbiased estimator&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbiased_estimation_of_standard_deviation&gt;`_ tocalculate the standard deviation of numeric values. This is particularly usefulin situations where the number of available data points is low. Second,COBWEB/3 supports online normalization of the continuous values, which isuseful in situations where numeric values are on different scales and helps toensure that numeric values do not impact the model more than nominal values.Finally, it is assumed that there is some base noise in measuring continuousvalues, this noise insures that the probability of any one value never exceeds1, even when the standard deviation is small. Installation============You can install this software using pip::    pip install -U concept_formationYou can install the latest version of the code directly from github::        pip install -U git+https://github.com/cmaclell/concept_formation@masterImportant Links===============- Source code: `&lt;https://github.com/cmaclell/concept_formation&gt;`_- Documentation: `&lt;http://concept-formation.readthedocs.org&gt;`_Examples========We have created a number of examples to demonstrate the basic functionality ofthis library. The examples can be found `here &lt;http://concept-formation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html&gt;`_.  Citing this Software ====================If you use this software in a scientific publiction, then we would appreciatecitation of the following paper:MacLellan, C.J., Harpstead, E., Aleven, V., Koedinger K.R.
