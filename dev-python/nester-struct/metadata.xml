And some languages, such as GoLang, have their own CLI utilites to set everything up where it belongs.&lt;br&gt;Let me tell you though, who cares?## Our GoalOur goal with **Nester** is to provide developers a quick and easy way to set up and manage new projects adhearing to the given language's standard giving you more time to actually build your application without having to deal with mkdir-hell.One simple cli-Command and Nester will do the rest for you, optionally even initializing a new git-repository for you.Nester, by default, also logs all projects you create with it which allows you to easily view and clean up your projects and avoid creating duplicate projects. Never loose your overview over your projects again!## Installation### Get it on PyPi!`Nester` is released on [PyPi](https://pypi.org)!&lt;br&gt;To do so, make sure you have at least `Python 3.10` and `pip` installed.&lt;br&gt;To get `Nester` simply run:```bashpip install nester-struct```Your done! Have fun with `Nester`!### Get it as an `.rpm` package (wip)We can now offer a `.rpm` package!To do so follow these steps (on openSUSE):1. Add the repository```bashsudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:kodymo/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/home:kodymo.repo```2. Refresh your repositories```bashsudo zypper ref```3. Install Nester```bashsudo zypper install python3-nester```Note: The repository contains three builds for nester for Python 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11. `zypper` will automatically decide which version to use when running the command above.You can visit the repository on the [package maintainer's OBS account](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:kodymo/python-nester).### Build it from sourceIf you want to contribute to `Nester` or just prefer building it yoursef, refer to the [Contributing Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) to find out how.## Usage**Nester** strives to be easy to use and will have to modes of operation:### CLI ModeThis mode will be the default and how **Nester** is supposed to be used.&lt;br&gt;Simply call `nester`, hand it the operation and the language you want and whether you want to initialize a git repository alongside it. Done!```nester &lt;OPERATION&gt; &lt;OPTIONAL FLAGS&gt; &lt;LANGUAGE&gt; &lt;PROJECT_NAME&gt;```The following operations will be available:|`Operation`|Flags|Argument|Argument|Effect||-|-|-|-|-||`create`|`-g/--git`, `--no-log`|`Language`|`Project_Name`|Creates the project structure for the selected lanugage in *the current directory*. IF `-git` is set it will also call `git init` in this directory. `--no-log` Will prevent Nester from creating a log entry for this project. You can find the log in your home directory at `~/nester.log`||`validate`|n/A|`Language`|`Project_Name`|Checks the current directory and its sub-directories if it corresponds to the schema provided for the language||`log`|`--clean`|n/A|n/A|Prints out all *logged* projects that have been created previously&lt;br&gt;If the `--clean` flag is set, orphaned log entries (projects which had their directory deleted) will be purged from the log||`clean`|`-y/--yes`|`Project_Name`|n/A|Deletes the content of the specified project|### Interactive / GUI - ModeThis is considered to be the fallback mode. If **Nester** is called without any arguments you will be asked to enter all parameters manually.The parameters themselves will stay the same though.```nester```### Supported LanguagesCurrently planned support for the following languages is planned.|Language|Parameter|Supported yet?||-|-|-||Python|`py`|:heavy_check_mark:||C|`c`|:heavy_check_mark:||C++|`cpp`|:heavy_check_mark:||C#|`cs`|:heavy_check_mark:||Ruby|`rb`|:heavy_check_mark:||Java|`java`|:heavy_check_mark:|*Note:* Python will be set up with the `src-Layout` which currently seems to be the standard for Python projects and was the stone that started it all.For the future we are also looking into supporting languages with built-in set up features simply by calling them aswell as other languages with standardized structure layouts, but for now this list is all which will be supported.## DocumentationGood documentation is very important to us, even with such a small project like Nester. To this end we have two methods in place to build documentation for us:#### Read the DocsOn our [Read the Docs](https://nester.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) we build the documentation for the project. You can find the installation and usage guides there, aswell as an overview over the languages we support or want to support.Also there is the automatically build documentation of functions and modules that make Nester go.#### Towncrier (wip)Towncrier is used to build changelogs for us. It is required that Pull Requests, which change Nesters behaviour, include a changelog file.## ContributingWe are happy to welcome you to the group of Nester contributors. Please check the [Contributing Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) to find out how you can help achieve our goal.If you are curious on what we next need help with, [check the issues page](https://github.com/ByteOtter/nester/issues).![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/ByteOtter/nester)![GitHub milestone](https://img.shields.io/github/milestones/progress/ByteOtter/nester/3)</longdescription>
