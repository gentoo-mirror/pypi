	<longdescription># Almoststatic**Almoststatic** is a static sites and web pages generator engine written in[Python](https://python.org) which uses the[Jinja2 template system](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) to render pages.It can be integrated with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) apps toserve static contents on dynamic sites or used only for static sites development.Pages are declared in [yaml](https://yaml.org/) files and rendered with Jinja2template files, the html contents can be written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)markup language or in plain html. &quot;content&quot; folder contains all data needed todo the job, the &quot;config.yaml&quot; is used to share global parameters and to setupconfiguration.It is roughly inspired by [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator,but it differs in many ways.# Why Almoststatic?There are many static site generators such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but you canprefer Almostatic because:- **It's perfect for pythonist.** It uses Jinja2 and Flask which are widely  used by python community, so you don\'t need to learn other programming  languages or template engines.- **It's easy!** In fact the rules are very few and this mean few things to  learn and great flexibility.- **It's versatile.** It's engine has a powerful recursive system for embedding  and including contents. This helps you to build rich contents and also to  split them in small pieces called *&quot;widgets&quot;* easier to maintain.- **It has blog capabilities.** Contain functions used to query metadata info  useful to organize blog pages by categories and tags.- **You can deliver static and dynamic contents at same time.** With Flask you  can build your dynamic content and let Almoststatic to render the rest of  page or the whole page, if it is full static.- **Write static sites.** Static sites are composed only by text files and media  contents. They are easy to deliver on the web, are secure by design, require  less maintenance and resources and are faster. If you have no need for dynamic  contents, with **Almoststatic** you can write all pages as static.- **Not only for pythonists.** Basic knowledge of python is needed, but once  your developer environment is ready, Almoststatic lets you to focus on  writing yaml and karkdown\'s contents and to create your own widgets in html  and Jinja2.# Quick startThe simplest way to see if **Almoststatic** is what you're looking for, is totry the sample provided with source code package and explore the source code.The following tutorial is tested on Linux Ubuntu, but it's easy to port onother platforms such other Linux distros, Windows or Mac.You need git and python3, install them with:```bash$ sudo apt install git python3```Last linux's releases comes with python3 already installed and you have only tocheck if your version is 3.6 or higher:```bash$ python3 --version```Now clone Almoststatic with git and enter into the directory:```bash$ git clone https://gitlab.com/claudio.driussi/almoststatic.git$ cd almoststatic```It's common in python using virtualenv for development, to do so and to installAlmoststatic, write:```bash$ python3 -m venv myvenv$ source myvenv/bin/activate$ pip install almoststatic$ pip install pyftpsync```Done! Now you can try the sample, cd into sample directory and run flaskapp.py:```bash$ cd sample/$ python flaskapp.py```A local host Flask App instance server is executed and you can testAlmoststatic features.Open your browser and copy and paste the following URL: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`or `localhost:5000`You will be redirected to the static site showing some widgets and featureof Almostatic, you can navigate to see some examples.You can always exit from server pressing CTRL-C on your terminal.To build static site run:```bash$ python write_static.py$ ls -l ../_static_site/```As you can see, your pages are written as *.html files, but this is not enoughto get a really static site, to do this you have to tune writing parameters andcopy media files on appropriate location. When you are done the site can bepublished as static site.If you wish, you can run tests:```bash$ cd ../test$ python as_test.py```This do some tests and write a simpler static site.Now if you decide that **Almoststatic** is right for you, you can dig intosource code of sample and tests and read the documentation at:[https://almoststatic.readthedocs.io](https://almoststatic.readthedocs.io)# Status of projectAlmoststatic is young but stable! It has all planed features and always gave methe right results.At the moment there are only one theme which is ready for production, anyway itis a developing theme. You can see a demo on[http://flatstep.claudiodriussi.it/](http://flatstep.claudiodriussi.it/)and download source from [Flatstep theme repository](https://gitlab.com/almoststatic-themes/flatstep)I'm not a designer so the result is of average quality. But I'm sure that gooddesigners can write great themes.# DonateIf you appreciate Almoststatic, you can make a donation via PayPal[![paypal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=JYJ6EMFY7YWJQ)</longdescription>
