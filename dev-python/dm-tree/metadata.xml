	<longdescription># Tree`tree` is a library for working with nested data structures. In a way, `tree`generalizes the builtin `map` function which only supports flat sequences,and allows to apply a function to each &quot;leaf&quot; preserving the overallstructure.```python&gt;&gt;&gt; import tree&gt;&gt;&gt; structure = [[1], [[[2, 3]]], [4]]&gt;&gt;&gt; tree.flatten(structure)[1, 2, 3, 4]&gt;&gt;&gt; tree.map_structure(lambda v: v**2, structure)[[1], [[[4, 9]]], [16]]````tree` is backed by an optimized C++ implementation suitable for use indemanding applications, such as machine learning models.## InstallationFrom PyPI:```shell$ pip install dm-tree```Directly from github using pip:```shell$ pip install git+git://github.com/deepmind/tree.git```Build from source:```shell$ python setup.py install```## SupportIf you are having issues, please let us know by filing an issue on our[issue tracker](https://github.com/deepmind/tree/issues).## LicenseThe project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.</longdescription>
