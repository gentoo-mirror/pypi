It does so whenan application is fullscreened (eg: youtube), or when you click on the systrayicon (which you can do, when, eg: reading).History-------Caffeing-ng (since 2014) started as a fork of `Caffeine 2.4`_, since theoriginal version dropped support for the systray icon in favour of onlyautomatic detection of fullscreen apps only, which turned to be a rather`controversial`_ decision.The intention of this fork is to also evolve on its own, not only fixingissues, but also implemented missing features, when relevant.Caffeine-ng was shortly know as Taurine, a play on its successor's name, sincetaurine is a known stimulant, commonly found in energy drinks.  However, thisname did not last, since the artwork would not match adequately, and changingit was undesirable... _Caffeine 2.4: http://launchpad.net/caffeine/.. _controversial: https://bugs.launchpad.net/caffeine/+bug/1321750System requirements-------------------* Python 3.6 to 3.9 is required.* ``caffeine-ng`` works with the following screensavers / screenlockers:  * Anything that implements the ``org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver`` API (this    includes KDE, amongst others)  * gnome-screensaver  * XSS  * Xorg + DPMS  * xautolock  * xidlehook.See ``setup.py`` for required python packagesInstallation------------Generic installation....................To manually install caffeine-ng, run::      python setup.py build      sudo python setup.py install      sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemasDebian and derivatives......................First install all the required packages::      apt install python-click python-ewmh python-setproctitle python-wheel python-xdgAnd mark them auto if you wish::      apt-mark auto python-click python-ewmh python-setproctitle python-wheel python-xdgThen you need to build sources with::      make clean      make buildCreate a package for your distribution::      checkinstall --pkgname=caffeine-ng --pkgversion=3.4 --requires=&quot;python-click \(\&gt;=0.6.2\),python-ewmh \(\&gt;=0.1.4\),python-setproctitle \(\&gt;=1.1.10\),python-wheel \(\&gt;=0.29.0\),python-xdg \(\&gt;=0.25\)&quot; --conflicts=&quot;caffeine&quot; --nodoc python ./setup.py install --install-layout=debReplace version string with correct version and append this command with``--install=no`` should you wish to inspect created package before installingit Replace ``python`` with ``python3`` in package names above if you wish tobuild caffeine-ng with python 3Replace ``python`` with ``python3`` in ``checkinstall`` invocation to usespecific python version to build caffeine-ng.``checkinstall`` is available for various distributions, so you may followthese steps adapting them to your distributionArchLinux.........On ArchLinux, caffeine-ng is available at the `AUR`_... _AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/caffeine-ng/Gentoo......Gentoo users may find `caffeine-ng &lt;https://github.com/PF4Public/gentoo-overlay/tree/master/x11-misc/caffeine-ng&gt;`_ in `::pf4public &lt;https://github.com/PF4Public/gentoo-overlay&gt;`_ Gentoo overlayInstructions for packager-------------------------Generating a Python wheel for this will produce bogus results. Python wheels donow allow for files outside python's site-packages (and things in /bin).The Python ecosystem is deprecating the usage of `pip` and `setuptools` asgeneric packaging tools. This project will likely migrate to `meson` in future,which should ease shipping all the non-Python bits of it (desktop entry, icon,translations, service files, etc).Auto-start----------To have Caffeine-ng run on startup, add it to your System Settings =&gt; StartupPrograms list.License-------Copyright (C) 2009 The Caffeine DevelopersCopyright (C) 2014-2022 Hugo Osvaldo Barrera &lt;hugo@barrera.io&gt;Caffeine-ng is distributed under the GNU General Public License, either version3, or (at your option) any later version.

You will need to a language packfor the specific language) Be aware that some stock itemswill not be translated unless you log in with a given language.</longdescription>
