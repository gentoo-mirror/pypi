	<longdescription>.. note that this README gets 'include'ed into the main documentationsphinxcontrib-trio==================This sphinx extension helps you document Python code that usesasync/await, or abstract methods, or context managers, or generators,or ... you get the idea. It works by making sphinx's regulardirectives for documenting Python functions and methods smarter andmore powerful. The name is because it was originally written for the`Trio &lt;https://trio.readthedocs.io&gt;`__ project, and I'm not verycreative. But don't be put off â€“ there's nothing Trio- orasync-specific about this extension; any Python project canbenefit. (Though projects using async/await probably benefit the most,since sphinx's built-in tools are especially inadequate in this case.)Vital statistics----------------**Requirements:** This extension currently assumes you're using Python3.5+ to build your docs. This could be relaxed if anyone wants to senda patch.**Documentation:** https://sphinxcontrib-trio.readthedocs.io**Bug tracker and source code:**https://github.com/python-trio/sphinxcontrib-trio**License:** MIT or Apache 2, your choice.**Usage:** ``pip install -U sphinxcontrib-trio`` in the sameenvironment where you installed sphinx, and then add``&quot;sphinxcontrib_trio&quot;`` to the list of ``extensions`` in yourproject's ``conf.py``. (Notice that ``&quot;sphinxcontrib_trio&quot;`` has anunderscore in it, NOT a dot. This is because I don't understandnamespace packages, and I fear things that I don't understand.)**Code of conduct:** Contributors are requested to follow our `code ofconduct&lt;https://github.com/python-trio/sphinxcontrib-trio/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md&gt;`__in all project spaces.</longdescription>
