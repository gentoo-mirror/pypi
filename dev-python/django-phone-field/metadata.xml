	<longdescription># django-phone-fieldLightweight model and form field for phone numbers in Django* View and edit phone numbers in forms and the Django admin in pretty format: `(415) 123-4567`* Store all phone numbers canonically in the database for easy searching &amp; uniqueness: `+14151234567`* Built-in support for simple extensions: `(415) 123-4567, press 88`* Doesn't choke on international numbers (but doesn't format them, either)* Automatically format phone numbers in templatesThis package is simple, lightweight, and without dependencies. However, it doesn't attempt to solve fancyproblems or deal with international phone numbers. For a full-featured phone number package, take a look at[`django-phonenumber-field`](https://github.com/stefanfoulis/django-phonenumber-field).## InstallationThis package is designed for Python 3 and Django 1.10+. Install via:```pip install django-phone-field```Then add `'phone_field'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.## UsageIn your `models.py`:```from django.db import modelsfrom phone_field import PhoneFieldclass MyModel(models.Model):    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)    phone = PhoneField(blank=True, help_text='Contact phone number')````PhoneField` accepts standard options for a Django `CharField`. By default it sets `max_length=31`. Feelfree to override this, set `blank=True`, etc. as you would otherwise.There is one special argument, `E164_only=False`, which adds a form validator to only accept numbers inthe E164 format (currently, only supported for US phone numbers).In your template:```User {{ obj.name }} has phone number {{ obj.phone }}```Result:```User Ted has phone number (415) 123-1233```## Database representation`PhoneField` attempts to coerce all phone numbers to the following format:```+[country code][number]x[extension]+12223334444x55```where the extension part is optional. If the input phone number can't be coerced to thisformat, `PhoneField` gives up and simply stores it as-is.Because all phone numbers are stored without formatting, you can set this field to be uniqueon a Django model and it will actually work.## ExtrasUse the `|phone` template filter to attempt to display a formatted phone number from arbitrary text. Usethe `|raw_phone` template filter to display the raw, un-formatted value.Use property `.is_E164` to check if a PhoneNumber object is in E164 format.Also provided are `.is_standard` (E164 but with extensions allowed) and `.is_usa`.</longdescription>
