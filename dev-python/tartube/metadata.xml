	<longdescription>Tartube is a GUI front-end for youtube-dl, yt-dlp and other compatible videodownloaders.It is written in Python 3 / Gtk 3 and runs on MS Windows, Linux, BSD and MacOS.- You can fetch a list of videos from your favourite channels and playlists onYouTube, BitChute, and hundreds of other websites- In buffering is an issue, you can download a temporary copy of a video beforeautomatically opening it in your favourite media player- Tartube will organise your videos into convenient folders (if that's what youwant)- Tartube can alert you when livestreams and debut videos are starting (YouTubeonly)- If creators upload their videos to more than one website (YouTube andBitChute, for example), Tartube can interact with both sites without creatingduplicates- Certain websites operate an &quot;only one opinion allowed&quot; policy. If you thinkthat the censors will remove a video, against the wishes of its creators andbefore you've had a chance to watch it, Tartube can make an archive copy- Certain websites manipulate search results, repeatedly unsubscribe peoplefrom their favourite channels and/or deliberately conceal videos that theydon't like. Tartube won't do any of those things- If you want to listen to your favourite discussion videos, for example whiledriving a car, Tartube can make an archive copy of just the audio, rather thanthe full video- Tartube is free and open-source softwareNote for PyPI users: Tartube should be installed with: pip3 install tartube</longdescription>
