	<longdescription>Inspired by the implementation of data modeling in [SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/zzzeek/sqlalchemy) lib - What the great Job! Thank You! -, i wrote this little wrapper around the [Azure Storage SDK for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-python) to simplify modeling data structures and easily implement Client Side Encryption for my own needs. Would be lucky if this lib helps other peoples too. GitHub Issues, Stars, Forks and Contribution are Welcome! Have fun with azurestoragewrap. Microsoft Azure Storage is a Microsoft-managed cloud service that provides storage that is highly available, secure, durable, scalable, and redundant. Azure Storage consists of Blob storage, Table Storage, and Queue storage.  All Data can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS.</longdescription>
