Forinstance, if you are using `asyncpg` version `0.25.0`, you would use `asyncpg-stubs`version `0.25.X` where `X` is the latest **patch** version of the stubs. Using semverdependencty specifications, `asyncpg-stubs` version `~0.25` is designed to work with`asyncpg` version `~0.25`.In addition, `asyncpg-stubs` will indicate which versions of the runtime library are compatible through its dependency information (as suggested in PEP-561).</longdescription>
