	<longdescription># The torque appThis is the django app that should be deployed in a running django server.Outside of installing the app, this should remain a black box.  The reason beingthat none of the routes or uses for this should be accessed exceptthrough the [Torque MediaWiki plugin](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Torque).For developers, look in the individual code files for details on the innerworkings.See [INSTALL.md](https://code.librehq.com/ots/mediawiki/torque/-/blob/main/django-torque/INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.# Django Commandstorque ships commands## remove_unattachedWhenever loading up a new collection, there may be changes to the form of the dataas the collection evolves.  Because it may be uploaded in mistake, nothing is deletedfrom the database to ensure that no unintentional data loss occurs.  However, adminsmay want to remove that data to reflect the upgrades in the data.`remove_unattached` removes those items.  Each field/document that gets uploaded willbe marked as `attached`.  If there are edits associated with a field or document, thenthe `--forced` argument is required.## Removing attachment filesAs a system runs, old FileField files can hang around on the hard drive.  Thoseare usually uploaded attachments and templates.  This can start to take uptoo much space.  To remove, one was is to use[https://github.com/akolpakov/django-unused-media](django-unused-media):```$ pipenv install django-unused-media```Add `'django_unused_media'` to your INSTALLED_APPS and then run:```$ pipenv run python ./manage.py cleanup_unused_media```</longdescription>
