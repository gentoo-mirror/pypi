	<longdescription># Solana Trader Python ClientProvides a Python SDK for bloXroute's Solana Trader API.## Installation```$ pip install bxsolana-trader```## UsageThis library supports HTTP, websockets, and GRPC interfaces. You can use it witha context manager or handle open/closing yourself.For any methods involving transaction creation you will need to provide your Solana private key. You can provide this via the environment variable `PRIVATE_KEY`, or specify it via the provider configuration if you want to load it with some other mechanism. See samples for more information. As a general note on this: methods named `post_*` (e.g. `post_order`) typically do not sign/submit the transaction, only return the raw unsigned transaction. This isn't very useful to most users (unless you want to write a signer in a different language), and you'll typically want the similarly named `submit_*` methods (e.g. `submit_order`). These methods generate, sign, and submit thetransaction all at once.You will also need your bloXroute authorization header to use these endpoints. By default, this is loaded from the `AUTH_HEADER` environment variable.Context manager:```pythonfrom bxsolana import providerasync with provider.http() as api:    print(await api.get_orderbook(market=&quot;ETHUSDT&quot;))    async with provider.ws() as api:    async for update in api.get_orderbooks_stream(market=&quot;ETHUSDT&quot;):        print(update)```Manual:```pythonimport bxsolanafrom bxsolana import providerp = provider.grpc()api = await bxsolana.trader_api(p)try:    await api.get_orderbook(market=&quot;ETHUSDT&quot;)finally:    await p.close()```Refer to the `examples/` for more info.## DevelopmentbloXroute Solana Trader API's interfaces are primarily powered by protobuf, so you will need to install it for your system: https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/In order to install local version of bxsolana_trader_proto dependencyyou can build the solana-trader-proto/python directory using these commands```    $ cd ~/solana-trader-proto/        upgrade the version in pyproject.toml           $ make proto-build-api-python    $ cd python        you can also push the package to pypi     $ rm -rf python/dist/    $ python3 -m build    $ python3 -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*        and install the package locally now    $ pip install dist/bxsolana-trader-proto-0.0.18.tar.gz        now you can update the depdendency in solana-trader-client-python    update the version of bxsolana-trader-proto in setup.cfg    and run     $ pip install -r requirements.txt    ```Clone project and install dependencies:```$ git clone https://github.com/bloXroute-Labs/solana-trader-client-python.git$ cd solana-trader-client-python$ pip install -r requirements.txt```Run tests:```$ make testLinting:```$ make lint```MIT LicenseCopyright (c) 2022 bloXroute LabsPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
