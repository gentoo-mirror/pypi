	<longdescription># coverage thresholdA command line tool for checking coverage reports against configurable coverage minimums.Currently built for use around python's [coverage](https://pypi.org/project/coverage/)### Installation`pip install coverage-threshold`also recommended:`pip install coverage`### UsageTypical execution:```bashcoverage run -m pytest tests/  # or any test runner herecoverage jsoncoverage-threshold```cli command options:```&gt; coverage-threshold --helpusage: coverage-threshold [-h] [--line-coverage-min LINE_COVERAGE_MIN]                          [--branch-coverage-min BRANCH_COVERAGE_MIN]                          [--combined-coverage-min COMBINED_COVERAGE_MIN]                          [--file-line-coverage-min FILE_LINE_COVERAGE_MIN]                          [--file-branch-coverage-min FILE_BRANCH_COVERAGE_MIN]                          [--file-combined-coverage-min FILE_COMBINED_COVERAGE_MIN]                          [--coverage-json COVERAGE_JSON] [--config CONFIG]A command line tool for checking coverage reports against configurable coverage minimumsoptional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  --line-coverage-min LINE_COVERAGE_MIN                        minimum global average line coverage threshold  --branch-coverage-min BRANCH_COVERAGE_MIN                        minimum global average branch coverage threshold  --combined-coverage-min COMBINED_COVERAGE_MIN                        minimum global average combined line and branch coverage threshold  --file-line-coverage-min FILE_LINE_COVERAGE_MIN                        the line coverage threshold for each file  --file-branch-coverage-min FILE_BRANCH_COVERAGE_MIN                        the branch coverage threshold for each file  --file-combined-coverage-min FILE_COMBINED_COVERAGE_MIN                        the combined line and branch coverage threshold for each file  --coverage-json COVERAGE_JSON                        path to coverage json (default: ./coverage.json)  --config CONFIG       path to config file (default: ./pyproject.toml)```### Configthe current expected config file format is [toml](https://toml.io/en/)the default config file used is `pyproject.toml` but and alternative path can be specified with `--config`example config:```toml[coverage-threshold]line_coverage_min = 95file_line_coverage_min = 95branch_coverage_min = 50    [coverage-threshold.modules.&quot;src/cli/&quot;]    file_line_coverage_min = 40    [coverage-threshold.modules.&quot;src/cli/my_command.py&quot;]    file_line_coverage_min = 100    [coverage-threshold.modules.&quot;src/lib/&quot;]    file_line_coverage_min = 100    file_branch_coverage_min = 100    [coverage-threshold.modules.&quot;src/model/&quot;]    file_line_coverage_min = 100    [coverage-threshold.modules.&quot;src/__main__.py&quot;]    file_line_coverage_min = 0```Each string key in `config.modules` is treated as a path prefix, where the longest matching prefix is used to configure the coverage thresholds for each file</longdescription>
