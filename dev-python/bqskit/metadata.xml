	<longdescription># Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit (BQSKit)The Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit (BQSKit) \[bis â€¢ kit\] is a powerful and portable quantum compiler framework.It can be used with ease to compile quantum programs to efficient physical circuits for any QPU.## InstallationBQSKit is available for Python 3.8+ on Linux, macOS, and Windows. BQSKitand its dependencies are listed on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org),and as such, pip can easily install it:```shpip install bqskit```An optional extension includes pre-built support for many quantum devices and modules for working with other quantum frameworks. Pip can install this extension by appending `[ext]` to the previous command:```shpip install 'bqskit[ext]'```**Note**: If you are using a device with Apple Silicon, you will need to install BQSKit with Anaconda. See the [instructions here](https://github.com/BQSKit/bqskit-tutorial/blob/master/README.md) for more information. We are currently in the process of implementing native ARM support. When that is ready, we will update this note.## Basic UsageA standard workflow utilizing BQSKit consists of loading a program into the framework, modeling the target QPU, compiling the program, and exporting the resulting circuit. The below example uses BQSKit to optimize an input circuit provided by a qasm file:```pythonfrom bqskit import compile, Circuit# Load a circuit from QASMcircuit = Circuit.from_file(&quot;input.qasm&quot;)# Compile the circuitcompiled_circuit = compile(circuit)# Save output as QASMcompiled_circuit.save(&quot;output.qasm&quot;)```To learn more about BQSKit, follow the [tutorial series](https://github.com/BQSKit/bqskit-tutorial/blob/master/1_comping_with_bqskit.ipynb) or refer to the [documentation](https://bqskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).## How to CiteYou can use the [software disclosure](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1785933) to cite the BQSKit package.Additionally, if you used or extended a specific algorithm, you can cite that individually. BQSKit passes will include a relevant reference in their documentation.## LicenseThe software in this repository is licensed under a **BSD free software license**and can be used in source or binary form for any purpose as long as the simplelicensing requirements are followed.
