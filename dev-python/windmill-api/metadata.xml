	<longdescription># Autogenerated Windmill OpenApi ClientThis is the raw autogenerated api client. You are most likely more interested in [wmill](https://pypi.org/project/wmill/) which leverages this client to offer an user friendly experience. We use [this openapi python client generator](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client/)# windmill-apiA client library for accessing Windmill API## UsageFirst, create a client:```pythonfrom windmill_api import Clientclient = Client(base_url=&quot;https://api.example.com&quot;)```If the endpoints you're going to hit require authentication, use `AuthenticatedClient` instead:```pythonfrom windmill_api import AuthenticatedClientclient = AuthenticatedClient(base_url=&quot;https://api.example.com&quot;, token=&quot;SuperSecretToken&quot;)```Now call your endpoint and use your models:```pythonfrom windmill_api.models import MyDataModelfrom windmill_api.api.my_tag import get_my_data_modelfrom windmill_api.types import Responsewith client as client:    my_data: MyDataModel = get_my_data_model.sync(client=client)    # or if you need more info (e.g. status_code)    response: Response[MyDataModel] = get_my_data_model.sync_detailed(client=client)```Or do the same thing with an async version:```pythonfrom windmill_api.models import MyDataModelfrom windmill_api.api.my_tag import get_my_data_modelfrom windmill_api.types import Responseasync with client as client:    my_data: MyDataModel = await get_my_data_model.asyncio(client=client)    response: Response[MyDataModel] = await get_my_data_model.asyncio_detailed(client=client)```By default, when you're calling an HTTPS API it will attempt to verify that SSL is working correctly. Using certificate verification is highly recommended most of the time, but sometimes you may need to authenticate to a server (especially an internal server) using a custom certificate bundle.```pythonclient = AuthenticatedClient(    base_url=&quot;https://internal_api.example.com&quot;,     token=&quot;SuperSecretToken&quot;,    verify_ssl=&quot;/path/to/certificate_bundle.pem&quot;,)```You can also disable certificate validation altogether, but beware that **this is a security risk**.```pythonclient = AuthenticatedClient(    base_url=&quot;https://internal_api.example.com&quot;,     token=&quot;SuperSecretToken&quot;,     verify_ssl=False)```Things to know:1. Every path/method combo becomes a Python module with four functions:    1. `sync`: Blocking request that returns parsed data (if successful) or `None`    1. `sync_detailed`: Blocking request that always returns a `Request`, optionally with `parsed` set if the request was successful.    1. `asyncio`: Like `sync` but async instead of blocking    1. `asyncio_detailed`: Like `sync_detailed` but async instead of blocking1. All path/query params, and bodies become method arguments.1. If your endpoint had any tags on it, the first tag will be used as a module name for the function (my_tag above)1. Any endpoint which did not have a tag will be in `windmill_api.api.default`## Advanced customizationsThere are more settings on the generated `Client` class which let you control more runtime behavior, check out the docstring on that class for more info. You can also customize the underlying `httpx.Client` or `httpx.AsyncClient` (depending on your use-case):```pythonfrom windmill_api import Clientdef log_request(request):    print(f&quot;Request event hook: {request.method} {request.url} - Waiting for response&quot;)def log_response(response):    request = response.request    print(f&quot;Response event hook: {request.method} {request.url} - Status {response.status_code}&quot;)client = Client(    base_url=&quot;https://api.example.com&quot;,    httpx_args={&quot;event_hooks&quot;: {&quot;request&quot;: [log_request], &quot;response&quot;: [log_response]}},)# Or get the underlying httpx client to modify directly with client.get_httpx_client() or client.get_async_httpx_client()```You can even set the httpx client directly, but beware that this will override any existing settings (e.g., base_url):```pythonimport httpxfrom windmill_api import Clientclient = Client(    base_url=&quot;https://api.example.com&quot;,)# Note that base_url needs to be re-set, as would any shared cookies, headers, etc.client.set_httpx_client(httpx.Client(base_url=&quot;https://api.example.com&quot;, proxies=&quot;http://localhost:8030&quot;))```</longdescription>
