Running the executable does not require a Python installation.You can find more details on the installation [here](https://jancbrammer.github.io/biopeaks/installation.html).# DocumentationHave a look at the [user guide](https://jancbrammer.github.io/biopeaks/user_guide.html) to get started with `biopeaks`.# Contributors welcome!Improvements or additions to the repository (documentation, tests, code) are welcome and encouraged.Spotted a typo in the documentation? Caught a bug in the code? Ideas for improving the documentation,increase test coverage, or adding features to the GUI? Get started with the [contributor guide](https://jancbrammer.github.io/biopeaks/contributor_guide.html).# CitationPlease refer to the [biopeaks paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02621) in The Journal of Open Source Software.# ChangelogHave a look at the [changelog](https://jancbrammer.github.io/biopeaks/changelog.html) to get an overview of what has changed throughout the versions of `biopeaks`.</longdescription>
