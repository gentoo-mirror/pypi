	<longdescription>[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/hyroai/computation-graph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/hyroai/computation-graph)A function composition framework that supports:1. State - functions which retain state for their next turn of action.2. Prioritized paths - lazily attempt overloaded composition paths according to priorities.3. Deep dependency injection - compose a function to a variadic function at the end of an arbitrarily long pipeline.4. Non cancerous `asyncio` support.`pip install computation-graph`To deploy: `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel; twine upload dist/*; rm -rf dist/;`### Type checkingThe runner will type check all outputs for nodes with return type annotations. In case of a wrong typing, it will log the node at fault.### Debugging#### Computation traceAvailable computation trace visualizers:1. `graphviz.computation_trace`1. `mermaid.computation_trace`1. `ascii.computation_trace`To use, replace `to_callable` with `run.to_callable_with_side_effect` with your selected style as the first argument.#### Graphviz debuggerThis debugger will save a file on each graph execution to current working directory.You can use this file in a graph viewer like [gephi](https://gephi.org/).Nodes colored red are part of the 'winning' computation path.Each of these nodes has the attributes 'result' and 'state'.'result' is the output of the node, and 'state' is the _new_ state of the node.In gephi you can filter for the nodes participating in calculation of final result by filtering on result != null.</longdescription>
