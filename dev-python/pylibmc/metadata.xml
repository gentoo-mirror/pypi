	<longdescription>`pylibmc` is a Python client for `memcached &lt;http://memcached.org/&gt;`_ written in C.See `the documentation at sendapatch.se/projects/pylibmc/`__ for more information.__ http://sendapatch.se/projects/pylibmc/.. image:: https://github.com/lericson/pylibmc/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg   :target: https://github.com/lericson/pylibmc/actions/workflows/ci.ymlNew in version 1.6.0====================Though no major feature overhauls have taken place, this release is partiallyincompatible with 1.5.0. This stems from the fact that python-memcached is nowusing a flag that pylibmc has been using for some years. python-memcached usesit for a different purpose, and an incompatible one. We deemed that it would bebetter to support this interoperability. The change also means that Unicodestrings are now stored as UTF-8 rather than pickled, which may or may notresult in a slight performance improvement for this type of data.We have also introduced a `pickle_protocol` behavior to enable seamlessinteroperability between Python 2.x and 3.x. Also, this release introduces aManyLinux wheel, making installation a breeze on ManyLinux systems (which Isuppose is many linuxes.)New in version 1.5.0====================This release fixes critical memory leaks in common code paths introduced in1.4.2. Also fixes a critical bug in a corner of the zlib inflation code, whereprior memory errors would trigger a double free. Thank you to everybodyinvolved in the making of this release, and especially `Eau de Web`__, withouttheir contributions, this release and the bug fixes it contains wouldn't havebeen so expedient.__ http://www.eaudeweb.ro/.. comment: 1.5.x should have been an extension to 1.4.x, therefore it's best   to keep the 1.4.x release announcement below.New in version 1.4.0====================Brace yourself, Python 3.x support has come!Thanks to everybody involved in this project; this release involves lessauthors but **a lot** more work per person. Thanks especially to Harvey Falcicfor the work he put in, without which there wouldn't be any Python 3.x support.Also thanks to Sergey Pashinin for the initial stab at the problem.Other than that, we had miscellaneous bug fixes, testing improvements, anddocumentation updates.Last but not least I would like to ask for your support in this project, eitherby helping out with development, testing, documentation or anything at all; orsimply by donating some `magic internet money`__ to the project's Bitcoinaddress `12dveKhqiJWCY8zXT4kaHdHELXPeGAUo9h`__.__ http://static.adzerk.net/Advertisers/5af77cf0094d4303bb308b955dd05992.jpg__ bitcoin:12dveKhqiJWCY8zXT4kaHdHELXPeGAUo9hLicense=======Released under the BSD 3-clause license; see `LICENSE &lt;LICENSE&gt;`_ for details.Maintainer==========- Website: `sendapatch.se/ &lt;http://sendapatch.se/&gt;`_- Github: `github.com/lericson &lt;http://github.com/lericson&gt;`_- IRC: ``lericson`` in ``#sendapatch`` on ``chat.freenode.net``- E-mail: ``ludvig`` at ``sendapatch.se``------.. image:: http://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20110908.gif   :target: http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=2362   :align: center</longdescription>
