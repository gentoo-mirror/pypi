	<longdescription># ArmoniK.Api Python packageThis folder contains the necessary scripts to generate the ArmoniK.Api Python package. Please note that while the package generation is platform dependent, the generated package *should* be compatible with Linux and Windows.## Install the Python Package from PyPIAt each release, we provide a prepackaged version of ArmoniK.Api available on PyPI here : [https://pypi.org/project/armonik](https://pypi.org/project/armonik).To install the package to your current Python environment, you can use pip :```pip install armonik```## Linux / [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)### **How to generate**Requirements :- Python &gt;= 3.7- Python3-venv- Pip3- BashIf the python command doesn't link to python3 on your system, you may be able to install the package python-is-python3, which links python to python3.To generate the package from sources, run the [proto2python.sh](proto2python.sh) script from its folder. You need to specify a directory where the virtual environment used for the build will be located. For example the following command will generate the packages and will create the build environment &quot;pyvenv&quot; in the current user's home directory:```bash./proto2python.sh ~/pyvenv```3 folders will be created :- generated : contains the source files used to create the package- build : contains the source files used to create the wheel package- pkg : contains the sdist and wheel packages### **How to install the generated package**From this directory, use the following command:```code pip install pkg/armonik*.whl```The generated package will be installed to your current python environment## WindowsComing soon</longdescription>
