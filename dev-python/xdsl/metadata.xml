Users of xDSL build a compiler byassembling predefined domain-specific IRs and, optionally, defining their own custom IRs. xDSL uses multi-level IRs, meaningthat during the compilation process, a program will be lowered through severalof these IRs. This allows the implementation of abstraction-specificoptimization passes, similar to the structure of common DSL compilers (such asDevito, Psyclone, and Firedrake). To simplify the writing of these passes, xDSLuses a uniform data structure based on SSA, basic blocks, and regions, whichadditionally enables the writing of generic passes.The design of xDSL is influenced by [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/), a compilerframework developed in C++, that is part of the LLVM project. An inherentadvantage of a close design is the easy interaction between the two frameworks,making it possible to translate abstractions and programs back and forth. Thisresults in one big SSA-based abstraction ecosystem that can be worked withthrough Python, making analysis through simple scripting languages possible.Additionally, xDSL can leverage MLIR's code generation and low-leveloptimization capabilities.- [Installation](#installation)- [Using xDSL](#using-xdsl)- [xDSL Developer Setup](#xdsl-developer-setup)  - [Developer Installation](#developer-installation)  - [Testing](#testing)  - [Formatting](#formatting)## InstallationTo use xDSL as part of a larger project for developing your own compiler,just install [xDSL via pip](https://pypi.org/project/xdsl/):```bashpip install xdsl```*Note:* This version of xDSL is validated against a specific MLIR version,interoperability with other versions may result in problems. The supportedMLIR version is commit `04fc02e583b06b846315904a55af9c273c8b20b9`.## Getting StartedTo get familiar with xDSL, we recommend starting with our Jupyter notebooks. Thenotebooks consist of examples and documentation concerning the core xDSL datastructures and the xDSL's Python-embedded abstraction definition language, aswell as examples of implementing custom compilers, like a database compiler.There also exists a small documentation showing how to connect xDSL with MLIRfor users interested in that use case.- [A Database example](https://xdsl.dev/xdsl/retro/notebooks/?path=database_example.ipynb)- [A simple introduction](https://xdsl.dev/xdsl/retro/notebooks/?path=tutorial.ipynb)- [A DSL for defining new IRs](https://xdsl.dev/xdsl/retro/notebooks/?path=irdl.ipynb)- [Connecting xDSL with MLIR](docs/mlir_interoperation.md)We provide a Makefile containing a lot of common tasks, which might providean overview of common actions.## xDSL Developer SetupTo contribute to the development of xDSL follow the subsequent steps.### Developer Installation```bashgit clone https://github.com/xdslproject/xdsl.gitcd xdsl# set up the venv and install everythingmake venv# activate the venvsource venv/bin/activate```### TestingThe xDSL project uses pytest unit tests and LLVM-style filecheck tests. They canbe executed from the root directory:```bash# Executes pytests which are located in tests/pytest# Executes filecheck testslit tests/filecheck# run all tests using makefilemake tests```### Formatting and TypecheckingAll python code used in xDSL uses [black](https://github.com/psf/black) toformat the code in a uniform manner.To automate the formatting, we use pre-commit hooks from the[pre-commit](https://pypi.org/project/pre-commit/) package.```bash# Install the pre-commit on your `.git` foldermake precommit-install# to run the hooks:make precommit# alternatively, running black on all staged files:make black  # or simply black $(git diff --staged --name-only)```Furthermore, all python code must run through [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright)without errors. Pyright can be run on all staged files through themakefile using `make pyright`.### DiscussionYou can also join the discussion at our [Zulip chat room](https://xdsl.zulipchat.com), kindly supported by community hosting from [Zulip](https://zulip.com/).</longdescription>
