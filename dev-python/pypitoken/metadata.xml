They allowthe bearer to add additional restrictions to an existing token. For example, givena PyPI token that can upload releases for any project of its owner, you can generatea token that will only allow some projects, or even a single one... _macaroons: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaroons_(computer_science)Here's an example:.. code-block:: console    $ pip install pypitoken.. code-block:: python    import pypitoken    token = pypitoken.Token.load(&quot;pypi-foobartoken&quot;)    print(token.restrictions)    # [ProjectIDsRestriction(project_ids=[&quot;00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&quot;])]    token.restrict(project_names=[&quot;requests&quot;])    print(token.restrictions)    # [    #     ProjectIDsRestriction(project_ids=[&quot;00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&quot;]),    #     ProjectNamesRestriction(project_names=[&quot;requests&quot;]),    # ]    token.dump()    # pypi-newfoobartokenThis token we've created above will be restricted to uploading releases of ``requests``.Of course, your PyPI user will still need to have upload permissions on ``requests``for this to happen.The aim of this library is to provide a simple toolbelt for manipulating PyPI tokens.Ideally, someday, PyPI (Warehouse_) itself may generate their tokens using thislibrary too. This should make it easier to iterate on new kinds of restrictions forPyPI tokens, such as those discussed in the `original implementation issue`__... _Warehouse: https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/.. __: https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/994A discussion for integrating this library to the Warehouse environment is ongoing:- In the `Python Packaging discussions`_ for putting the project under the PyPA umbrella- In the `Warehouse tracker`_ for replacing the current macaroon implementation with  this lib.. _`Python Packaging discussions`: https://discuss.python.org/t/pypitoken-a-library-for-generating-and-manipulating-pypi-tokens/7572.. _`Warehouse tracker`: https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/9184.. Below this line is content specific to the README that will not appear in the doc... end-of-index-docWhere to go from here---------------------The complete docs_ is probably the best place to learn about the project.If you encounter a bug, or want to get in touch, you're always welcome to open aticket_... _docs: http://pypitoken.readthedocs.io/en/latest.. _ticket: https://github.com/ewjoachim/pypitoken/issues/new</longdescription>
