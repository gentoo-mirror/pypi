	<longdescription># FlowcliThis is a command line tool to interact with [convisoappsec] flow api. This aims to be very useful for integrations development.# InstallationTo install flowcli some dependecies are required:* python3 &gt;= 3.4. See [python3 download]* pip. See [pip guide]* git. See [git download]* Docker. See [docker download]If you have system admin privileges just execute one of the following commands.```shpip install conviso-flowcli```or```shpython3 -m pip install conviso-flowcli```If you haven't system admin privileges execute one of the following commands.```shpip install --user conviso-flowcli```or```shpython3 -m pip install --user conviso-flowcli```Check if the install command was well succeeded.```shflow --version```The command will print the current version and exit with success. Now we are ready to proceed.# Getting started## OverviewThe primary goal of the flowcli aims to be a developer friendly tool. The tool will automate as many steps as possible to decrease spent time on an integration with [appsec flow]. Using this tool the integration with your [CI/CD] platform will be easy. At your [CI/CD] you be able to perform [SAST] and [DAST] analysis, send source code to be reviewed by our analysts and order features availables in your [appsec flow account].# Shell CompletionThis section will guide you to activate the flow shell completion. This is not required to use the tool so you can skip it if you want. ## BashOpen your .bashrc file at ~/.bashrc and place the following snippet in the end of file.```shFLOW_COMPLETER=&quot;$(which flow_bash_completer.sh)&quot;[ -f &quot;$FLOW_COMPLETER&quot; ] &amp;&amp; {  source &quot;$FLOW_COMPLETER&quot;}```Start a new bash shell session and the shell completion will be available.## ZshOpen your .zshrc file at ~/.zshrc and place the following snippet in the end of file.```shFLOW_COMPLETER=&quot;$(which flow_zsh_completer.sh)&quot;[ -f &quot;$FLOW_COMPLETER&quot; ] &amp;&amp; {  source &quot;$FLOW_COMPLETER&quot;}```Start a new zsh shell session and the shell completion will be available.## FishStart a fish shell session and execute the following command.```shmkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completionscp (which flow_fish_completer.fish) ~/.config/fish/completions/flow.fish```Start a new fish shell session and the shell completion will be available.## Main commandThe main command of flowcli is flow. To see the command help run the following command.```shflow -h```or```shflow --help```## AuthenticationTo start with flowcli an [appsec flow] api key(See [generating api key]) will be necessary. After you got it you can export the key as system environment variableand use the flowcli.```shexport FLOW_API_KEY='you-api-key'```or the api key can be set as option argument```shflow --api-key 'you-api-key' [SOME COMMAND]```## Static program analysis(SAST)With the flowcli is very simple to perform a SAST at your source code repository. Let's see some examples.### Reporting the SAST results to [Flow AppSec] APITo report the SAST result to flow api a project code will be required. The project is created at [Flow AppSec] Web View. See [creating project].Assuming that my_source_code_repository is a git repository, so:```shexport FLOW_API_KEY='your-api-key'export FLOW_PROJECT_CODE='your-project-code'cd my_source_code_repositoryflow sast run```The following instructions has the same effect.```shcd my_source_code_repositoryflow --api-key 'your-api-key' sast run --project-code 'your-project-code'```[python3 download]: &lt;https://www.python.org/downloads/&gt;[git download]: &lt;https://git-scm.com/downloads&gt;[pip guide]: &lt;https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-from-pypi&gt;[docker download]: &lt;https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/&gt;[bash]: &lt;https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/&gt;[zsh]: &lt;https://www.zsh.org/&gt;[fish]: &lt;https://fishshell.com/&gt;[convisoappsec]: &lt;https://convisoappsec.com/&gt;[generating api key]: &lt;https://appsecflow.helpy.io/&gt;[generating project code]: &lt;https://appsecflow.helpy.io/&gt;[appsec flow]: &lt;https://appsecflow.helpy.io/&gt;[CI/CD]: &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD&gt;[SAST]: &lt;https://blog.convisoappsec.com/en/code-review-and-sast-whats-the-difference/&gt;[DAST]: &lt;https://blog.convisoappsec.com/en/code-review-and-sast-whats-the-difference/&gt;[creating project]: &lt;https://appsecflow.helpy.io/&gt;[appsec flow account]: &lt;https://appsecflow.helpy.io/&gt;[Flow AppSec]: &lt;https://app.conviso.com.br/&gt;</longdescription>
