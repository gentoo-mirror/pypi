Medical terminologies are often used to encodethe type of care : diagnoses, acts, drugs, laboratory, ...Such healthcare trajectories can be viewed as sequence of tokens, similarly tosequences of words.This package propose to use matrix factorization as a simple and efficient wayto build event embedding from a medical observational database.</longdescription>
