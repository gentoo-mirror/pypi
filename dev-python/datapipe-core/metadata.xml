	<longdescription># Datapipe`datapipe` is a realtime incremental ETL library for Python application.# DevelopmentAt the moment these branches are active:* `master` - current development state, will be promoted to `0.13.x` series  release once ready* `v0.12` - current stable version* `v0.11` - legacy stable version# Version compatibilityAt the moment, the datapipe library is under active development. Versions:`v0.*.*`It should be expected that each minor version is not backward compatible withthe previous one. That is, `v0.7.0` is not compatible with `v0.6.1`. Dependenciesshould be fixed to the exact minor version.After stabilization and transition to the major version `v1.*.*`, the commonrules will apply: all versions with the same major component are compatible.</longdescription>
