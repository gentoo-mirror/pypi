	<longdescription>siphash24: Streaming-capable SipHash Implementation===================================================This module provides a C-based implementation of `SipHash`__ with aninterface compatible with the hash functions provided by the`hashlib`__ standard library module.  SipHash-1-3 and SipHash-2-4variants are currently implemented.  The module `documentation`__provides a detailed description of the API.This module differs from other similar modules by providing astreaming-capable implementation and an interface compatible to thehash functions provided by the ``hashlib`` standard library module andby providing binary wheels for all supported Python releases on themost common platforms.  More platforms can be added to the build jobas needed.Following the ``hashlib`` interface, the return value of the``digest()`` method is a ``bytes`` object.  SipHash values arecustomarily stored as 64-bit integers.  This module extends the``hashlib`` interface with an additional ``intdigest()`` method thatreturns the hash values as a 64-bit signed int object.This module is implemented as a thin `Cython`__-based wrapper around aC language SipHash implementation copied, with minimal modificationsto allow compilation with MSCV, from the `c-siphash library`__ byDavid Rheinsberg and co-authors.  The c-siphash library is based onthe SipHash `reference implementation`__ by Jean-Philippe Aumasson andDaniel J. Bernstein released to the Public Domain.  This module isdistributed with the same license as the c-siphash library:`Apache-2.0`__ or `LGPL-2.1-or-later`__.__ https://cr.yp.to/siphash/siphash-20120918.pdf__ https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html__ https://dnicolodi.github.io/python-siphash24/__ https://cython.org/__ https://github.com/c-util/c-siphash__ https://github.com/veorq/SipHash__ https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html__ https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1-or-later.html</longdescription>
