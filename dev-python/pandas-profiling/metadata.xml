	<longdescription># pandas-profiling---‚ö†Ô∏è **`pandas-profiling` package naming was changed. To continue profiling data use [`ydata-profiling`](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling) instead!** This repo implements the brownout strategy for deprecating the pandas-profiling package on PyPI.‚ö†Ô∏è---&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/assets/logo_header.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pandas Profiling Logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;### üéä New year, new face, more functionalities! &gt; Thank you for using and following ``pandas-profiling`` developments. Yet, we have a new exciting feature - we are now thrilled to announce&gt; that &lt;u&gt;Spark&lt;/u&gt; is now part of the Data Profiling family from version 4.0.0 onwards&gt; &gt; With its introduction, there was also the need for a new naming, one that will allow to decouple the concept of profiling from the Pandas Dataframes - `ydata-profiling`! &gt; &gt; But fear not, `pip install pandas-profiling` will still be a valid for a while, and we will keep investing in growing the best open-source for data profiling, so you can use it for even more use cases.# How to fix the error for the main use cases- use `pip install ydata-profiling` rather than `pip install pandas-profiling`- replace `pandas-profiling` by `ydata-profiling` in your pip requirements files (requirements.txt, setup.py, setup.cfg, Pipfile, etc ...)- if the `pandas-profiling` package is used by one of your dependencies it would be great if you take some time to track which package uses `pandas_profiling` instead of `ydata_profiling` for the imports## Schedule for deprecation- `ydata-profiling` was launched in February 1st. - `pip install pandas-profiling` will still be supported until **April 1st**, but a warning will be thrown. `from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport` will be supported until April 1st.- After April 1st, an error will be thrown if `pip install pandas-profiling` is used. Use `pip install ydata-profiling` instead.- After April 1st, an error will be thrown if `from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport` is used. Use `from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport` instead.### About pandas-profiling`pandas-profiling` primary goal is to provide a one-line Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) experience in a consistent and fast solution. Like pandas `df.describe()` function, that is so handy, pandas-profiling delivers an extended analysis of a DataFrame while alllowing the data analysis to be exported in different formats such as **html** and **json**.The package outputs a simple and digested analysis of a dataset, including **time-series** and **text**. &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandas-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/master/&quot;&gt;Documentation&lt;/a&gt;  |  &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.com/invite/mw7xjJ7b7s&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;  |   &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas-profiling&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;  |  &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandas-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/master/pages/reference/changelog.html#changelog&quot;&gt;Latest changelog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  Do you like this project?
