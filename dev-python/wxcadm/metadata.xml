	<longdescription># wxcadmPython Library for Webex Calling Administration# Purposewxcadm is a Python 3 library to simplify the API calls to Webex in order to manage and report on users of Webex Calling.Although the primary focus is Webex Calling, many of the other Webex admin functions are included. This library is notmeant to be an interface to the Meetings and Messaging capabilities of Webex....there are plenty of other modules thatprovide that.# Installation**wxcadm** is available as a [PIP Package](https://pypi.org/project/wxcadm/)```$ python -m pip install wxcadm```# QuickstartBy creating a Webex instance with a valid API Access Token, the module will pull the Webex Organization information aswell as all the People within the Organization. The Org instance will contain all People, whether they have the Webex Calling service or not. An Org method ```get_webex_people()``` makes it easy to get only the People that haveWebex Calling.You can obtain a 12-hour access token by logging into https://developer.webex.com and visiting the **Getting Started**page.Once you have the access token, the following will initialize the API connection and pull data```pythonimport wxcadmaccess_token = &quot;Your API Access Token&quot;webex = wxcadm.Webex(access_token)```Since most administrators only have access to a single Webex Organization, you can access that Organization with the**org** attribute. If the administrator has access to more than one Organization, they can be accessed using the**orgs** attribute, which is a list of the organizations that can be managed. See the &quot;Regarding Multiple Organizations&quot; section below for further information.You can see all the attributes with```pythonvars(webex.org)```Note that, by default, all the People are pulled when the Org is initialized. For large organizations, this may takea while, but then all the People are stored as Person objects.To iterate over the list of people, simply loop through the **people** attribute of the Org. For example:```pythonfor person in webex.org.people:    # Print all of the attributes of the Person    print(vars(person))    # Or access the attributes directly    email = person.email```# Documentation**wxcadm** documentation is housed at [Read The Docs](https://wxcadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). </longdescription>
