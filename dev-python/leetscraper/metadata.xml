This scraper currently works for [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com &quot;leetcode website&quot;), [codechef.com](https://codechef.com &quot;codechef website&quot;), [codewars.com](https://codewars.com &quot;codewars website&quot;), [hackerrank.com](https://hackerrank.com &quot;hackerrank website&quot;), [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net &quot;projecteuler website&quot;). It was created as a way to gather coding problems to solve without having to sign up to a website or submit your code to a checker.***# Usage  ### Install packageInstalling leetscraper with pip will also install python dependencies needed. Chrome or Firefox are also required for this scraper to work.```pythonpython3 -m pip install leetscraper```### ExamplesImport the module and Initialize the class. The class has some kwargs options to control the behaviour of the scraper.However, all the default values will start to scrape all problems from leetcode.com to the cwd.  The most basic usage looks like this:```pythonfrom leetscraper import Leetscraperif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    Leetscraper()```The avaliable kwargs to control the behaviour of the scraper are:```python&quot;&quot;&quot;website_name: name of a supported website to scrape (&quot;leetcode.com&quot; set if ignored)scrape_path: &quot;path/to/save/scraped_problems&quot; (Current working directory set if ignored)scrape_limit: integer of how many problems to scrape at a time (no limit set if ignored)auto_scrape: &quot;True&quot;, &quot;False&quot; (True set if ignored)&quot;&quot;&quot;```For further examples on how to use keyword arguments, or manually using class methods, please see [ADVANCED_USAGE.md](https://github.com/Pavocracy/leetscraper/blob/main/docs/ADVANCED_USAGE.md &quot;Advanced usage doc&quot;)### InformationHow fast and reliable this scraper performs will change depending on things like which website you are scraping and your internet connection. There is also no guarantee that as these websites add new problems, that they will use the same class names in their html tags. Expect things to break and for some requests to fail. leetscraper.log will contain urls of failed scrapes if you wish to grab these manually, or run the scraperagain and see if the failures were just timeouts or dropped requests. Your mileage absolutely WILL vary, but as a rough point of reference of what you can expect, here is the results of a complete and unlimited test scrape.     *10 hours, 30 minutes and 40 seconds to scrape 15665 problems from 5 websites with an error rate of 0.54%*```14/02/2022 12:52:53 PM [INFO]: Getting the list of leetcode.com problems to scrape14/02/2022 12:52:54 PM [INFO]: Attempting to scrape 1694 leetcode.com problems14/02/2022 02:51:05 PM [DEBUG]: Scraping 1693 leetcode.com problems took 7088 seconds14/02/2022 02:51:05 PM [WARNING]: Scraped 1693 problems, but 1 problems failed!
