Search for projects with *visualization* as a keyword and *python* as a language.Sort by the number of stars... code:: python    from pybraries.search import Search    search = Search()    info = search.project_search(keywords='visualization', sort='stars', platform='pypi')    print(info)A list of dictionaries with project names and other project information is returned.Note that the Libraries.io API is rate limited to 60 requests per minute.All libraries.io methods are implemented, except updating a subscription to not include prereleases.

Many owners and repos also share the same name.Further, many owners are also users.
