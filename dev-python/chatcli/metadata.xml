If you could only communicate through interpretive dance for the next 24 hours, how would you go about your day?2. You wake up in a world where everyone speaks in rhyme. How do you adapt to this unusual circumstance?3. You can only speak in questions for the rest of the day. How do you navigate conversations with friends, co-workers, and strangers?```## InstallationTo install ChatCLI, use pip:```pip install chatcli```You'll need an OpenAI API key to use ChatCLI. You can get one [here](https://beta.openai.com/).ChatCLI reads your key from the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, so you'll also need to set that.## Usage### CLI UsageTo use ChatCLI, simply run the `chatcli` command:```chatcli```This will start a chat session with the default OpenAI model.
