List/start/stop processes in   the guest system.- Create and delete snapshots- Get hosts statistics and monitor performanceAn of course, you can use it to access all the vSphere API through python.It's built upon a slightly modified version of ZSI_ (that comes bundled-in) which makes it really fast in contrast to other python SOAP libraries that don'tprovide code generation... _ZSI: http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/zsi.htmlInstallation------------The simplest way is using setuptools_' easy_install:.. _setuptools: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools::  easy_install -U pysphereOr using the pip_:.. _pip: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip::  pip install -U pysphereYou can aslo find the source package and windows installer in the downloads_ section. To install it from the source package:.. _downloads: http://code.google.com/p/pysphere/downloads/list1. Unzip the package2. run: ``python setup.py install``Quick Example-------------Here's how you power on a virtual machine.
