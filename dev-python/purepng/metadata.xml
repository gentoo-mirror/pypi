	<longdescription>PurePNG allows PNG image files to be read and written using pure Python.PurePNG can read and write all PNG formats.PNG supports a generous variety of image formats: RGB or greyscale, with orwithout an alpha channel; and a choice of bit depths from 1, 2 or 4(as long as you want greyscale or a pallete),8, and 16 (but 16 bits is not allowed for palettes).A pixel can vary in size from 1 to 64 bits: 1/2/4/8/16/24/32/48/64.In addition a PNG file can be interlaced or not.An interlaced file allows an incrementally refined display of images beingdownloaded over slow links (yet it`s not implemented in PurePNG for now).PurePNG is written in pure Python(that`s why it`s called Pure).</longdescription>
