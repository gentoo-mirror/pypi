	<longdescription>This is a SHA-256 implementation that allows for setting and gettingthe mid-state information. This was needed to enable repeated hashingagainst a (potentially large) fixed prefix.Performance===========The original version of this was written in Python. While the Cythonversion will be much faster, this is not a highly optimized library andrelies on the native C compiler for optimization.Cythonize=========This repository does not contain the generated C code from Cython. Torecreate the C code run the cytnonize step via::    python setup.py sdistAuthors=======The original author was Thomas Dixon for a python version of this code.Sam Rushing added the midstate access and converted it to Cython_.Nigel Drego added the context state setter/getter.LICENSE=======This is licensed under the `MIT license`_ based on the originallicense from Thomas Dixon... _Cython: http://cython.org.. _`MIT license`: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT</longdescription>
