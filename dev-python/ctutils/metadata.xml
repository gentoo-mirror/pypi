	<longdescription>.. -*- rst -*-========CT Utils========This project provides a set of small utilities for processing data from CTscanners in a variety of formats. Currently, the supported formats are:* Xradia's TXM format* Volume Graphics VGI+VOL format* Grayscale TIFF stacks (8-bit, 16-bit)At the moment, the project's goal is to produce a set of simple command linetools for batch processing of CT scans, and an API to permit easy access toscan data from Python... note::    Please note that our understanding of several of the formats above is    limited (in particular TXM and VGI+VOL), specifically in terms of the data    types supported within these files.    If you encounter a file which does not work with CT Utils, please file a    `bug report &lt;bug tracker&gt;`_ so that we can enhance the suite. Obviously    example files make debugging easier, but we understand there may be    confidentiality issues with certain scans (publication embargoes, medical    privacy, etc.). If this applies to your scans, please do not attach them to    the bug report!Links=====* The project is licensed under the `GPL v3`_ or above* Project `source code`_ is hosted by GitHub which also hosts the `bug tracker`_* The `documentation`_ is hosted by ReadTheDocs.. _documentation: http://ctutils.readthedocs.org/.. _source code: https://github.com/waveform80/ctutils.. _bug tracker: https://github.com/waveform80/ctutils/issues.. _GPL v3: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html</longdescription>
