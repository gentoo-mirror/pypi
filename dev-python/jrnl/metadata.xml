Journals arestored as human-readable plain text, and can also be encrypted using  [AESencryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard).## In a NutshellTo make a new entry, just enter``` shjrnl yesterday: Called in sick. Used the time to clean the house and write mybook.````yesterday:` is  interpreted by `jrnl` as a timestamp. Everything until thefirst sentence ending (either `.`, `?`, or `!`) is interpreted as the title, andthe rest as the body. In your journal file, the result will look like this:    [2012-03-29 09:00] Called in sick.    Used the time to clean the house and write my book.If you just call `jrnl`, you will be prompted to compose your entry - but youcan also configure _jrnl_ to use your external editor.For more information, please read the[documentation](https://jrnl.sh).## Contributors### MaintainersOur maintainers help keep the lights on for the project: * Jonathan Wren ([wren](https://github.com/wren)) * Micah Ellison ([micahellison](https://github.com/micahellison))Please thank them if you like `jrnl`!### Code ContributorsThis project is made with love by the many fabulous people who have contributed.`jrnl` couldn't exist without each and every one of you!&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jrnl-org/jrnl/graphs/contributors&quot;&gt;&lt;imgsrc=&quot;https://opencollective.com/jrnl/contributors.svg?width=890&amp;button=false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you'd also like to help make `jrnl` better, please see our [contributingdocumentation](docs/contributing.md).### Financial BackersAnother way show support is through direct financial contributions.
