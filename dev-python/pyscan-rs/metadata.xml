PRs and issue makers welcome.## üïäÔ∏è Install```bash&gt; pip install pyscan-rs```**look out for the &quot;-rs&quot;** partor```bash&gt; cargo install pyscan```check out the [releases](https://github.com/aswinnnn/pyscan/releases).## üêá UsageGo to your python source directory (or wherever you keep your `requirements.txt`/`pyproject.toml`) and run:```bash&gt; pyscan```or```bash&gt; pyscan -d path/to/src```## Docker[WARNING: docker subcommand currently does not work, if you are installing pyscan solely for that purpose. It will be fixed and released in the next version. Thanks for the patience, people with actual jobs (i dont know anyone else who actually uses docker)]Pyscan can scan inside docker images given you provide the correct path inside. This is still in its early stage and may break easily.```bash&gt; pyscan docker -n my-docker-image -p /path/inside/container/to/source```by &lt;i&gt;&quot;source&quot;&lt;/i&gt; I mean `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml` or your python files.Note: Your docker engine/daemon should be running as pyscan utilizes the `docker create` command. &lt;br&gt;Here's the order of precedence for a &quot;source&quot; file:+ `requirements.txt`+ `pyproject.toml`+ your python source code (`.py`) [highly discouraged]Pyscan will find dependency versions from `pip` if not provided within the source file. Even though, **Make sure you version-ize your requirements** and use proper [pep-508 syntax](https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/).## Building pyscan requires a rust version of `&lt; v1.70`, as it uses `once_cell` which is unstable on previous releases.There's an overview of the codebase coming soon for people who wanna contribute. Appreciate all the help so far.## ü¶Ä Notepyscan uses [OSV](https://osv.dev) as its database for now. There are plans to add a few more.pyscan doesn't make sure your code is safe from everything. Use all resources available to you like Dependabot, `pip-audit` or trivy.## üê∞ TodoAs of June 27, 2023:- [ ] Gather time to work on it (incredible task as a high schooler)- [ ] Multi-threading- [ ] Better display, search, filter of vulns- [ ] Plethora of output options (stick to &gt;&gt; for now)- [x] Architecture write-up  ## üêπ SponsorWhile not coding, I am a broke high school student with nothing else to do. I appreciate all the help I can get.</longdescription>
