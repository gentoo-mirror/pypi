	<longdescription># IsosurfacesConstruct isolines/isosurfaces of a 2D/3D scalar field defined by a function, i.e. curves over which `f(x,y)=0` or surfaces over which `f(x,y,z)=0`. Most similar libraries use marching squares or similar over a uniform grid, but this uses a quadtree to avoid wasting time sampling many far from the implicit surface.This library is based on the approach described in [Manson, Josiah, and Scott Schaefer. &quot;Isosurfaces over simplicial partitions of multiresolution grids.&quot; Computer Graphics Forum. Vol. 29. No. 2. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2010](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/schaefer/research/iso_simplicial.pdf).An example graph, including quad lines, of `y(x-y)^2 = 4x+8` (Python expression: `y*(x-y)**2 - 4*x - 8`)&lt;!-- Using jsdelivr here to work in the PyPI description --&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jared-hughes/isosurfaces/assets/demo.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Demo with grid lines&quot; height=300&gt;## Installation```shpip3 install isosurfaces```## Usage```pyfrom isosurfaces import plot_isolineimport numpy as npdef f(x, y):    return y * (x - y) ** 2 - 4 * x - 8curves = plot_isoline(    lambda u: f(u[0], u[1]),    np.array([-8, -6]),    np.array([8, 6]),    # Increasing min_depth can help if you have small features    min_depth=3,    # Ensure max_quads is more than 4**min_depth to capture details better    # than a 2**min_depth by 2**min_depth uniform grid    max_quads=1000,)for curve in curves:    print(', '.join(f&quot;({p[0]:.3f},{p[1]:.3f})&quot; for p in curve))```## Dev examples```shpython3 examples/isoline_demo.py &amp;&amp; xdg-open https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jared-hughes/isosurfaces/assets/demo.svgmanim -pql examples/isosurface_demo.py --renderer=opengl --enable_gui```Pyflakes, allowing manim star imports```shpython3 -m pyflakes . | grep -v &quot;star imports: manim&quot;```Build source archive and wheel:```shrm -rf dist build isosurfaces.egg-infopython3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheeltwine check dist/*# for test:twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*# for actualtwine upload dist/*```## RelatedRelated projects:- (2D, grid-based) https://pypi.org/project/meander/- (2D, grid-based) https://pypi.org/project/contours/- (Archived) https://github.com/AaronWatters/contouristOther terms for an isoline:- Contour- Level curve- Topographic map</longdescription>
