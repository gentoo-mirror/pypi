	<longdescription>pytesmo - a Python Toolbox for the Evaluation of Soil Moisture Observations***************************************************************************.. image:: https://github.com/TUW-GEO/pytesmo/workflows/Automated%20Tests/badge.svg?branch=master   :target: https://github.com/TUW-GEO/pytesmo/actions.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/TUW-GEO/pytesmo/badge.png?branch=master  :target: https://coveralls.io/r/TUW-GEO/pytesmo?branch=master.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/pytesmo.svg    :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/pytesmo.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/pytesmo/badge/?version=latest    :target: https://pytesmo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latestpytesmo, the Python Toolbox for the Evaluation of Soil Moisture Observations, isa package/python toolbox which aims to provide a library that can be used forthe comparison and validation of geospatial time series datasets with a(initial) focus on soil moisture.Documentation &amp; Software Citation=================================.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.596422.svg   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.596422To see the latest `full documentation &lt;https://pytesmo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest&gt;`_click on the docs badge at the top.If you use the software in a publication then please cite it using the ZenodoDOI.  Be aware that this badge links to the latest package version.Please select your specific version at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.596422 toget the DOI of that version.  You should normally always use the DOI for thespecific version of your record in citations.  This is to ensure that otherresearchers can access the exact research artefact you used forreproducibility.You can find additional information regarding DOI versioning athttp://help.zenodo.org/#versioningIf you want to contribute, take a look at the `developers guide&lt;https://github.com/TUW-GEO/pytesmo/blob/master/DEVELOPERS_GUIDE.md&gt;`_ .Installation============This package should be installable through `pip&lt;https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html&gt;`__ which downloads the packagefrom the `python package repository Pypi &lt;https://pypi.python.org/&gt;`__.However, pytesmo also needs some packages that depend on C or Fortran libraries (like ``netCDF4``).They should be installed first with conda or mamba. We recommend installing `Mambaforge &lt;https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge&gt;`__.Then the following command should install all dependencies:.. code-block:: bash    mamba install -c conda-forge numpy scipy pandas netCDF4 cython pyresampleAfterwards ``pytesmo`` can be installed via pip... code-block:: bash    pip install pytesmoAs an alternative (e.g. if you want to contribute to the package), you canclone the Github repository and install from source:.. code::    git clone https://github.com/TUW-GEO/pytesmo.git --recursive    cd pytesmo    mamba create -n pytesmo python=3.10 # or any supported python version    conda activate pytesmo    mamba env update -f environment.yml -n pytesmo    pip install -e .Supported Products==================Soil moisture is observed using different methods and instruments, in thisversion several satellite datasets as well as in situ and reanalysis data are supportedthrough independent and optional (reader) packages:- `ERS &amp; H-SAF ASCAT products &lt;https://github.com/TUW-GEO/ascat/&gt;`_- `SMAP &lt;https://github.com/TUW-GEO/smap_io/&gt;`_- `GLDAS Noah &lt;https://github.com/TUW-GEO/gldas/&gt;`_- `ERA5 and ERA5-Land &lt;https://github.com/TUW-GEO/ecmwf_models/&gt;`_- `SMOS &lt;https://github.com/TUW-GEO/smos/&gt;`_- `C3S SM &lt;https://github.com/TUW-GEO/c3s_sm/&gt;`_- `ESA CCI SM &lt;https://github.com/TUW-GEO/esa_cci_sm/&gt;`_- `MERRA &lt;https://github.com/TUW-GEO/merra/&gt;`_- `Data from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) &lt;https://github.com/TUW-GEO/ismn/&gt;`_    In case of the ISMN, two different formats are provided:    An example of how to use the dataset in the pytesmo validation framework can be    found in the &quot;Examples&quot; chapter.    * Variables stored in separate files (CEOP formatted)Related Packages================Some former pytesmo modules are now provided as separate packages.- `pygeogrids &lt;https://github.com/TUW-GEO/pygeogrids/&gt;`_ : Creation and handling of Discrete Global Grids or Point collections- `cadati &lt;https://github.com/TUW-GEO/cadati/&gt;`_ : Calender, Date and Time functions- `repurpose &lt;https://github.com/TUW-GEO/repurpose/&gt;`_ : Time series - image conversion and resampling routines- `colorella &lt;https://github.com/TUW-GEO/colorella/&gt;`_ : Color maps and color map handlingContribute==========We are happy if you want to contribute. Please raise an issue explaining whatis missing or if you find a bug. We will also gladly accept pull requestsagainst our master branch for new features or bug fixes.Please follow the `developers guide&lt;https://github.com/TUW-GEO/pytesmo/blob/master/DEVELOPERS_GUIDE.md&gt;`_.</longdescription>
