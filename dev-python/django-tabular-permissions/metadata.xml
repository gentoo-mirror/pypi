'tabular_permissions',    ]Finally, execute::    python manage.py collectstaticthen navigate to User and/or Group change form to see `tabular_permissions` in action.Configuration:--------------Tabular_permissions possible configurations and their default::    TABULAR_PERMISSIONS_CONFIG = {        'template': 'tabular_permissions/admin/tabular_permissions.html',        'exclude': {            'override': False,            'apps': [],            'models': [],            'function':'tabular_permissions.helpers.dummy_permissions_exclude'        },        'auto_implement': True,        'use_for_concrete': False,        'custom_permission_translation': 'tabular_permissions.helpers.custom_permissions_translator',        'apps_customization_func': 'tabular_permissions.helpers.apps_customization_func',        'custom_permissions_customization_func': 'tabular_permissions.helpers.custom_permissions_customization_func',    }`template`  the template which contains the permissions table, you can always customize this template by extending or overriding.  Notice that there is a `style` block which you can override to easily edit the css.`exclude`  Control which apps, models to show in the permissions table.  By default ``tabular_permissions`` exclude `sessions` , `contenttypes` and `admin` apps from showing their models in the permissions table. If you want to show them you can switch ``override`` to `False`.  ``apps`` &amp; ``models`` lists would contain the names of the apps and models you wish to exclude.  ``function`` is a dotted path of a custom function which receive the model as a parameter to decide either to exclude it or not, default to a dummy function that always return False (ie do not exclude)auto_implement  By default, just by including `tabular_permissions` in your installed_apps, the ``django.contrib.admin.UserAdmin`` (and ``GroupAdmin``) are &quot;patched&quot; to include the tabular_permissions widget.  If you have a custom UserAdmin, then set this option to False and make sure you either:  1. Inherit from ``tabular_permissions.admin.TabularPermissionsUserAdmin`` and ``tabular_permissions.admin.TabularPermissionsGroupAdmin`` for User &amp; Group ModelAdmin.  2. Or for a more direct and compact way, inherit your ModelAdmin from ``tabular_permissions.admin.UserTabularPermissionsMixin`` and ``tabular_permissions.admin.GroupTabularPermissionsMixin`` (comes before admin.ModelAdmin in the mro),  3. Set the user_permissions widget to ``tabular_permissions.widgets.TabularPermissionsWidget`` and remember to send a 3rd argument 'permissions' for Group Model Admin.     See ``tabular_permissions.admin`` for information.use_for_concrete  Default: False (new in version 2.8)  There was an inconsistency with proxy models permissions (Django ticket `11154 &lt;https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/11154&gt;`_) which got fixed in Django 2.1  In case you're on an django &lt;2.1 and you have proxy models and you created their permissions by hand (via this `gist &lt;https://gist.github.com/magopian/7543724&gt;`_ maybe), then turn off this option in order to correctly assign your newly created permissions.  For django &gt; 2.1, leave it as is you should be good.custom_permission_translation  A dotted path function to translate the custom permission.  This function gets passed the permissions `codename`, `verbose_name` and its relevant `content_type_id`.  The function will try to translate the permission verbose_name.apps_customization_func  A dotted path function to control the whole permissions objects passed to the widget.  Sometimes you use custom menu where apps and models are ordered in a more &quot;user friendly&quot; manner and not necessarily  in the &quot;actual programmatic&quot; apps &amp; models order.  You can use this option to get a hold of the whole ordered dict and shuffle its content around moving  models from one app to the other and do all kind of crazy stuff to get just the right table of permissions.custom_permissions_customization_func  A dotted path function to control the &quot;extra&quot; permissions which will be displayed on the default django widget.  Suppose a model is removed, or an app is commented out of `INSTALLED_APPS`; its permissions are still in the  permissions table, and it will be picked up.  Use this function to manipulate and order those permissions and return them .  The permissions are passed a list of tuples , like this ``[(perm_id, perm_name), (perm_id, perm_name), ...]``JavaScript:-----------Located at 'static/tabular_permissions/tabular_permissions.js', it have 2 responsibilities:1. Upon form submit, the checked permissions in the table are dynamically appended to the form default permission input so the backend can carry on its functionality normally and correctly.2. Add handlers for column and row `select-all` checkboxes.Compatibility:--------------Version &gt;= 2.0  only supports Django &gt;= 1.11For earlier versions of django use django-tabular-permissions 1.0.9.Screenshots:------------Basic Demo.. image:: https://rasystems.io/static/images/tabular_permissions/tp_1.png    :target: https://rasystems.io/static/images/tabular_permissions/tp_1.png    :alt: Basic demoRTL and localized.. image:: https://rasystems.io/static/images/tabular_permissions/tp_ar.png    :target: https://rasystems.io/static/images/tabular_permissions/tp_ar.png    :alt: RTL and localizedWith Custom permission behaviour.. image:: https://rasystems.io/static/images/tabular_permissions/tp_extra.png    :target: https://rasystems.io/static/images/tabular_permissions/tp_extra.png    :alt: With Custom permission-------Demo:-----To run the demo project in the repo on your local you need1.
