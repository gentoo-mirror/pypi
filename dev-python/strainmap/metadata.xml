These images include magnitude andphase components.The segmentation stage lets the user select the inner and outerwalls of the heart. This needs to be done for all images taken over a heartbeat and foras many slices (cross-sections of the heart) as available. The process can be manual –very long – or assisted by several machine learning technologies such as snakessegmentation or a deep neural network. The segmented heart, together with the phaseinformation can be used in the next stage to extract information of the instantaneous,spatially-resolved velocity of the myocardium during the heartbeat in the form ofvelocity curves ad heatmaps. All this information can be exported for further analysiselsewhere.## Installation### Recommended way The recommended way for end users to access and use the tool is via `pipx`:1. Install and configure [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) following the   instructions appropriate for your operative system. Make sure it works well before   moving on.2. Install StrainMap with `pipx install strainmap`. It might take a   while to complete, but afterwards updates should be pretty fast.3. To run StrainMap just open a terminal and execute `strainmap`. You might want to   create a shortcut for this command in the desktop, for convenience.Whenever there is a new version of StrainMap, just run `pipx upgrade strainmap` andit will be downloaded and installed with no fuss.### Use a StrainMap executableAlternatively, you can download from the [releasepage](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/strainmap/releases) the self-containedexecutable corresponding to the version you are interested in. Bear in mind that theseexecutables contain StrainMap and *all its dependencies*, meaning that each download canbe, potentially, very large.## For developersThis installation instructions assume the following pre-requisites:- Python &gt;=3.8- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) &gt;= 1.11- GitIf these are already installed and the path correctly configured, the following should download the last version of StrainMap, create and activate a virtual environment, install all StrainMap dependencies and, finally, install StrainMap itself in development mode. ```bashgit clone https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/strainmap.gitcd strainmappoetry install```To use StrainMap simply run:```bashpoetry run python -m strainmap```## Related projectsThe following two projects are standalone tools used to collect the data needed to train the AI used by StrainMap and re-train it, when needed. They are separate from StrainMap and are not required for using it. - [AI Trainer](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/strainmap-ai-trainer)- [Files Harvester](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/strainmap-harvester)</longdescription>
