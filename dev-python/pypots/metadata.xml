Although this problem is important, the area of machine learning on POTS still lacks a dedicated toolkit.PyPOTS is created to fill in this blank.‚¶ø `Mission`: PyPOTS (pronounced &quot;Pie Pots&quot;) is born to become a handy toolbox that is going to make machine learning on POTS easy rather thantedious, to help engineers and researchers focus more on the core problems in their hands rather than on how to dealwith the missing parts in their data. PyPOTS will keep integrating classical and the latest state-of-the-art machine learningalgorithms for partially-observed multivariate time series. For sure, besides various algorithms, PyPOTS is going tohave unified APIs together with detailed documentation and interactive examples across algorithms as tutorials.ü§ó **Please** star this repo to help others notice PyPOTS if you think it is a useful toolkit.**Please** properly [cite PyPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS#-citing-pypots) in your publicationsif it helps with your research. This really means a lot to our open-source research. Thank you!The rest of this readme file is organized as follows:[**‚ùñ PyPOTS Ecosystem**](#-pypots-ecosystem),[**‚ùñ Installation**](#-installation),[**‚ùñ Usage**](#-usage),[**‚ùñ Available Algorithms**](#-available-algorithms),[**‚ùñ Citing PyPOTS**](#-citing-pypots),[**‚ùñ Contribution**](#-contribution),[**‚ùñ Community**](#-community).## ‚ùñ PyPOTS EcosystemAt PyPOTS, things are related to coffee, which we're familiar with. Yes, this is a coffee universe!As you can see, there is a coffee pot in the PyPOTS logo.And what else? Please read on ;-)&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WenjieDu/TSDB&quot;&gt;    &lt;img src=&quot;https://pypots.com/figs/pypots_logos/TSDB_logo_FFBG.svg&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; alt=&quot;TSDB logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;üëà Time series datasets are taken as coffee beans at PyPOTS, and POTS datasets are incomplete coffee beans with missing parts that have their own meanings.To make various public time-series datasets readily available to users,&lt;i&gt;Time Series Data Beans (TSDB)&lt;/i&gt; is created to make loading time-series datasets super easy!Visit [TSDB](https://github.com/WenjieDu/TSDB) right now to know more about this handy tool üõ†, and it now supports a total of 168 open-source datasets!&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyGrinder&quot;&gt;    &lt;img src=&quot;https://pypots.com/figs/pypots_logos/PyGrinder_logo_FFBG.svg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; alt=&quot;PyGrinder logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;üëâ To simulate the real-world data beans with missingness, the ecosystem library [PyGrinder](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyGrinder),a toolkit helping grind your coffee beans into incomplete ones, is created. Missing patterns fall into three categories according to Robin's theory[^13]:MCAR (missing completely at random), MAR (missing at random), and MNAR (missing not at random).PyGrinder supports all of them and additional functionalities related to missingness.With PyGrinder, you can introduce synthetic missing values into your datasets with a single line of code.&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WenjieDu/BrewPOTS&quot;&gt;    &lt;img src=&quot;https://pypots.com/figs/pypots_logos/BrewPOTS_logo_FFBG.svg&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;140&quot; alt=&quot;BrewPOTS logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;üëà Now we have the beans, the grinder, and the pot, how to brew us a cup of coffee? Tutorials are necessary!Considering the future workload, PyPOTS tutorials are released in a single repo,and you can find them in [BrewPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/BrewPOTS).Take a look at it now, and learn how to brew your POTS datasets!‚òïÔ∏è Welcome to the universe of PyPOTS. Enjoy it and have fun!## ‚ùñ InstallationYou can refer to [the installation instruction](https://docs.pypots.com/en/latest/install.html) in PyPOTS documentation for a guideline with more details.PyPOTS is available on both [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypots) and [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pypots).You can install PyPOTS as shown below:``` bash# by pippip install pypots            # the first time installationpip install pypots --upgrade  # update pypots to the latest version# by condaconda install -c conda-forge pypots  # the first time installationconda update  -c conda-forge pypots  # update pypots to the latest version````Alternatively, you can install from the latest source code with the latest features but may be not officially released yet:&gt; pip install https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS/archive/main.zip## ‚ùñ UsageBesides [BrewPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/BrewPOTS), you can also find a simple and quick-start tutorial notebookon Google Colab with [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HEFjylEy05-r47jRy0H9jiS_WhD0UWmQ?usp=sharing).If you have further questions, please refer to PyPOTS documentation [docs.pypots.com](https://docs.pypots.com).You can also [raise an issue](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS/issues) or [ask in our community](#-community).We present you a usage example of imputing missing values in time series with PyPOTS below, you can click it to view.&lt;details open&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;Click here to see an example applying SAITS on PhysioNet2012 for imputation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;``` pythonimport numpy as npfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScalerfrom pygrinder import mcar, masked_fillfrom pypots.data import load_specific_datasetfrom pypots.imputation import SAITSfrom pypots.utils.metrics import cal_mae# Data preprocessing.
