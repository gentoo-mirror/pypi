You'll want to do this anytime the dependencieschange (requirements.txt, dev-requirements.txt).    $ make buildStart the containers.    $ make upCKAN will start at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).Start the containers, but don't start ckan. More debugging instructions [here](#Debugging)    $ make debugOpen a shell to run commands in the container.    $ docker-compose exec app bashIf you're unfamiliar with docker-compose, see our[cheatsheet](https://github.com/GSA/datagov-deploy/wiki/Docker-Best-Practices#cheatsheet)and the [official docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/).Clean the containers and remove the data.    $ make cleanFor additional make targets, see the help.    $ make help### TestingThey follow the guidelines for [testing CKAN extensions](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/extensions/testing-extensions.html#testing-extensions).To run the extension tests:    $ make testLint your code.    $ make lint### DebuggingWe have not determined a good way for most IDE native debugging, however you can use the built in Python pdb debugger. Simply run `make debug`, which will run docker with an interactive shell. Add import pdb; pdb.set_trace() anywhere you want to start debugging, and if the code is triggered you should see a command prompt waiting in the shell. Use a pdb cheat sheet when starting to learn like this.When you edit/add/remove code, the server is smart enough to restart. If you are editing logic that is not part of the webserver (ckan command, etc) then you should be able to run the command after edits and get the same debugger prompt.1. Launch the containers with `make debug`2. Start the CKAN process by running `./start_ckan_development.sh`3. Add `import ibdb; ipdb.set_trace()` at the point you wish to debug.4. Invoke that code to hit that breakpoint.</longdescription>
