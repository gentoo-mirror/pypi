	<longdescription>Patches to enhance EFB functionality==========================[![PyPI release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/efb-patch-middleware.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/efb-patch-middleware/)[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/efb-patch-middleware/month)](https://pypi.org/project/efb-patch-middleware/)### Main Function- Telegram administrator can send messages- Automatically mark read on WeChat (**received messages on telegram** will mark read)- In a group, only one note is displayed when the note has the same name (or one is included by the other)- ~~/update_info command adds WeChat group member information to telegram group description~~ (supported)- Establish a database to save the tg group and WeChat chat/group name mapping. When there is no binding, try to find a group with the same name and automatically bind (two-way)- Delete unnecessary messages when receiving pictures, videos, files, for example: sent a picture. &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;- Applet sharing adds &quot;Applet:&quot; title prefix to distinguish regular links- Use &lt;code&gt;rm`&lt;/code&gt; to reply to the message sent by yourself (telegram message cannot be edited )### compatible version```textEFB 2.1.0ETM 2.2.4EWS 2.0.4```### UsageThe `/update_info` command will bind the current group to the WeChat chat one-to-one correspondence  The `/relate_group` command binds the WeChat group to the current telegram group, and can be associated with multiple WeChat chats; repeated use will clear the previous binding relationship  The `/release_group` command will delete all WeChat sessions bound to the telegram group  Add the following configuration under `blueset.telegram/config.yaml`, and send the public account message to the `-12334557` group (view the id through the `/info` command)```yamltg_mp: -12334557 # telegram group id```### Configfile path `~/.ehforwarderbot/profiles/default/patch.PatchMiddleware/config.yaml`  ```yamlauto_mark_as_read: True # auto mark as read in wechat phone clientremove_emoji_in_title: True # wouldn't remove emoji in telegram group title if this is set Falsestrikethrough_recall_msg: True # strikethrough instead of replying to a recall message```### Installation```bashpip3 install efb-patch-middleware````~/.ehforwarderbot/profiles/default/config.yaml` file add to configuration enable middleware```yamlmaster_channel: blueset.telegramslave_channels:- blueset.wechatmiddlewares:- patch.PatchMiddleware```### Data BackupData is saved under `.ehforwarderbot/profiles/default/patch.PatchMiddleware/tg_group.db`### Difference between `/update_info` and `/relate_group`  `/update_info` is the original command of efb, which will update the WeChat session avatar and name to the tg group, and only supports binding a WeChat session. Now this command has been extended to synchronize the WeChat session name with the tg group ID. Binding one-to-one correspondence. After the link fails, replace the original failed link with the latest one`/relate_group` is a new command for middleware. The application scenario is that tg group is used when binding multiple WeChat sessions. (Usually when multiple public accounts are bound to a tg group.) **A message needs to be answered when used**&gt; [1]: Forward picture-type messages received by WeChat end usually with author name, remove picture title when forwarding such messages</longdescription>
