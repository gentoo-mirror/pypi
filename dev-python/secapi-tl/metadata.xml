	<longdescription># secapiThis module provides a set of functions that can be used to query company submissions from the sec. As well as some utility functions that can be used to get sec related information about companies.## Technical informationThe module was developed with python 2.7.18 and only uses build-in python packages as wellas the packages typing, requests, ratelimiter and [OpenDateRange](https://github.com/tlie03/OpenDateRange).## Installation``$ pip install secapi-tl``## core functions### sec_requestThe sec_request method is used to make requests to the sec.It has a rate limit mechanism implemented that ensures that the amount of requests stays in the boundaries set by the sec. All methods from this moduleuse this method internally for their requests. Thereby your own requests tothe sec will be compatible if you use this method. Furthermore, the sec_request method will automaticallycreate a header with a valid User-Agent. You can also pass your own header to the method.If this header does not contain a User-Agent, the method will add a valid User-Agent to the header.```pythonfrom secapi_tl import sec_requestraw_data = sec_request(url=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019323000070/xslF345X04/wf-form4_168444912415136.xml&quot;)```### get_submissionsThe get_submissions function queries company submissions via the data.sec.gov/submissions/ endpoint as recommended [here](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/sec-api-documentation).The method takes parameters that can be used to filter the queried submissions.A query accepts the following parameters:- ticker_symbol_or_cik: The ticker symbol or cik of the company you want to query submissions for.Takes lowercase and uppercase letters for ticker symbols. Ciks must be passed as strings but leading zeros are not required.- start_date: Only submissions that have been published at or after this date will be queried.The date must be passed as a string of format YYYY-MM-DD.- end_date: Only submissions that have been published at or before this date will be queried.The date must be passed as a string of format YYYY-MM-DD.- form_type: Only submissions that have one of the specified form types will be queried.You can pass a form type as a string or a list of form types as a list of strings.The method returns a list of Submission objects. Each submission object holdsthe data for one submission. The data can be accessed via properties of the object.```pythonfrom secapi_tl import get_submissions# query form 4 submissions for apple in january 2021submissions = get_submissions(    ticker_symbol_or_cik=&quot;AAPL&quot;,    start_date=&quot;2021-01-01&quot;,    end_date=&quot;2021-01-31&quot;,    form_type=&quot;4&quot;)```!!! WARNING !!! Since the data.sec.gov/submissions/ endpoint is constantly under ahigh load, it can happen that a TooManyRequestsError is raised. Since the methoddoes use the sec_request method there is no violation of the rate limit. Requeststo other endpoints will therefore still work. The occurrence of this error ishighly dependent on the usage of this method. So you might need to implementa mechanism that handles this error depending on your use case. The TooManyRequestserror is part of this module and can be imported from the module.```pythonfrom secapi_tl import TooManyRequestsError```## utility functionsMost of the utility functions are based on the [company tickers file](https://www.sec.gov/files/company_tickers.json).They use this file for transitions between cik and ticker symbol or toproof if a ticker symbol is registered at the sec or not.### is_registeredThis method takes a ticker symbol and returns True if the ticker symbol is registeredat the sec and False if it is not registered. If the method returns True the ticker symbolcan be used with all other methods of this module. The ticker symbol can be uppercase andlowercase. The method will automatically convert the ticker symbol to uppercase letters.```pythonfrom secapi_tl import is_registeredis_registered(&quot;AAPL&quot;) # Trueis_registered(&quot;aapl&quot;) # Trueis_registered(&quot;AAP&quot;) # False```### ticker_to_cikThis method takes a ticker symbol and returns the cik of the company to which the ticker symbol belongs.If the ticker symbol is not found a ValueError is raised.The ticker symbol can be uppercase and lowercase. The method will automatically convert the ticker symbol to uppercase letters.```python   from secapi_tl import ticker_to_cikticker_to_cik(&quot;AAPL&quot;) # &quot;320193&quot;```### filter_tickers_registeredTakes a list of ticker symbols and returns a list of those ticker symbols thatare found to be registered at the sec. The ticker symbols can be uppercase and lowercase.The returned ticker symbols are uppercase.```pythonfrom secapi_tl import filter_tickers_registeredfilter_tickers_registered([&quot;AAPL&quot;, &quot;TSLA&quot;, &quot;AAP&quot;]) # [&quot;AAPL&quot;, &quot;TSLA&quot;]```This method is useful if you want to query submissions for a list of companiesand you dont know if all of the companies are registered at the sec.All the returned ticker symbols will work with the get_submissions method.### get_registered_tickersReturns a list of all ticker symbols that are found in the [company tickers file](https://www.sec.gov/files/company_tickers.json).### get_registered_ciksReturns a list of all ciks that are found in the [company tickers file](https://www.sec.gov/files/company_tickers.json).</longdescription>
