	<longdescription># langchain-contribA collection of utilities that are too experimental for [langchain proper](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), but are nonetheless generic enough to potentially be useful for multiple projects. Currently consists of code dumped from [ZAMM](https://github.com/amosjyng/zamm), but is of course open to contributions with lax procedures.## Quickstart```bashpip install langchain-contrib```To add interop with [`vcr-langchain`](https://github.com/amosjyng/vcr-langchain), simply install it as well:```bashpip install vcr-langchain```</longdescription>
