	<longdescription># drukarnia-api[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/androu-sys/drukarnia-api/blob/main/LICENSE)## Overview`drukarnia-api` is a Python library designed as a wrapper for the ***Drukarnia API***, providing various functionalities for interacting with the Drukarnia platform. It simplifies the process of accessing and manipulating data from the Drukarnia API, enabling users to seamlessly integrate Drukarnia's features into their applications. The library is actively being developed and already includes almost all of the necessary features. We are working diligently to implement the remaining features as quickly as possible.## Simple Usage```pythonfrom drukarnia_api import Searchasync def get_author_article_titles():    async with Search() as search_engine:        authors = await search_engine.find_author('cupomanka')         # Get the first search result        author = authors[0]        # Collect all data about the user        await author.collect_data()        # Get user articles        articles = await author.articles        # Print all titles        for article in articles:            print(article.title)if __name__ == '__main__':    import asyncio    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()    loop.run_until_complete(get_author_article_titles())```## InstallationYou can install `drukarnia-api` using pip:```bashpip install drukarnia-api```## ContributingContributions to `drukarnia-api` are welcome!
