These comes default with the user that created the Snowflake account.- The password for your SYSADMIN user.Run the following command to get started with the interactive CLI.Note - the CLI will print the SQL queries it is planning to run and confirm with you before it makes any changes.```bashpoetry run target-snowflake --initialize# Alternatively using Meltano CLImeltano invoke target-snowflake --initialize```The CLI also has a &quot;dry run&quot; mode that will print the queries without executing them.Check out the demo of this [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/9vEFxw-0nxI).### Configure using environment variablesThis Singer target will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory's`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matchingenvironment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.## UsageYou can easily run `target-snowflake` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).### Executing the Target Directly```bashtarget-snowflake --versiontarget-snowflake --help# Test using the &quot;Carbon Intensity&quot; sample:tap-carbon-intensity | target-snowflake --config /path/to/target-snowflake-config.json```## Developer Resources### Initialize your Development Environment```bashpipx install poetrypoetry install```### Create and Run TestsCreate tests within the `target_snowflake/tests` subfolder and  then run:```bashpoetry run pytest```You can also test the `target-snowflake` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:```bashpoetry run target-snowflake --help```### Testing with [Meltano](https://meltano.com/)_**Note:** This target will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created.Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:```bash# Install meltanopipx install meltano# Initialize meltano within this directorycd target-snowflakemeltano install```Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:```bash# Test invocation:meltano invoke target-snowflake --version# OR run a test `elt` pipeline with the Carbon Intensity sample tap:meltano run tap-carbon-intensity target-snowflake```### SDK Dev GuideSee the [dev guide](https://sdk.meltano.com/en/latest/dev_guide.html) for more instructions on how to use the Meltano SDK todevelop your own Singer taps and targets.</longdescription>
