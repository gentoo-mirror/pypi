We do expect users to define this variable within their own CI jobdefinitions. The number of tests executed is likely to be dependent on the CIjob.We discourage defining this inside places like `tox.ini` because when adeveloper runs tests, they are likely to endup running a different number oftests. Also, this feature makes no sense if you try to mention a specific test.## Avoiding duplicate test function namesWhile pytest allows users to have the same test function names in differentfiles, that makes it harder to identify and copy/paste the test name in orderto reproduce the failure locally. That is why this plugin forces its users toavoid having the same function name anywhere in the tested project.You can disable this check by defining `PYTEST_CHECK_TEST_DUPLICATE=0`.## Avoiding problematic test identifiersThis plugin will raise errors when it encounters test IDs that are either toolong or that contain unsafe characters. While pytest is very flexible in allowinga wide range of test IDs, using these does make development harder as it preventspeople from doing a copy/paste with failed test and pasting in in their terminalto reproduce the failed test locally.You can disable regex check by defining `PYTEST_CHECK_TEST_ID_REGEX=0`.You can disable the length check by defining `PYTEST_MAX_TEST_ID_LENGTH=0`.## Release processReleases are triggered from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-plus/releases)page.## Links- [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)- [file an issue](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-plus/issues)- [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)- [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)- [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project)</longdescription>
