	<longdescription># CameraHub TaggerCameraHub Tagger is a companion command-line app for [CameraHub](https://camerahub.info/) to tag JPGscans of negatives with EXIF metadata from the CameraHub API. This means you can organise your filmscans in a digital photo management app with full metadata.To use CameraHub Tagger, you must already have entered your cameras, lenses, films and negatives into CameraHub. When you scan your negatives, name them consistently like `{FILM}-{FRAME}-IMG0001.jpg` (for example `45-12-IMG0001.jpg` is frame 12 on film 45).Run CameraHub Tagger in the same directory. CameraHub Tagger will attempt to match the JPGs with thenegatives by using the filename (it will ask you if it can't figure it out). It will then generate aunique ID for that scanned JPG to tie it conclusively to the negative. Once the link is made, CameraHubTagger will retrieve all data about that negative, film, lens and camera and use it to generate EXIFmetadata, the same as digital cameras do. It is safe to run CameraHub Tagger multiple times on the samefiles, as only changed tags are written.When your images have been tagged, any digital photo app will read and display these tags in the sameway as digital photos.## InstallationInstall from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/camerahub-tagger/) with Pip:```consolepip install camerahub-tagger```This installs a `tagger` binary in your `$PATH`.## Usage```consoletagger [-h] [-r] [-a] [-y] [-d] [-f FILE] [-p PROFILE]```### `-h --help`Display help message and exit### `-r --recursive`Search for scans recursively from current directory### `-a --auto`Don't prompt user to identify scans, only guess based on filename### `-y --yes`Accept all changes without confirmation### `-d --dry-run`Don't write any tags to image files### `-d --update-only`Only update tags which have previously been written. Don't make any new Scan records in CameraHub.### `-f --file FILE`Image file to be tagged. If not supplied, tag everything in the current directory.### `-p --profile PROFILE`CameraHub connection profile. Default: `prod`.### `-c --clear`Clear existing EXIF metadata from the image file.## ConfigCameraHub Tagger needs some basic connection details to connect to CameraHub.On first run, it will ask for credentials for CameraHub and save them for future use.If you need multiple profiles (e.g. if you have multiple users, or you need to connect toa development instance of CameraHub) you can configure the extra profiles manually by editing`~/camerahub.ini` and adding more blocks.The names of each profile are arbitrary, but CameraHub Tagger will automatically use the `prod` profileunless you override it with the `--profile` option. Here's an example:```ini[prod]server = https://camerahub.info/apiusername = anseladamspassword = yosemite[dev]server = https://dev.camerahub.info/apiusername = annieleibovitzpassword = johnandyoko[local]server = http://127.0.0.1:8000/apiusername = adminpassword = admin```</longdescription>
