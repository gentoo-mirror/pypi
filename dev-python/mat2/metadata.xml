Office documents like PDF or Office automatically addsauthor and company information to documents and spreadsheets.Maybe you don't want to disclose those information.This is precisely the job of mat2: getting rid, as much as possible, ofmetadata.mat2 provides:- a library called `libmat2`;- a command line tool called `mat2`,- a service menu for Dolphin, KDE's default file managerIf you prefer a regular graphical user interface, you might be interested in[Metadata Cleaner](https://metadatacleaner.romainvigier.fr/), which is using`mat2` under the hood.# Requirements- `python3-mutagen` for audio support- `python3-gi-cairo` and `gir1.2-poppler-0.18` for PDF support- `gir1.2-gdkpixbuf-2.0` for images support- `gir1.2-rsvg-2.0` for svg support- `FFmpeg`, optionally, for video support- `libimage-exiftool-perl` for everything else- `bubblewrap`, optionally, for sandboxingPlease note that mat2 requires at least Python3.5.# Requirements setup on macOS (OS X) using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)```bashbrew install exiftool cairo pygobject3 poppler gdk-pixbuf librsvg ffmpeg```# Running the test suite```bash$ python3 -m unittest discover -v```And if you want to see the coverage:```bash$ python3-coverage run --branch -m unittest discover -s tests/$ python3-coverage report --include -m --include /libmat2/*'```# How to use mat2```usage: mat2 [-h] [-V] [--unknown-members policy] [--inplace] [--no-sandbox]            [-v] [-l] [--check-dependencies] [-L | -s]            [files [files ...]]Metadata anonymisation toolkit 2positional arguments:  files                 the files to processoptional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -V, --verbose         show more verbose status information  --unknown-members policy                        how to handle unknown members of archive-style files                        (policy should be one of: abort, omit, keep) [Default:                        abort]  --inplace             clean in place, without backup  --no-sandbox          Disable bubblewrap's sandboxing  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit  -l, --list            list all supported fileformats  --check-dependencies  check if mat2 has all the dependencies it needs  -L, --lightweight     remove SOME metadata  -s, --show            list harmful metadata detectable by mat2 without                        removing them```Note that mat2 **will not** clean files in-place, but will produce, forexample, with a file named &quot;myfile.png&quot; a cleaned version named&quot;myfile.cleaned.png&quot;.## Web interfaceIt's possible to run mat2 as a web service, via[mat2-web](https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2-web).## Desktop GUIFor GNU/Linux desktops, it's possible to use the[Metadata Cleaner](https://gitlab.com/rmnvgr/metadata-cleaner) GTK application.# Supported formatsThe following formats are supported: avi, bmp, css, epub/ncx, flac, gif, jpeg,m4a/mp2/mp3/…, mp4, odc/odf/odg/odi/odp/ods/odt/…, off/opus/oga/spx/…, pdf,png, ppm, pptx/xlsx/docx/…, svg/svgz/…, tar/tar.gz/tar.bz2/tar.xz/…, tiff,torrent, wav, wmv, zip, …  # Notes about detecting metadataWhile mat2 is doing its very best to display metadata when the `--show` flag ispassed, it doesn't mean that a file is clean from any metadata if mat2 doesn'tshow any. There is no reliable way to detect every single possible metadata forcomplex file formats.This is why you shouldn't rely on metadata's presence to decide if your file mustbe cleaned or not.# Notes about the lightweight modeBy default, mat2 might alter a bit the data of your files, in order to removeas much metadata as possible. For example, texts in PDF might not be selectable anymore,compressed images might get compressed again, …Since some users might be willing to trade some metadata's presence in exchangeof the guarantee that mat2 won't modify the data of their files, there is the`-L` flag that precisely does that.# Related software- The first iteration of [MAT](https://mat.boum.org)- [Exiftool](https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/mat)- [pdf-redact-tools](https://github.com/firstlookmedia/pdf-redact-tools), thattries to deal with *printer dots* too.- [pdfparanoia](https://github.com/kanzure/pdfparanoia), that removeswatermarks from PDF.- [Scrambled Exif](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.jarsilio.android.scrambledeggsif/),an open-source Android application to remove metadata from pictures.- [Dangerzone](https://dangerzone.rocks/), designed to sanitize harmful documents  into harmless ones.# ContactIf possible, use the [issues system](https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2/issues)or the [mailing list](https://www.autistici.org/mailman/listinfo/mat-dev)Should a more private contact be needed (eg. for reporting security issues),you can email Julien (jvoisin) Voisin at `julien.voisin+mat2@dustri.org`,using the gpg key `9FCDEE9E1A381F311EA62A7404D041E8171901CC`.# DonationsIf you want to donate some money, please give it to [Tails]( https://tails.boum.org/donate/?r=contribute ).# LicenseThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modifyit under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or(at your option) any later version.This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty ofMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
