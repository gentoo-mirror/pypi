	<longdescription># Crosslingual CoreferenceCoreference is amazing but the data required for training a model is very scarce. In our case, the available training for non-English languages also proved to be poorly annotated. Crosslingual Coreference, therefore, uses the assumption a trained model with English data and cross-lingual embeddings should work for languages with similar sentence structures.[![Current Release Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/pandora-intelligence/crosslingual-coreference.svg?style=flat-square&amp;logo=github)](https://github.com/pandora-intelligence/crosslingual-coreference/releases)[![pypi Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/crosslingual-coreference.svg?style=flat-square&amp;logo=pypi&amp;logoColor=white)](https://pypi.org/project/crosslingual-coreference/)[![PyPi downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/crosslingual-coreference?period=total&amp;units=international_system&amp;left_color=grey&amp;right_color=orange&amp;left_text=pip%20downloads)](https://pypi.org/project/crosslingual-coreference/)[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/ambv/black)# Install```pip install crosslingual-coreference```# Quickstart```pythonfrom crosslingual_coreference import Predictortext = (    &quot;Do not forget about Momofuku Ando!
