It works with Pythonversions 3.6+.The [Seven Bridges Platform](https://www.sbgenomics.com/) is acloud-based environment for conducting bioinformatic analyses. It is acentral hub for teams to store, analyze, and jointly interpret theirbioinformatic data. The Platform co-locates analysis pipelines alongsidethe largest genomic datasets to optimize processing, allocating storageand compute resources on demand.The [The Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC)](http://www.cancergenomicscloud.org/), powered by[Seven Bridges](https://www.sbgenomics.com/), is also a cloud-based computationenvironment. It was built as one of three pilot systems funded by the[National Cancer Institute](http://www.cancer.gov/) to explore theparadigm of colocalizing massive genomics datasets, like The[Cancer Genomics Atlas (TCGA)](http://cancergenome.nih.gov/), alongside secureand scalable computational resources to analyze them. The CGC makes morethan a petabyte of multi-dimensional data available immediately toauthorized researchers. You can add your own data to analyze alongsideTCGA using predefined analytical workflows or your own tools.The [Cavatica](http://www.cavatica.org/),powered by [Seven Bridges](https://www.sbgenomics.com/), is a data analysis and sharingplatform designed to accelerate discovery in a scalable, cloud-basedcompute environment where data, results, and workflows are shared amongthe world's research community. Cavatica is built in collaboration withthe Children Hospital of Philadelphia and it is focused on pediatricdata.Documentation-------------The latest documentation can be found on [readthedocs](http://sevenbridges-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest).Installation------------The easiest way to install sevenbridges-python is using pip:    $ pip install sevenbridges-pythonGet the Code------------sevenbridges-python is actively developed on GitHub, where the code isalways available.The easiest way to obtain the source is to clone the public repository :    $ git clone git://github.com/sbg/sevenbridges-python.gitOnce you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your Pythonpackage, or install it into your site-packages by invoking: :    $ python setup.py installIf you are interested in reviewing this documentation locally, clonethis repository, position yourself in the docs directory and afterinstalling `requirements-dev.txt`, invoke:    $ make htmlRun Tests---------In order to run tests clone this repository, position yourself in theroot of the cloned project and after installing `requirements-dev.txt`, invoke:    $ pytestAuthentication and Configuration--------------------------------In order to authenticate with the API, you should pass the followingitems to sevenbridges-python:(a) Your authentication token(b) The API endpoint you will be interacting with. This is either the    endpoint for the Seven Bridges Platform or for the Seven Bridges    Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC) or for CAVATICA.You can find your authentication token on the respective pages:- &lt;https://igor.sbgenomics.com/developer&gt; for the Seven Bridges Platform- &lt;https://cgc.sbgenomics.com/developer&gt; for the CGC- &lt;https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com/developer&gt; for CavaticaThe API endpoints for each environment are:- &lt;https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2&gt; for the Seven Bridges Platform- &lt;https://cgc-api.sbgenomics.com/v2&gt; for the CGC.- &lt;https://cavatica-api.sbgenomics.com/v2&gt; for CAVATICAFor more information about the API, including details of the availableparameters for each API call, you should check the API documentationbefore using this library:- &lt;http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/the-api&gt; for the Seven Bridges Platform.- &lt;http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/the-cgc-api&gt; for the CGC.- &lt;http://docs.cavatica.org/docs/the-api&gt; for CAVATICAInitialize configuration using the configuration file-----------------------------------------------------Once you obtain your authentication token, you can pass it to the Configobject. You can instantiate the API object by passing the appropriateconfiguration. There are three ways you can pass configure the library:1.  Pass parameters `url` and `token` explicitly when initializing the    config object.2.  Put the API endpoint and token in the environment variables    `API_URL` and `AUTH_TOKEN` respectively.3.  Use the configuration file `$HOME/.sevenbridges/credentials` with    defined parameters.### Explicit initialization```pythonimport sevenbridges as sbgapi = sbg.Api(url='https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2', token='&lt;TOKEN_HERE&gt;')```### Initialization via environment variables```pythonimport osimport sevenbridges as sbg# Usually these would be set in the shell beforehandos.environ['SB_API_ENDPOINT'] = 'https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2'os.environ['SB_AUTH_TOKEN'] = '&lt;TOKEN_HERE&gt;'api = sbg.Api()```### Initialization via config file```pythonimport sevenbridges as sbgconfig = sbg.Config(profile='cgc')api = sbg.Api(config=config)```### Notes on config file formatThe `$HOME/.sevenbridges/credentials` file has a simple .ini fileformat, for example:    [default]    api_endpoint = https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2    auth_token = &lt;TOKEN_HERE&gt;    [cgc]    api_endpoint = https://cgc-api.sbgenomics.com/v2    auth_token = &lt;TOKEN_HERE&gt;    [cavatica]    api_endpoint = https://cavatica-api.sbgenomics.com/v2    auth_token = &lt;TOKEN_HERE&gt;#### Initializing the sevenbridges-python libraryThe API object represents the central resource for querying, saving andperforming all other actions on your resources. Once you haveinstantiated the configuration class, pass it to the API classconstructor.```pythonimport sevenbridges as sbgapi_config = sbg.Config()  # Or any other choice of initialization methodapi = sbg.Api(config=api_config)```Examples--------The following code illustrates the way the library should be used. Formore detailed examples consult the documentation, hosted on readthedocs.```pythonimport sevenbridges as sbgapi_config = sbg.Config()  # Or any other choice of initialization methodapi = sbg.Api(config=api_config)# Get current useruser = api.users.me()# Query your projectsprojects = api.projects.query(limit=100)# Fetch project filesproject = projects[0]files = project.get_files()```Contributing------------Contributions, bug reports and issues are very welcome.You can make your own contributions by forking the develop branch ofthis repository, making your changes, and issuing pull request on thedevelop branch.
