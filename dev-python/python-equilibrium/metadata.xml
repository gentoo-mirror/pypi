	<longdescription># equilibrium&gt; __Equilibrium__ _(noun)_: A state in which opposing forces or influences are balanced, resulting in a stable system&gt; that does not undergo significant changes. In a broader sense, equilibrium can refer to a state of mental or emotional&gt; balance, as well as the balance of forces in physical or chemical systems.Equilibrium is a framework for implementing control loops and is heavily Kubernets-inspired. A control loop is asystem that continuously monitors the state of a system and takes action to bring the system into a desired state.It is designed to be extensible and flexible, allowing you to implement control loops that are tailored to yourspecific use case.__Installation__Equilibrium is available on PyPI. You need at least Python 3.10.```bashpip install python-equilibrium```__Example__Check out the [examples/local_file/](examples/local_file/) directory for a simple example of a control loop thatmonitors a local file and takes action when the file is modified.```mermaidgraph LR  subgraph Equilibrium    LocalFile[&quot;Resource[LocalFile]&quot;] --&gt; LocalFileController  end  subgraph &quot;Local filesystem&quot;    LocalFileController --&gt; LocalFileModification[&quot;Local filesystem changes&quot;]  end  subgraph &quot;State Backend&quot;    LocalFileController --&gt; State[&quot;Last known state&quot;]  end```__Difference to Kubernetes resources__* Equilibrium does not currently support any key other than `spec` next to `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata` in  a resource definition. This means Equilibrium cannot be used to deserialize actual Kubernetes `Secret` of `Config`  resources.</longdescription>
