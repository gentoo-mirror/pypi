Added a new method to the `system` class, `copy_configuration`, that creates a copy of  the configuration using the same atomset and bonset, but new coordinates and cell so  that any changes to coordinates and cell are not shared between the configurations. By  default it copies the current configuration.2022.11.18 -- Fixed bug with handling for Open Babel  The total charge and multiplicity were not correctly set when creating an Open Babel  molecule.2022.11.3 -- Add handling of strain and improved handling of properties  Added methods for straining the unit cell, and also straining a configuration,  correctly handling the coordinates for an affine transformation. In the future will  add e.g. affine transformation of the centers of molecules, which is useful for  molecular fluids.  Added the system for properties, in addition to the configuration. This allows system  properties that are not associated with a particular configuration, which is often  appropriate for experimental results. It also makes it much easier to search for  systems where any configuration has a particular property.2022.10.26 -- Improved database write performance.  Switched to write-ahead mode and tweaked memory settings. This gives a large  performance improvement (10x or more) for large database (~1 GB).</longdescription>
