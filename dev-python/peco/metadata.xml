It will show up as `4.999999` instead. Make sure to take this into account when using the API.The counties that are available are:- BUCKS- CHESTER- DELAWARE- MONTGOMERY- PHILADELPHIA- YORKThe values you can access are:- customers_out- percent_customers_out- outage_count- customers_served</longdescription>
