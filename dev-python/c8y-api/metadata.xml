	<longdescription>![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-python-api)![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-python-api)![GitHub Release Date](https://img.shields.io/github/release-date/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-python-api)# cumulocity-python-apiThis project is a Python client for the Cumulocity REST API to make it easier to develop programs, scripts, device agents or microservices in Python.## Installation### PrerequisitesBefore installing the module (or any module for that matter) consider creatinga virtual environment for your project. This is generally preferred over installing modules and dependencies globally:```shellcd &lt;project-root&gt;python3 -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activate``` ### Installation from PyPIThe recommended way is to install the lastest distribution package directly from the Python Package Index (PyPI).You can either add _c8y_api_ as a dependency to your project using _setup.cfg_, or install it manually:```shellpip install c8y_api```### Installation using pipReleases are also archived within the GitHub releases page. The module is released as standard Python wheel (_.whl_ file).It can be ownloaded and installed using pip using the following command:```shellpip install &lt;release wheel file&gt;```Like installing from PyPI, this will install all necessary dependencies automatically.  For yourreference, the module's dependencies are also listed in file _requirements.txt_. ### Manual installationAlternatively, you can clone the repository. The module sources can be used directly within your Python 3 project.Simply copy the _c8y_api_ folder to your sources root and install the requirements by running the following command:```shellpip3 install -r requirements.txt```The _requirements.txt_ file is part of the sources.If the _c8y_api_ folder is in your sources root folder all imports shouldwork right away. Alternatively you can add _c8y_api_ to your _PYHTONPATH_:```shellexport PYTHONPATH=&lt;project-root&gt;/c8y_api; $PYTHONPATH```## LicensingThis project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license - see &lt;https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&gt;______________________These tools are provided as-is and without warranty or support.
