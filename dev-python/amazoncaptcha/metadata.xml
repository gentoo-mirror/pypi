	<longdescription>The motivation behind the creation of this library is taking its start from the genuinely simple idea: &quot;**I don't want to use pytesseract or some other non-amazon-specific OCR services, nor do I want to install some executables to just solve a captcha. I desire to get a solution with 2 lines of code without any heavy add-ons, using a pure Python.**&quot;---Pure Python, lightweight, [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)-based solver for [Amazon's text captcha](https://www.amazon.com/errors/validateCaptcha).[![Accuracy](https://img.shields.io/badge/success%20rate-99.9%25-success)](https://github.com/a-maliarov/amazoncaptcha/blob/master/ext/accuracy.log)![Timing](https://img.shields.io/badge/response%20time-0.2s-success)[![Size](https://img.shields.io/badge/wheel%20size-0.9%20MB-informational)](https://pypi.org/project/amazoncaptcha/)[![Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/amazoncaptcha?color=informational)](https://pypi.org/project/amazoncaptcha/)[![Python version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7%2B-informational)](https://pypi.org/project/amazoncaptcha/)[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/amazoncaptcha?color=success)](https://pypi.org/project/amazoncaptcha/)## Recent News+ *May 5, 2023*: tested and approved compatibility with Pillow 9.5.0+ *January 25, 2022*: tested and approved compatibility with Python 3.10+ *January 25, 2022*: dropped support for Python 3.6## InstallationYou can simply install the library from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/amazoncaptcha/) using **pip**. For more methods check the [docs](https://amazoncaptcha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).```bashpip install amazoncaptcha```## Quick SnippetAn example of the constructor usage. Scroll a bit down to see some tasty class methods. **For consistency across different devices, it is highly recommended to use `fromlink` class method**.```pythonfrom amazoncaptcha import AmazonCaptchacaptcha = AmazonCaptcha('captcha.jpg')solution = captcha.solve()# Or: solution = AmazonCaptcha('captcha.jpg').solve()```## Status[![Status](https://img.shields.io/pypi/status/amazoncaptcha)](https://pypi.org/project/amazoncaptcha/)[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/circleci/build/github/a-maliarov/amazoncaptcha)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/a-maliarov/amazoncaptcha)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/amazoncaptcha/badge/?version=latest)](https://amazoncaptcha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)[![Code Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/gh/a-maliarov/amazoncaptcha?label=code%20coverage)](https://codecov.io/gh/a-maliarov/amazoncaptcha)[![CodeFactor Grade](https://img.shields.io/codefactor/grade/github/a-maliarov/amazoncaptcha/master)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/a-maliarov/amazoncaptcha/overview/master)## Usage and Class MethodsBrowsing Amazon using `selenium` and stuck on captcha? The class method below will do all the dirty work of extracting an image from the webpage for you. Practically, it takes a screenshot from your webdriver, crops the captcha and stores it into bytes array which is then used to create an `AmazonCaptcha` instance. This also means avoiding any local savings. **For consistency across different devices, it is highly recommended to use `fromlink` class method instead of `fromdriver`**.```pythonfrom amazoncaptcha import AmazonCaptchafrom selenium import webdriverdriver = webdriver.Chrome() # This is a simplified exampledriver.get('https://www.amazon.com/errors/validateCaptcha')captcha = AmazonCaptcha.fromdriver(driver)solution = captcha.solve()```If you are not using `selenium` or the previous method is not just the case for you, it is possible to use a captcha link directly. This class method will request the url, check the content type and store the response content into bytes array to create an instance of `AmazonCaptcha`.```pythonfrom amazoncaptcha import AmazonCaptchalink = 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/captcha/usvmgloq/Captcha_kwrrnqwkph.jpg'captcha = AmazonCaptcha.fromlink(link)solution = captcha.solve()```In addition, if you are a machine learning or neural network developer and are looking for some training data, check [this](https://github.com/a-maliarov/amazon-captcha-database) repository, which was created to store images and other non-script data for the solver.## Help the DevelopmentIf you are willing to help the development, consider setting `keep_logs` argument of the `solve` method to `True`. Here is the example, if you are using `fromdriver` class method. If set to `True`, all the links of the unsolved captcha will be stored so that later you can [open the issue and send the logs](https://github.com/a-maliarov/amazoncaptcha/issues/new?assignees=a-maliarov&amp;labels=training+data&amp;template=send_logs.md&amp;title=Add+training+data).```pythonfrom amazoncaptcha import AmazonCaptchafrom selenium import webdriverdriver = webdriver.Chrome() # This is a simplified exampledriver.get('https://www.amazon.com/errors/validateCaptcha')captcha = AmazonCaptcha.fromdriver(driver)solution = captcha.solve(keep_logs=True)```If you have any suggestions or ideas of additional instances and methods, which you would like to see in this library, please, feel free to contact the owner via email or fork'n'pull to repository.
