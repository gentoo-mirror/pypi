Each contributor maintains copyrightover their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that thesecontributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the IPythonsource code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person orinstitution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire IPythonDevelopment Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of whatchanges/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicatetheir copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit thechange to one of the IPython repositories.With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code fileto indicate the copyright and license terms:```# Copyright (c) IPython Development Team.# Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.```</longdescription>
