What if your schedule is Monday, Thursday, Saturday?  This library calls that 3 day work schedule &quot;service days&quot;; as in, there are 3  &quot;service days&quot; in a given week.    It will calculate the number of service days between two dates given a service schedule.`service-days` is a library that will calculate the number of service days between two dates### Tools **Add Days**  Given a date and a service schedule, add `x` number of days to get to the next service day.  **Days in Period**  Given a start date and an end date, calculate the number of service days in that period.**Convert JSON formatted text list, to list of days**  Given a JSON formatted list of days, convert it to a list of days.e.g. ```'[&quot;Mon&quot;, &quot;Tue&quot;]'```## Explanation / Usage  This is a quick explanation, may not be 100% accurate.  See the tests for more examples,and examples of how the methods are used.![Service Days](docs/assets/Service-Days-info.png) ## Installation```consolepip install service-days```## License`service-days` is distributed under the terms of the [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) license.## Miscellany### Logging Uses standard Python logging, with the name `servicedays`To make quiet in your code do the following ```python         s_logger = logging.getLogger('servicedays')        s_logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)```### Hatch This is my first attempt at using [hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) to manage a Python project. I'm not sure if I'm doing it right, but I'm trying. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. Thanks!</longdescription>
