Epidemic processes arevery important in both network science and its applications. The mostcommon application is to study the ways in which diseases progress indifferent network conditions, depending on their infectiousness andother properties, but ``epydemic`` can be used to study any networkprocesses of interest.``epydemic`` provides simulation under synchronous and stochastic(Gillespie) dynamics, using the well-known ``networkx`` package torepresent and manipulate networks. It supports a generic model forcompartmented models of disease with several standard models providedand which can be extended to other, more complex, diseases. It alsosupports other network processes such as addition-deletion networksand pulse-coupled synchronisation, generators for several differentensembles of random networks, and a library for handling generatingfunctions used in network analysis.``epydemic`` is built on top of the ``epyc`` experiment managementlibrary, allowing simulations to be conducted at scale on individualmachines, multicore machines, and parallel computing clusters.Installation------------You can install ``epydemic`` directly from PyPi using ``pip``:::   pip install epydemicThe master distribution of ``epydemic`` is hosted on GitHub. To obtain acopy, just clone the repo:::    git clone git@github.com:simoninireland/epydemic.git    cd epydemic    pip install .Documentation-------------API documentation for `epydemic` is available on `ReadTheDocs &lt;https://pyepydemic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_(please note the slightly different project name).Author and license------------------Copyright (c) 2017-2022, Simon Dobson &lt;simoninireland@gmail.com&gt;Licensed under the `GNU General Public Licence v3 &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html&gt;`_.</longdescription>
