	<longdescription># Chima Python Library[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/chima.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chima)[![fern shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%8C%BF-SDK%20generated%20by%20Fern-brightgreen)](https://github.com/fern-api/fern)## DocumentationAPI reference documentation is available [here](https://chima.docs.buildwithfern.com/api-reference/search).## InstallationAdd this dependency to your project's build file:```bashpip install chima# orpoetry add chima```## Usage```pythonfrom chima.client import Chimachima_client = Chima()response = chima_client.search(group_id=&quot;group_id&quot;, query=&quot;Your query&quot;)print(response)```## Async clientThis SDK also includes an async client, which supports the `await` syntax:```pythonimport asynciofrom chima.client import AsyncChimachima_client = AsyncChima()async def get_response() -&gt; None:    response = await chima_client.search(group_id=&quot;group_id&quot;)    print(response)asyncio.run(get_response())```## StreamingChima's streaming endpoint will return a Python generator that you can iterate over. ```pythonfrom chima.client import Chimachima_client = Chima()response = chima_client.stream(level_context=&quot;Some context.&quot;)for chunk in response:     print(chunk)```## Beta statusThis SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning the package version to a specific version in your lock file. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally looking for the latest version.## ContributingWhile we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. Additions made directly to this library would have to be moved over to our generation code, otherwise they would be overwritten upon the next generated release. Feel free to open a PR as a proof of concept, but know that we will not be able to merge it as-is. We suggest [opening an issue](https://github.com/chima-org/chima-python/issues) first to discuss with us!On the other hand, contributions to the README are always very welcome!</longdescription>
