In essence, the algorithm takes the code andcalculates the best formatting that conforms to the configured style. It takesaway a lot of the drudgery of maintaining your code.The ultimate goal is that the code YAPF produces is as good as the code that aprogrammer would write if they were following the style guide.&gt; **Note**&gt; YAPF is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is&gt; just code that happens to be owned by Google.## InstallationTo install YAPF from PyPI:```bash$ pip install yapf```YAPF is still considered in &quot;beta&quot; stage, and the released version may changeoften; therefore, the best way to keep up-to-date with the latest developmentis to clone this repository.Note that if you intend to use YAPF as a command-line tool rather than as alibrary, installation is not necessary. YAPF supports being run as a directoryby the Python interpreter. If you cloned/unzipped YAPF into `DIR`, it'spossible to run:```bash$ PYTHONPATH=DIR python DIR/yapf [options] ...```## Required Python versionsYAPF supports Python 3.7+.&gt; **Note**&gt; YAPF requires the code it formats to be valid Python for the version YAPF&gt; itself runs under.## Usage```consoleusage: yapf [-h] [-v] [-d | -i | -q] [-r | -l START-END] [-e PATTERN]            [--style STYLE] [--style-help] [--no-local-style] [-p] [-m] [-vv]            [files ...]Formatter for Python code.positional arguments:  files                 reads from stdin when no files are specified.optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit  -d, --diff            print the diff for the fixed source  -i, --in-place        make changes to files in place  -q, --quiet           output nothing and set return value  -r, --recursive       run recursively over directories  -l START-END, --lines START-END                        range of lines to reformat, one-based  -e PATTERN, --exclude PATTERN                        patterns for files to exclude from formatting  --style STYLE         specify formatting style: either a style name (for                        example &quot;pep8&quot; or &quot;google&quot;), or the name of a file                        with style settings. The default is pep8 unless a                        .style.yapf or setup.cfg or pyproject.toml file                        located in the same directory as the source or one of                        its parent directories (for stdin, the current                        directory is used).  --style-help          show style settings and exit; this output can be saved                        to .style.yapf to make your settings permanent  --no-local-style      don't search for local style definition  -p, --parallel        run YAPF in parallel when formatting multiple files.  -m, --print-modified  print out file names of modified files  -vv, --verbose        print out file names while processing```### Using YAPF within your favorite editorYAPF is supported by multiple editors via community extensions or plugins. See [Editor Support](EDITOR%20SUPPORT.md) for more info.### Return CodesNormally YAPF returns zero on successful program termination and non-zerootherwise.If `--diff` is supplied, YAPF returns zero when no changes were necessary,non-zero otherwise (including program error). You can use this in a CI workflowto test that code has been YAPF-formatted.### Excluding files from formatting (.yapfignore or pyproject.toml)In addition to exclude patterns provided on commandline, YAPF looks foradditional patterns specified in a file named `.yapfignore` or `pyproject.toml`located in the working directory from which YAPF is invoked.`.yapfignore`'s syntax is similar to UNIX's filename pattern matching:```*       matches everything?       matches any single character[seq]   matches any character in seq[!seq]  matches any character not in seq```Note that no entry should begin with `./`.If you use `pyproject.toml`, exclude patterns are specified by `ignore_patterns` keyin `[tool.yapfignore]` section. For example:```ini[tool.yapfignore]ignore_patterns = [  &quot;temp/**/*.py&quot;,  &quot;temp2/*.py&quot;]```Formatting style================The formatting style used by YAPF is configurable and there are many &quot;knobs&quot;that can be used to tune how YAPF does formatting. See the `style.py` modulefor the full list.To control the style, run YAPF with the `--style` argument. It accepts one ofthe predefined styles (e.g., `pep8` or `google`), a path to a configurationfile that specifies the desired style, or a dictionary of key/value pairs.The config file is a simple listing of (case-insensitive) `key = value` pairswith a `[style]` heading. For example:```ini[style]based_on_style = pep8spaces_before_comment = 4split_before_logical_operator = true```The `based_on_style` setting determines which of the predefined styles thiscustom style is based on (think of it like subclassing). Fourstyles are predefined:- `pep8` (default)- `google` (based off of the [Google Python Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md))- `yapf` (for use with Google open source projects)- `facebook`See `_STYLE_NAME_TO_FACTORY` in [`style.py`](https://github.com/google/yapf/blob/main/yapf/yapflib/style.py) for details.It's also possible to do the same on the command line with a dictionary. Forexample:```bash--style='{based_on_style: pep8, indent_width: 2}'```This will take the `pep8` base style and modify it to have two spaceindentations.YAPF will search for the formatting style in the following manner:1. Specified on the command line2. In the `[style]` section of a `.style.yapf` file in either the current   directory or one of its parent directories.3. In the `[yapf]` section of a `setup.cfg` file in either the current   directory or one of its parent directories.4. In the `[tool.yapf]` section of a `pyproject.toml` file in either the current   directory or one of its parent directories.5. In the `[style]` section of a `~/.config/yapf/style` file in your home   directory.If none of those files are found, the default style PEP8 is used.Example=======An example of the type of formatting that YAPF can do, it will take this uglycode:```pythonx = {  'a':37,'b':42,'c':927}y = 'hello ''world'z = 'hello '+'world'a = 'hello {}'.format('world')class foo  (     object  ):  def f    (self   ):    return       37*-+2  def g(self, x,y=42):      return ydef f  (   a ) :  return      37+-+a[42-x :  y**3]```and reformat it into:```pythonx = {'a': 37, 'b': 42, 'c': 927}y = 'hello ' 'world'z = 'hello ' + 'world'a = 'hello {}'.format('world')class foo(object):    def f(self):        return 37 * -+2    def g(self, x, y=42):        return ydef f(a):    return 37 + -+a[42 - x:y**3]```## Example as a moduleThe two main APIs for calling YAPF are `FormatCode` and `FormatFile`, theseshare several arguments which are described below:```python&gt;&gt;&gt; from yapf.yapflib.yapf_api import FormatCode  # reformat a string of code&gt;&gt;&gt; formatted_code, changed = FormatCode(&quot;f ( a = 1, b = 2 )&quot;)&gt;&gt;&gt; formatted_code'f(a=1, b=2)\n'&gt;&gt;&gt; changedTrue```A `style_config` argument: Either a style name or a path to a file thatcontains formatting style settings. If None is specified, use the default styleas set in `style.DEFAULT_STYLE_FACTORY`.```python&gt;&gt;&gt; FormatCode(&quot;def g():\n  return True&quot;, style_config='pep8')[0]'def g():\n    return True\n'```A `lines` argument: A list of tuples of lines (ints), [start, end], that wewant to format. The lines are 1-based indexed. It can be used by third-partycode (e.g., IDEs) when reformatting a snippet of code rather than a whole file.```python&gt;&gt;&gt; FormatCode(&quot;def g( ):\n    a=1\n    b = 2\n    return a==b&quot;, lines=[(1, 1), (2, 3)])[0]'def g():\n    a = 1\n    b = 2\n    return a==b\n'```A `print_diff` (bool): Instead of returning the reformatted source, return adiff that turns the formatted source into reformatted source.```diff&gt;&gt;&gt; print(FormatCode(&quot;a==b&quot;, filename=&quot;foo.py&quot;, print_diff=True)[0])--- foo.py (original)+++ foo.py (reformatted)@@ -1 +1 @@-a==b+a == b```Note: the `filename` argument for `FormatCode` is what is inserted into thediff, the default is `&lt;unknown&gt;`.`FormatFile` returns reformatted code from the passed file along with its encoding:```python&gt;&gt;&gt; from yapf.yapflib.yapf_api import FormatFile  # reformat a file&gt;&gt;&gt; print(open(&quot;foo.py&quot;).read())  # contents of filea==b&gt;&gt;&gt; reformatted_code, encoding, changed = FormatFile(&quot;foo.py&quot;)&gt;&gt;&gt; formatted_code'a == b\n'&gt;&gt;&gt; encoding'utf-8'&gt;&gt;&gt; changedTrue```The `in_place` argument saves the reformatted code back to the file:```python&gt;&gt;&gt; FormatFile(&quot;foo.py&quot;, in_place=True)[:2](None, 'utf-8')&gt;&gt;&gt; print(open(&quot;foo.py&quot;).read())  # contents of file (now fixed)a == b```## Formatting diffsOptions:```consoleusage: yapf-diff [-h] [-i] [-p NUM] [--regex PATTERN] [--iregex PATTERN][-v]                 [--style STYLE] [--binary BINARY]This script reads input from a unified diff and reformats all the changedlines. This is useful to reformat all the lines touched by a specific patch.Example usage for git/svn users:  git diff -U0 --no-color --relative HEAD^ | yapf-diff -i  svn diff --diff-cmd=diff -x-U0 | yapf-diff -p0 -iIt should be noted that the filename contained in the diff is usedunmodified to determine the source file to update. Users calling this scriptdirectly should be careful to ensure that the path in the diff is correctrelative to the current working directory.optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -i, --in-place        apply edits to files instead of displaying a diff  -p NUM, --prefix NUM  strip the smallest prefix containing P slashes  --regex PATTERN       custom pattern selecting file paths to reformat                        (case sensitive, overrides -iregex)  --iregex PATTERN      custom pattern selecting file paths to reformat                        (case insensitive, overridden by -regex)  -v, --verbose         be more verbose, ineffective without -i  --style STYLE         specify formatting style: either a style name (for                        example &quot;pep8&quot; or &quot;google&quot;), or the name of a file                        with style settings. The default is pep8 unless a                        .style.yapf or setup.cfg or pyproject.toml file                        located in the same directory as the source or one of                        its parent directories (for stdin, the current                        directory is used).  --binary BINARY       location of binary to use for YAPF```## Knobs#### `ALIGN_CLOSING_BRACKET_WITH_VISUAL_INDENT`&gt;    Align closing bracket with visual indentation.#### `ALLOW_MULTILINE_LAMBDAS`&gt;    Allow lambdas to be formatted on more than one line.#### `ALLOW_MULTILINE_DICTIONARY_KEYS`&gt;    Allow dictionary keys to exist on multiple lines. For example:```python    x = {        ('this is the first element of a tuple',         'this is the second element of a tuple'):             value,    }```#### `ALLOW_SPLIT_BEFORE_DEFAULT_OR_NAMED_ASSIGNS`&gt;    Allow splitting before a default / named assignment in an argument list.#### `ALLOW_SPLIT_BEFORE_DICT_VALUE`&gt;    Allow splits before the dictionary value.#### `ARITHMETIC_PRECEDENCE_INDICATION`&gt;    Let spacing indicate operator precedence. For example:```python    a = 1 * 2 + 3 / 4    b = 1 / 2 - 3 * 4    c = (1 + 2) * (3 - 4)    d = (1 - 2) / (3 + 4)    e = 1 * 2 - 3    f = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4```&gt;    will be formatted as follows to indicate precedence:```python    a = 1*2 + 3/4    b = 1/2 - 3*4    c = (1+2) * (3-4)    d = (1-2) / (3+4)    e = 1*2 - 3    f = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4```#### `BLANK_LINES_AROUND_TOP_LEVEL_DEFINITION`&gt;    Sets the number of desired blank lines surrounding top-level function and&gt;    class definitions. For example:```python    class Foo:        pass                       # &lt;------ having two blank lines here                       # &lt;------ is the default setting    class Bar:        pass```#### `BLANK_LINE_BEFORE_CLASS_DOCSTRING`&gt;    Insert a blank line before a class-level docstring.#### `BLANK_LINE_BEFORE_MODULE_DOCSTRING`&gt;    Insert a blank line before a module docstring.#### `BLANK_LINE_BEFORE_NESTED_CLASS_OR_DEF`&gt;    Insert a blank line before a `def` or `class` immediately nested within&gt;    another `def` or `class`. For example:```python    class Foo:                       # &lt;------ this blank line        def method():            pass```#### `BLANK_LINES_BETWEEN_TOP_LEVEL_IMPORTS_AND_VARIABLES`&gt;    Sets the number of desired blank lines between top-level imports and&gt;    variable definitions. Useful for compatibility with tools like isort.#### `COALESCE_BRACKETS`&gt;    Do not split consecutive brackets. Only relevant when&gt;    `DEDENT_CLOSING_BRACKETS` or `INDENT_CLOSING_BRACKETS` is set. For example:```python    call_func_that_takes_a_dict(        {            'key1': 'value1',            'key2': 'value2',        }    )```&gt;    would reformat to:```python    call_func_that_takes_a_dict({        'key1': 'value1',        'key2': 'value2',    })```#### `COLUMN_LIMIT`&gt;    The column limit (or max line-length)#### `CONTINUATION_ALIGN_STYLE`&gt;    The style for continuation alignment. Possible values are:&gt;    - `SPACE`: Use spaces for continuation alignment. This is default&gt;      behavior.&gt;    - `FIXED`: Use fixed number (`CONTINUATION_INDENT_WIDTH`) of columns&gt;      (i.e. `CONTINUATION_INDENT_WIDTH`/`INDENT_WIDTH` tabs or&gt;      `CONTINUATION_INDENT_WIDTH` spaces) for continuation alignment.&gt;    - `VALIGN-RIGHT`: Vertically align continuation lines to multiple of&gt;      `INDENT_WIDTH` columns. Slightly right (one tab or a few spaces) if cannot&gt;      vertically align continuation lines with indent characters.#### `CONTINUATION_INDENT_WIDTH`&gt;    Indent width used for line continuations.#### `DEDENT_CLOSING_BRACKETS`&gt;    Put closing brackets on a separate line, dedented, if the bracketed&gt;    expression can't fit in a single line. Applies to all kinds of brackets,&gt;    including function definitions and calls. For example:```python    config = {        'key1': 'value1',        'key2': 'value2',    }  # &lt;--- this bracket is dedented and on a separate line    time_series = self.remote_client.query_entity_counters(        entity='dev3246.region1',        key='dns.query_latency_tcp',        transform=Transformation.AVERAGE(window=timedelta(seconds=60)),        start_ts=now()-timedelta(days=3),        end_ts=now(),    )  # &lt;--- this bracket is dedented and on a separate line```#### `DISABLE_ENDING_COMMA_HEURISTIC`&gt;    Disable the heuristic which places each list element on a separate line if&gt;    the list is comma-terminated.#### `EACH_DICT_ENTRY_ON_SEPARATE_LINE`&gt;    Place each dictionary entry onto its own line.#### `FORCE_MULTILINE_DICT`&gt;    Respect `EACH_DICT_ENTRY_ON_SEPARATE_LINE` even if the line is shorter than&gt;    `COLUMN_LIMIT`.#### `I18N_COMMENT`&gt;    The regex for an internationalization comment. The presence of this comment&gt;    stops reformatting of that line, because the comments are required to be&gt;    next to the string they translate.#### `I18N_FUNCTION_CALL`&gt;    The internationalization function call names. The presence of this function&gt;    stops reformatting on that line, because the string it has cannot be moved&gt;    away from the i18n comment.#### `INDENT_BLANK_LINES`&gt;    Set to `True` to prefer indented blank lines rather than empty#### `INDENT_CLOSING_BRACKETS`&gt;    Put closing brackets on a separate line, indented, if the bracketed&gt;    expression can't fit in a single line. Applies to all kinds of brackets,&gt;    including function definitions and calls. For example:```python    config = {        'key1': 'value1',        'key2': 'value2',        }  # &lt;--- this bracket is indented and on a separate line    time_series = self.remote_client.query_entity_counters(        entity='dev3246.region1',        key='dns.query_latency_tcp',        transform=Transformation.AVERAGE(window=timedelta(seconds=60)),        start_ts=now()-timedelta(days=3),        end_ts=now(),        )  # &lt;--- this bracket is indented and on a separate line```#### `INDENT_DICTIONARY_VALUE`&gt;    Indent the dictionary value if it cannot fit on the same line as the&gt;    dictionary key. For example:```python    config = {        'key1':            'value1',        'key2': value1 +                value2,    }```#### `INDENT_WIDTH`&gt;    The number of columns to use for indentation.#### `JOIN_MULTIPLE_LINES`&gt;    Join short lines into one line. E.g., single line `if` statements.#### `NO_SPACES_AROUND_SELECTED_BINARY_OPERATORS`&gt;    Do not include spaces around selected binary operators. For example:```python    1 + 2 * 3 - 4 / 5```&gt;    will be formatted as follows when configured with `*`, `/`:```python    1 + 2*3 - 4/5```#### `SPACE_BETWEEN_ENDING_COMMA_AND_CLOSING_BRACKET`&gt;    Insert a space between the ending comma and closing bracket of a list, etc.#### `SPACE_INSIDE_BRACKETS`    Use spaces inside brackets, braces, and parentheses.  For example:```python        method_call( 1 )        my_dict[ 3 ][ 1 ][ get_index( *args, **kwargs ) ]        my_set = { 1, 2, 3 }```#### `SPACES_AROUND_DEFAULT_OR_NAMED_ASSIGN`&gt;    Set to `True` to prefer spaces around the assignment operator for default&gt;    or keyword arguments.#### `SPACES_AROUND_DICT_DELIMITERS`&gt;    Adds a space after the opening '{' and before the ending '}' dict delimiters.```python        {1: 2}```&gt;    will be formatted as:```python        { 1: 2 }```#### `SPACES_AROUND_LIST_DELIMITERS`&gt;    Adds a space after the opening '[' and before the ending ']' list delimiters.```python    [1, 2]```&gt;    will be formatted as:```python    [ 1, 2 ]```#### `SPACES_AROUND_POWER_OPERATOR`&gt;    Set to `True` to prefer using spaces around `**`.#### `SPACES_AROUND_SUBSCRIPT_COLON`&gt;    Use spaces around the subscript / slice operator.  For example:```python    my_list[1 : 10 : 2]```##### `SPACES_AROUND_TUPLE_DELIMITERS`&gt;    Adds a space after the opening '(' and before the ending ')' tuple delimiters.```python    (1, 2, 3)```&gt;    will be formatted as:```python    ( 1, 2, 3 )```#### `SPACES_BEFORE_COMMENT`&gt;    The number of spaces required before a trailing comment.&gt;    This can be a single value (representing the number of spaces&gt;    before each trailing comment) or list of values (representing&gt;    alignment column values; trailing comments within a block will&gt;    be aligned to the first column value that is greater than the maximum&gt;    line length within the block).&gt; **Note:** Lists of values may need to be quoted in some contexts&gt; (eg. shells or editor config files).&gt;    For example, with `spaces_before_comment=5`:```python    1 + 1 # Adding values```&gt;    will be formatted as:```python    1 + 1     # Adding values &lt;-- 5 spaces between the end of the statement and comment```&gt;    with `spaces_before_comment=&quot;15, 20&quot;`:```python    1 + 1 # Adding values    two + two # More adding    longer_statement # This is a longer statement    short # This is a shorter statement    a_very_long_statement_that_extends_beyond_the_final_column # Comment    short # This is a shorter statement```&gt;    will be formatted as:```python    1 + 1          # Adding values &lt;-- end of line comments in block aligned to col 15    two + two      # More adding    longer_statement    # This is a longer statement &lt;-- end of line comments in block aligned to col 20    short               # This is a shorter statement    a_very_long_statement_that_extends_beyond_the_final_column  # Comment &lt;-- the end of line comments are aligned based on the line length    short                                                       # This is a shorter statement```#### `SPLIT_ALL_COMMA_SEPARATED_VALUES`&gt;    If a comma separated list (`dict`, `list`, `tuple`, or function `def`) is&gt;    on a line that is too long, split such that each element is on a separate&gt;    line.#### `SPLIT_ALL_TOP_LEVEL_COMMA_SEPARATED_VALUES`&gt;    Variation on `SPLIT_ALL_COMMA_SEPARATED_VALUES` in which, if a&gt;    subexpression with a comma fits in its starting line, then the&gt;    subexpression is not split. This avoids splits like the one for&gt;    `b` in this code:```python    abcdef(        aReallyLongThing: int,        b: [Int,            Int])```&gt;    with the new knob this is split as:```python    abcdef(        aReallyLongThing: int,        b: [Int, Int])```#### `SPLIT_ARGUMENTS_WHEN_COMMA_TERMINATED`&gt;    Split before arguments if the argument list is terminated by a comma.#### `SPLIT_BEFORE_ARITHMETIC_OPERATOR`&gt;    Set to `True` to prefer splitting before `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, or `@`&gt;    rather than after.#### `SPLIT_BEFORE_BITWISE_OPERATOR`&gt;    Set to `True` to prefer splitting before `&amp;`, `|` or `^` rather than after.#### `SPLIT_BEFORE_CLOSING_BRACKET`&gt;    Split before the closing bracket if a `list` or `dict` literal doesn't fit&gt;    on a single line.#### `SPLIT_BEFORE_DICT_SET_GENERATOR`&gt;    Split before a dictionary or set generator (`comp_for`). For example, note&gt;    the split before the `for`:```python    foo = {        variable: 'Hello world, have a nice day!'        for variable in bar if variable != 42    }```#### `SPLIT_BEFORE_DOT`&gt;    Split before the `.` if we need to split a longer expression:```python    foo = ('This is a really long string: {}, {}, {}, {}'.format(a, b, c, d))```&gt;    would reformat to something like:```python    foo = ('This is a really long string: {}, {}, {}, {}'           .format(a, b, c, d))```#### `SPLIT_BEFORE_EXPRESSION_AFTER_OPENING_PAREN`&gt;    Split after the opening paren which surrounds an expression if it doesn't&gt;    fit on a single line.#### `SPLIT_BEFORE_FIRST_ARGUMENT`&gt;    If an argument / parameter list is going to be split, then split before the&gt;    first argument.#### `SPLIT_BEFORE_LOGICAL_OPERATOR`&gt;    Set to `True` to prefer splitting before `and` or `or` rather than after.#### `SPLIT_BEFORE_NAMED_ASSIGNS`&gt;    Split named assignments onto individual lines.#### `SPLIT_COMPLEX_COMPREHENSION`&gt;    For list comprehensions and generator expressions with multiple clauses&gt;    (e.g multiple `for` calls, `if` filter expressions) and which need to be&gt;    reflowed, split each clause onto its own line. For example:```python    result = [        a_var + b_var for a_var in xrange(1000) for b_var in xrange(1000)        if a_var % b_var]```&gt;    would reformat to something like:```python    result = [        a_var + b_var        for a_var in xrange(1000)        for b_var in xrange(1000)        if a_var % b_var]```#### `SPLIT_PENALTY_AFTER_OPENING_BRACKET`&gt;    The penalty for splitting right after the opening bracket.#### `SPLIT_PENALTY_AFTER_UNARY_OPERATOR`&gt;    The penalty for splitting the line after a unary operator.#### `SPLIT_PENALTY_ARITHMETIC_OPERATOR`&gt;    The penalty of splitting the line around the `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`,&gt;    and `@` operators.#### `SPLIT_PENALTY_BEFORE_IF_EXPR`&gt;    The penalty for splitting right before an `if` expression.#### `SPLIT_PENALTY_BITWISE_OPERATOR`&gt;    The penalty of splitting the line around the `&amp;`, `|`, and `^` operators.#### `SPLIT_PENALTY_COMPREHENSION`&gt;    The penalty for splitting a list comprehension or generator expression.#### `SPLIT_PENALTY_EXCESS_CHARACTER`&gt;    The penalty for characters over the column limit.#### `SPLIT_PENALTY_FOR_ADDED_LINE_SPLIT`&gt;    The penalty incurred by adding a line split to the logical line. The more&gt;    line splits added the higher the penalty.#### `SPLIT_PENALTY_IMPORT_NAMES`&gt;    The penalty of splitting a list of `import as` names. For example:```python    from a_very_long_or_indented_module_name_yada_yad import (long_argument_1,                                                              long_argument_2,                                                              long_argument_3)```&gt;    would reformat to something like:```python    from a_very_long_or_indented_module_name_yada_yad import (        long_argument_1, long_argument_2, long_argument_3)```#### `SPLIT_PENALTY_LOGICAL_OPERATOR`&gt;    The penalty of splitting the line around the `and` and `or` operators.#### `USE_TABS`&gt;    Use the Tab character for indentation.## (Potentially) Frequently Asked Questions### Why does YAPF destroy my awesome formatting?YAPF tries very hard to get the formatting correct. But for some code, it won'tbe as good as hand-formatting. In particular, large data literals may becomehorribly disfigured under YAPF.The reasons for this are manyfold. In short, YAPF is simply a tool to helpwith development. It will format things to coincide with the style guide, butthat may not equate with readability.What can be done to alleviate this situation is to indicate regions YAPF shouldignore when reformatting something:```python# yapf: disableFOO = {    # ... some very large, complex data literal.}BAR = [    # ... another large data literal.]# yapf: enable```You can also disable formatting for a single literal like this:```pythonBAZ = {    (1, 2, 3, 4),    (5, 6, 7, 8),    (9, 10, 11, 12),}  # yapf: disable```To preserve the nice dedented closing brackets, use the`dedent_closing_brackets` in your style. Note that in this case allbrackets, including function definitions and calls, are going to usethat style.  This provides consistency across the formatted codebase.### Why Not Improve Existing Tools?We wanted to use clang-format's reformatting algorithm. It's very powerful anddesigned to come up with the best formatting possible. Existing tools werecreated with different goals in mind, and would require extensive modificationsto convert to using clang-format's algorithm.### Can I Use YAPF In My Program?Please do! YAPF was designed to be used as a library as well as a command linetool. This means that a tool or IDE plugin is free to use YAPF.### I still get non-PEP8 compliant code! Why?YAPF tries very hard to be fully PEP 8 compliant. However, it is paramountto not risk altering the semantics of your code. Thus, YAPF tries to be assafe as possible and does not change the token stream(e.g., by adding parentheses).All these cases however, can be easily fixed manually. For instance,```pythonfrom my_package import my_function_1, my_function_2, my_function_3, my_function_4, my_function_5FOO = my_variable_1 + my_variable_2 + my_variable_3 + my_variable_4 + my_variable_5 + my_variable_6 + my_variable_7 + my_variable_8```won't be split, but you can easily get it right by just adding parentheses:```pythonfrom my_package import (my_function_1, my_function_2, my_function_3,                        my_function_4, my_function_5)FOO = (my_variable_1 + my_variable_2 + my_variable_3 + my_variable_4 +       my_variable_5 + my_variable_6 + my_variable_7 + my_variable_8)```## Gory Details### Algorithm DesignThe main data structure in YAPF is the `LogicalLine` object. It holds a listof `FormatToken`\s, that we would want to place on a single line if therewere no column limit. An exception being a comment in the middle of anexpression statement will force the line to be formatted on more than one line.The formatter works on one `LogicalLine` object at a time.An `LogicalLine` typically won't affect the formatting of lines before orafter it. There is a part of the algorithm that may join two or more`LogicalLine`\s into one line. For instance, an if-then statement with ashort body can be placed on a single line:```pythonif a == 42: continue```YAPF's formatting algorithm creates a weighted tree that acts as the solutionspace for the algorithm. Each node in the tree represents the result of aformatting decision --- i.e., whether to split or not to split before a token.Each formatting decision has a cost associated with it. Therefore, the cost isrealized on the edge between two nodes. (In reality, the weighted tree doesn'thave separate edge objects, so the cost resides on the nodes themselves.)For example, take the following Python code snippet. For the sake of thisexample, assume that line (1) violates the column limit restriction and needs tobe reformatted.```pythondef xxxxxxxxxxx(aaaaaaaaaaaa, bbbbbbbbb, cccccccc, dddddddd, eeeeee):  # 1    pass                                                               # 2```For line (1), the algorithm will build a tree where each node (a`FormattingDecisionState` object) is the state of the line at that token giventhe decision to split before the token or not. Note: the `FormatDecisionState`objects are copied by value so each node in the graph is unique and a change inone doesn't affect other nodes.Heuristics are used to determine the costs of splitting or not splitting.Because a node holds the state of the tree up to a token's insertion, it caneasily determine if a splitting decision will violate one of the stylerequirements. For instance, the heuristic is able to apply an extra penalty tothe edge when not splitting between the previous token and the one being added.There are some instances where we will never want to split the line, becausedoing so will always be detrimental (i.e., it will require a backslash-newline,which is very rarely desirable). For line (1), we will never want to split thefirst three tokens: `def`, `xxxxxxxxxxx`, and `(`. Nor will we want tosplit between the `)` and the `:` at the end. These regions are said to be&quot;unbreakable.&quot; This is reflected in the tree by there not being a &quot;split&quot;decision (left hand branch) within the unbreakable region.Now that we have the tree, we determine what the &quot;best&quot; formatting is by findingthe path through the tree with the lowest cost.And that's it!</longdescription>
