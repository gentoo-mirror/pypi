All fixes fortypes and metadata should be contributed there.This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.This package was generated from typeshed commit `4020d256867d0ecf79cf1ca3a0eb2b423b994b19` and was testedwith mypy 1.6.1, pyright 1.1.334, andpytype 2023.10.17.</longdescription>
