	<longdescription>[![PyPI](https://badge.fury.io/py/lennybot.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/lennybot/)# lennybot## Usage### GitHub Actions```- uses: raynigon/lennybot@v1.0.0  env:    LB_CONFIG_FILE: &quot;.github/lennybot.yaml&quot;    LB_GITHUB_TOKEN: &quot;${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}&quot;```### CLIInstall package with `pip install lennybot`.To start the application run the `lennybot` command.You can specify the Action which should be executed.This action can be &quot;ci&quot;, &quot;plan&quot; or &quot;apply&quot;.The CI CLI action executed apply and handles git operations such as, commit and branch creation.The plan action allows to plan updates and save the plan for later.The apply action can either execute an existing plan, or create a new plan and apply it immediately.### DockerTo run the lennybot as docker image execute:```docker run --rm -v &quot;$(pwd):/workspace/ raynigon/lennybot```## How it worksThe lennybot allows to define multiple applications.Each application has to have a version source, which can be queried to determine the latest version.If a newer version is available, the lennybot executes multiple pre defined actions per application.E.g. Update Docker Image Tags.The applications, sources and actions can be configured in the `config.yml` file.For more information see below.## ConfigurationThe lennybot can be configured via the `config.yml` file and environment variables.If the `config.yml` file is not in the root of the current working directory, the `LB_CONFIG_FILE`environment variable can be used to pass the location of the configuration file to the lennybot.The configuration file has multiple top level objects.Each section represents a configuration object.### State| Path       | Description                                                           ||------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|| state.file | The state file which is used to store the version of each application |### GitHub| Path                                       | Description                                                            ||--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|| state.file                                 | The state file which is used to store the version of each application  || state.pr.enabled                           | Toggle PR creation in CI mode.
