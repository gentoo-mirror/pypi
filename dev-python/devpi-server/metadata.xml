	<longdescription>=============================================================================devpi-server: server for private package indexes and PyPI caching=============================================================================PyPI cache==========You can point ``pip or easy_install`` to the ``root/pypi/+simple/``index, serving as a transparent cache for pypi-hosted packages.User specific indexes=====================Each user (which can represent a person, project or team) can havemultiple indexes and upload packages and docs via standard ``twine`` or``setup.py`` invocations.  Users and indexes can be manipulated through`devpi-client`_ and a RESTful HTTP API.Index inheritance=================Each index can be configured to merge in other indexes so that it servesboth its uploads and all releases from other index(es).  For example, anindex using ``root/pypi`` as a parent is a good place to test out arelease candidate before you push it to PyPI.Good defaults and easy deployment=================================Get started easily and create a permanent devpi-server deploymentincluding pre-configured templates for ``nginx`` and process managers.Separate tool for Packaging/Testing activities==============================================The complementary `devpi-client`_ toolhelps to manage users, indexes, logins and typical setup.py-based upload andinstallation workflows.See https://doc.devpi.net on how to get started and further documentation... _devpi-client: https://pypi.org/project/devpi-client/Support=======If you find a bug, use the `issue tracker at Github`_.For general questions use `GitHub Discussions`_ or the `devpi-dev@python.org mailing list`_.For support contracts and paid help contact ``mail at pyfidelity.com``... _issue tracker at Github: https://github.com/devpi/devpi/issues/.. _devpi-dev@python.org mailing list: https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/devpi-dev.python.org/.. _GitHub Discussions: https://github.com/devpi/devpi/discussions=========Changelog=========.. towncrier release notes start6.8.0 (2022-12-05)==================Features--------- Fix #929: Cache normalized project names per transaction on mirror index instances.Bug Fixes---------- Fix #914: add locking to list_projects_perstage of mirror indexes to prevent multiple slow concurrent updates of the full project name list.- Catch exceptions in async_httpget analog to httpget.- Add locking to mirror name cache to prevent race condition on updates.6.7.0 (2022-09-28)==================Features--------- Add nginx example to ``devpi-gen-config`` with caching of simple pages for installers like pip.- Automatically check for ``+files`` when using ``--replica-file-search-path``.- Set headers to prevent caching for simple links with stale results.Bug Fixes---------- Fix #840: Correct url scheme in config if nginx is behind another proxy.6.6.1 (2022-09-12)==================Bug Fixes---------- Fix slowdown introduced in 6.6.0 when simple links for mirrors are requested more than once in the same thread.- Removed preservation of original server uuid during import. Imported state is different from the original server. Replicas could not detect the change and get into an inconsistent state.- Prevent cache trashing when updating simple links on mirrors for projects with huge number of releases.- Preserve toxresult filenames during import to keep them being accessible on the same URLs after the fix for #686 in 5.2.0.6.6.0 (2022-08-16)==================Features--------- Fix #592: return dict from ``list_projects_perstage`` of mirrors where the values contain the un-normalized project name. This allows support in devpi-web 4.1.0 to index them correctly.- Check name in project list instead of fetching project page for mirrors. This improves response times and avoids leaking typos of private package names upstream.- Use ETag header if provided by mirror to reduce bandwidth usage and latency.- Prevent concurrent updates of simple links on mirrors with a short lived lock.- Support `PEP-691 &lt;https://peps.python.org/pep-0691/&gt;`_ conformant fetching for mirrors, and requests with JSON result for installers. Proxy servers should add compression support for the ``application/vnd.pypi.simple.v1+json`` content type (``gzip_types`` for nginx).Bug Fixes---------- Fix #743: support PEP427 escaped wheels with local version, where the + is replaced by _.- Fix #895: store and return content of data-yanked.- Fix #908: include basic auth from ``mirror_url`` when fetching packages.- Fix #914: switch to write transaction as late as possible when streaming a file from a mirror.6.5.1 (2022-04-25)==================Bug Fixes---------- Fix traceback when trying to delete already deleted release or toxresult.- Preserve index config settings of plugins during import instead of aborting, even if the plugin isn't installed during import.</longdescription>
