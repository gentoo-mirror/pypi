Install it like```consolepip install mypythontools[plots]```Available extras are [&quot;all&quot;, &quot;plots&quot;]Python library==============**subpackages**- config- misc- paths- property- system- typesSubpackages names are self describing, and you can find documentation in subpackages docstrings.## ToolsThere are some extra tools not included in python library (installable via pip), but still on GitHub repository.### requirementsInstall many libraries at once (no need for Anaconda). Download `requirements.txt` file from (GitHub)[https://github.com/Malachov/mypythontools/tree/master/tools/requirements] and in that folder use```pip install -r requirements.txt```It's good for python libraries that other users with different versions of libraries will use. If not standalone application where freezing into virtual env is good idea - here is possible to use these requirements with using --upgrade from time to time to be sure that your library will be working for up-to-date version of dependencies.### sphinx-alabaster-cssIt's a good idea to generate documentation from code. If you are using sphinx and alabaster theme, you can use this CSS file for formatting.Tested on readthedocs hosting (recommended).CSS are served from GitHub, and it's possible to change on one place and edit how all projects docs look like at once.Just add this to sphinx conf.py```html_css_files = [    &quot;https://malachov.github.io/readthedocs-sphinx-alabaster-css/custom.css&quot;,]```Also, of course if you want, you can download it and use locally from the project if you need.The result should look like this&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;docs/source/_static/sphinx-alabaster-css.png&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; alt=&quot;sphinx-alabaster-css&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;## Other projectsThere are many other projects, that are in separate repository### mypythontools_cicdModule with functionality around Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. Locally run tests, regenerate docs,deploy app or package.https://github.com/Malachov/mypythontools_cicd### myloggingLogging in a very simple way.https://github.com/Malachov/mylogging### DocsDocumentation - snippets for various topics.https://github.com/Malachov/DOCS### pyvueeelApplication microframework. Develop application really fast.https://github.com/Malachov/pyvueeel### project-starter-cookiecutterCookiecutter template. Based on type (python package, python / js application) create empty project.https://github.com/Malachov/project-starter-cookiecutter### Software-settingsVarious settings stored, so can be reused. E.g. starting scripts after fresh operation system install.https://github.com/Malachov/Software-settings</longdescription>
