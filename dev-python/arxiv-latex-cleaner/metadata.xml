	<longdescription># `arxiv_latex_cleaner`This tool allows you to easily clean the LaTeX code of your paper to submit toarXiv. From a folder containing all your code, e.g. `/path/to/latex/`, itcreates a new folder `/path/to/latex_arXiv/`, that is ready to ZIP and upload toarXiv.## Example call:```basharxiv_latex_cleaner /path/to/latex --resize_images --im_size 500 --images_allowlist='{&quot;images/im.png&quot;:2000}'```Or simply from a config file```basharxiv_latex_cleaner /path/to/latex --config cleaner_config.yaml```## Installation:```bashpip install arxiv-latex-cleaner```| :exclamation: arxiv_latex_cleaner is only compatible with Python &gt;=3 :exclamation: || ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |If using MacOS, you can install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):```bashbrew install arxiv_latex_cleaner```Alternatively, you can download the source code:```bashgit clone https://github.com/google-research/arxiv-latex-cleanercd arxiv-latex-cleaner/python -m arxiv_latex_cleaner --help```And install as a command-line program directly from the source code:```bashpython setup.py install```## Main features:#### Privacy-oriented*   Removes all auxiliary files (`.aux`, `.log`, `.out`, etc.).*   Removes all comments from your code (yes, those are visible on arXiv and you    do not want them to be). These also include `\begin{comment}\end{comment}`,    `\iffalse\fi`, and `\if0\fi` environments.*   Optionally removes user-defined commands entered with `commands_to_delete`    (such as `\todo{}` that you redefine as the empty string at the end).*   Optionally allows you to define custom regex replacement rules through a    `cleaner_config.yaml` file.#### Size-orientedThere is a 50MB limit on arXiv submissions, so to make it fit:*   Removes all unused `.tex` files (those that are not in the root and not    included in any other `.tex` file).*   Removes all unused images that take up space (those that are not actually    included in any used `.tex` file).*   Optionally resizes all images to `im_size` pixels, to reduce the size of the    submission. You can allowlist some images to skip the global size using    `images_allowlist`.*   Optionally compresses `.pdf` files using ghostscript (Linux and Mac only).    You can allowlist some PDFs to skip the global size using    `images_allowlist`.#### TikZ picture source code concealmentTo prevent the upload of tikzpicture source code or raw simulation data, thisfeature:*   Replaces the tikzpicture environment `\begin{tikzpicture} ...    \end{tikzpicture}` with the respective    `\includegraphics{EXTERNAL_TIKZ_FOLDER/picture_name.pdf}`.*   Requires externally compiled TikZ pictures as `.pdf` files in folder    `EXTERNAL_TIKZ_FOLDER`. See section 53 in the    [PGF/TikZ manual](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf?lang=en) on TikZ picture    externalization.*   Only replaces environments with preceding    `\tikzsetnextfilename{picture_name}` command (as in    `\tikzsetnextfilename{picture_name}\begin{tikzpicture} ...    \end{tikzpicture}`) where the externalized `picture_name.pdf` filename    matches `picture_name`.#### More sophisticated pattern replacement based on regex group capturesSometimes it is useful to work with a set of custom LaTeX commands when writinga paper. To get rid of them upon arXiv submission, one can simply revert them toplain LaTeX with a regular expression insertion.```yaml{    &quot;pattern&quot; : '(?:\\figcomp{\s*)(?P&lt;first&gt;.*?)\s*}\s*{\s*(?P&lt;second&gt;.*?)\s*}\s*{\s*(?P&lt;third&gt;.*?)\s*}',    &quot;insertion&quot; : '\parbox[c]{{ {second} \linewidth}} {{ \includegraphics[width= {third} \linewidth]{{figures/{first} }} }}',    &quot;description&quot; : &quot;Replace figcomp&quot;}```The pattern above will find all `\figcomp{path}{w1}{w2}` commands and replacethem with`\parbox[c]{w1\linewidth}{\includegraphics[width=w2\linewidth]{figures/path}}`.Note that the insertion template is filled with the[named groups captures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-examples)from the pattern. Note that the replacement is processed **before** all`\includegraphics` commands are processed and corresponding file paths arecopied, making sure all figure files are copied to the cleaned version. See also[cleaner_config.yaml](cleaner_config.yaml) for details on how to specify thepatterns.## Usage:```usage: arxiv_latex_cleaner@v1.0.1 [-h] [--resize_images] [--im_size IM_SIZE]                                   [--compress_pdf]                                   [--pdf_im_resolution PDF_IM_RESOLUTION]                                   [--images_allowlist IMAGES_ALLOWLIST]                                   [--keep_bib]                                   [--commands_to_delete COMMANDS_TO_DELETE [COMMANDS_TO_DELETE ...]]                                   [--use_external_tikz USE_EXTERNAL_TIKZ]                                   [--config CONFIG] [--verbose]                                   input_folderClean the LaTeX code of your paper to submit to arXiv. Check the README formore information on the use.positional arguments:  input_folder          Input folder containing the LaTeX code.optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  --resize_images       Resize images.  --im_size IM_SIZE     Size of the output images (in pixels, longest side).                        Fine tune this to get as close to 10MB as possible.  --compress_pdf        Compress PDF images using ghostscript (Linux and Mac                        only).  --pdf_im_resolution PDF_IM_RESOLUTION                        Resolution (in dpi) to which the tool resamples the                        PDF images.  --images_allowlist IMAGES_ALLOWLIST                        Images (and PDFs) that won't be resized to the default                        resolution,but the one provided here. Value is pixel                        for images, and dpi forPDFs, as in --im_size and                        --pdf_im_resolution, respectively. Format is a                        dictionary as: '{&quot;path/to/im.jpg&quot;: 1000}'  --keep_bib            Avoid deleting the *.bib files.  --commands_to_delete COMMANDS_TO_DELETE [COMMANDS_TO_DELETE ...]                        LaTeX commands that will be deleted. Useful for e.g.                        user-defined \todo commands. For example, to delete                        all occurrences of \todo1{} and \todo2{}, run the tool                        with `--commands_to_delete todo1 todo2`.Please note                        that the positional argument `input_folder` cannot                        come immediately after `commands_to_delete`, as the                        parser does not have any way to know if it's another                        command to delete.  --commands_only_to_delete COMMANDS_ONLY_TO_DELETE [COMMANDS_ONLY_TO_DELETE ...]                        LaTeX commands that will be deleted but the text                         wrapped in the commands will be retained. Useful for                        commands that change text formats and colors, which                        you may want to remove but keep the text within. Usages                        are exactly the same as commands_to_delete. Note that if                        the commands listed here duplicate that after                        commands_to_delete, the default action will be retaining                        the wrapped text.  --environments_to_delete ENVIRONMENTS_TO_DELETE [ENVIRONMENTS_TO_DELETE ...]                        LaTeX environments that will be deleted. Useful for e.g.                         user-defined comment environments. For example, to                         delete all occurrences of \begin{note} ... \end{note},                        run the tool with `--environments_to_delete note`.                         Please note that the positional argument `input_folder`                        cannot come immediately after                        `environments_to_delete`, as the parser does not have                        any way to know if it's another environment to delete.  --use_external_tikz USE_EXTERNAL_TIKZ                        Folder (relative to input folder) containing                        externalized tikz figures in PDF format.  --svg_inkscape [SVG_INKSCAPE]                        Include PDF files generated by Inkscape via the                        `\includesvg` command from the `svg` package. This is                        done by replacing the `\includesvg` calls with                        `\includeinkscape` calls pointing to the generated                        `.pdf_tex` files. By default, these files and the                        generated PDFs are located under `./svg-inkscape`                        (relative to the input folder), but a different path                        (relative to the input folder) can be provided in case a                        different `inkscapepath` was set when loading the `svg`                        package.  --config CONFIG       Read settings from `.yaml` config file. If command                        line arguments are provided additionally, the config                        file parameters are updated with the command line                        parameters.  --verbose             Enable detailed output.```## Testing:```bashpython -m unittest arxiv_latex_cleaner.tests.arxiv_latex_cleaner_test```## NoteThis is not an officially supported Google product.</longdescription>
