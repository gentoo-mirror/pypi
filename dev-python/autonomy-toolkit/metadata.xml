	<longdescription># Autonomy Toolkit`autonomy-toolkit` is a simple wrapper around `docker compose` with some minor features which enhance the usability across multiple users and operating systems. The initial design goal was to aid in development of robotics projects that involve autonomy (hence the name), however it has since reduced in scale and is just a wrapper of `docker compose`.The `autonomy-toolkit` package is under active development by the [Simulation Based Engineering Laboratory](https://sbel.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://wisc.edu).Please see [the official documentation](https://projects.sbel.org/autonomy-toolkit/) (or on [github](https://github.com/uwsbel/autonomy-toolkit/blob/master/docs)) for more details.## SupportContact the [Simulation Based Engineering Laboratory](mailto:negrut@wisc.edu) for any questions or concerns regarding the contents of this repository.## See AlsoVisit our website at [https://sbel.wisc.edu](https://sbel.wisc.edu)!&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/uwsbel/autonomy-toolkit/blob/master/docs/_static/SBEL-dark.png?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Simulation Based Engineering Lab Logo&quot; class=&quot;readme-img&quot; height=&quot;100px&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/uwsbel/autonomy-toolkit/blob/master/docs/_static/UWCrest.png?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;University of Wisconsin - Madison Crest&quot; class=&quot;readme-img&quot; height=&quot;100px&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</longdescription>
