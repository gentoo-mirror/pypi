Dependencies version constraints arerespected, unless the `--latest` flag is passed, in which case dependencies willbe updated to their latest available version. PoetryUp runs[poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) commands, thus it's requiredto be installed. The difference between running `poetry update` and `poetryup`,is that the latter also modifies the `pyproject.toml` file.![poetryup_demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MousaZeidBaker/poetryup/master/media/poetryup_demo.gif)## UsageShow help message and exit```shellpoetryup --help```Update all dependencies with respect to their version constraints specified in the`pyproject.toml` file```shellpoetryup```Update all dependencies to their latest available version```shellpoetryup --latest```Update all dependencies to their latest available version except for packageswith an exact version```shellpoetryup --latest --skip-exact```Update dependencies in the `default` and `dev` group to their latest available version```shellpoetryup --latest --group default --group dev```Update the `foo` and `bar` dependencies to their latest available version```shellpoetryup --latest --name foo --name bar```Update all dependencies to their latest available version except the `foo` and `bar` dependencies```shellpoetryup --latest --exclude-name foo --exclude-name bar```## ContributingContributions are welcome!
