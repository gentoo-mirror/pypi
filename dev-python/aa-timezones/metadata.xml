(See the official[AA installation guide](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/allianceauth.html)for details)### Step 1: Install the AppMake sure you're in the virtual environment (venv) of your Alliance Auth installation.Then install the latest version:```bashpip install aa-timezones```### Step 2: Update Your Alliance Auth SettingsConfigure your AA settings (`local.py`) as follows:- Add `'timezones',` to `INSTALLED_APPS`### Step 3: Finalizing the InstallationRun migrations &amp; copy static files```bashpython manage.py collectstaticpython manage.py migrate```Restart your supervisor services for AAOnce done, it's time to add all the time zone information, so you can define yourown set of panels later. To do so, simply run:```bashpython manage.py timezones_load_tz_data```### Step 4: Setting up the permissionsNow you can set up permissions in Alliance Auth for your users.Add ``timezones|aa timezones|Can access ths app`` to the states and/or groups you wouldlike to have access.## UpdatingTo update your existing installation of AA Time Zones, first enable your virtualenvironment.Then run the following commands from your AA project directory (the one thatcontains `manage.py`).```bashpip install -U aa-timezones``````bashpython manage.py collectstatic``````bashpython manage.py migrate```Now restart your AA supervisor services.## Configure the Timezone PanelsPer default, there are 10 additional time zone panels that are displayed (see firstimage). If you want to change those, you can create your own set of panels in youradmin backend.**NOTE:** &quot;Local Time&quot; and &quot;EVE Time&quot; will always be displayed as the first two panels,no matter what.## Adjusting TimeYou can easily adjust the time that is displayed for all timezones. This is usefulfor reinforcement timers or pre-planned fleets. To do so, click on the &quot;Adjust Time&quot;button below the time zone panels, and you will see 2 different ways to set a new time.![Adjusting Time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ppfeufer/aa-timezones/master/timezones/docs/adjust-time.jpg)The first one is meant for timers, like reinforcement timers, anchoring timers orthe like. Its maximum is 7 days, 59 minutes and 59 seconds into the future. Thatshould cover pretty much all timers you can find in Eve Online.The second one is best suited for pre-planned fleets. Here you can set a fixed dateand time based on the selected time zone. The default selected time zone is &quot;EVETime&quot; but you can change it to all the available options. Keep in mind the selectedtime zone is the one the time and date will be adjusted to. So if you are going touse it to plan fleets, it is recommended to keep this set to &quot;EVE Time&quot;.To set the adjusted time, simply click on &quot;Set Time&quot; in the row you altered. Thiswill then adjust all time zone panels to the time you selected and will also alterthe link in your browser, so you can share it with others directly.## Discord Bot Command**For this to work, you'll need to have `allianceauth-discordbot` installed, configuredand running.** ([See this link](https://github.com/pvyParts/allianceauth-discordbot))| Command            | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                             ||:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| `!time` or `/time` | Shows the current Eve time and what time it is in the &lt;br/&gt;configured time zones&lt;br&gt;![Discord Bot Response](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ppfeufer/aa-timezones/master/timezones/docs/discordbot-response.jpg) |</longdescription>
