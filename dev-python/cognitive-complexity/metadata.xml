For more details and documentation, visit the[flake8-cognitive-complexity extension repository](https://github.com/Melevir/flake8-cognitive-complexity).## What is cognitive complexityHere are some readings about cognitive complexity:- [Cognitive Complexity, Because Testability != Understandability](https://blog.sonarsource.com/cognitive-complexity-because-testability-understandability);- [Cognitive Complexity: A new way of measuring understandability](https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf),  white paper by G. Ann Campbell;- [Cognitive Complexity: the New Guide to Refactoring for Maintainable Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C6AGTlKSjY);- [Cognitive Complexity](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/cognitive-complexity)  from CodeClimate docs;- [Is Your Code Readable By Humans? Cognitive Complexity Tells You](https://www.tomasvotruba.cz/blog/2018/05/21/is-your-code-readable-by-humans-cognitive-complexity-tells-you/).## Realization detailsThis is not precise realization of original algorithmproposed by [G. Ann Campbell](https://github.com/ganncamp),but it gives rather similar results.The algorithm gives complexity points for breaking control flow, nesting,recursion, stacks logic operation etc.## ContributingWe would love you to contribute to our project. It's simple:- Create an issue with bug you found or proposal you have. Wait for  approve from maintainer.- Create a pull request. Make sure all checks are green.- Fix review comments if any.- Be awesome.Here are useful tips:- You can run all checks and tests with `make check`. Please do it  before TravisCI does.- We use [BestDoctor python styleguide](https://github.com/best-doctor/guides/blob/master/guides/python_styleguide.md).  Sorry, styleguide is available only in Russian for now.- We respect [Django CoC](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/).  Make soft, not bullshit.</longdescription>
