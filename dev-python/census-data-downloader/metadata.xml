	<longdescription># census-data-downloaderDownload [American Community Survey data](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html) from the U.S. Census Bureau and reformat it for humans.## What's availableAll of the data files processed by this repository are published in the [`data/processed/`](./data/processed/) folder. They can be called in to applications via their raw URLs, like https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datadesk/census-data-downloader/master/data/processed/acs5_2017_population_counties.csv## The command-line interfaceThe library can be installed as a command-line interface that lets you download files on demand.### Installation```bash$ pipenv install census-data-downloader```### Command-line usageThere's now a tool named `censusdatadownloader` ready for you.```bashUsage: censusdatadownloader [OPTIONS] TABLE COMMAND [ARGS]...  Download Census data and reformat it for humansOptions:  --data-dir TEXT  The folder where you want to download the data  --year [2009-2021]   The years of data to download. By default it gets only the                   latest year. Not all data are available for every year.

If you don't have an API key, you can go [here.](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) One quick way to add your key:```bash$ export CENSUS_API_KEY='&lt;your API key&gt;'```Using it is as simple as providing one our processed table names to one of the download subcommands.Here's an example of downloading all state-level data from the `medianage` dataset.```bash$ censusdatadownloader medianage states```You can specify the download directory with `--data-dir`.```bash$ censusdatadownloader --data-dir ./my-special-folder/ medianage states```And you can change the year you download with `--year`.```bash$ censusdatadownloader --year 2010 medianage states```That's it. Mix and match tables and subcommands to get whatever you need.### Python usageYou can also download tables from Python scripts. Import the class of the [processed table](https://github.com/datadesk/census-data-downloader/tree/master/census_data_downloader/tables) you wish to retrieve and pass in your API key. Then call one of the download methods.This example brings in all state-level data from the medianhouseholdincomeblack dataset.```python&gt;&gt;&gt; from census_data_downloader.tables import MedianHouseholdIncomeBlackDownloader&gt;&gt;&gt; downloader = MedianHouseholdIncomeBlackDownloader('&lt;YOUR KEY&gt;')&gt;&gt;&gt; downloader.download_states()```You can specify the data directory and the years by passing in the `data_dir` and `years` keyword arguments.```python&gt;&gt;&gt; downloader = MedianHouseholdIncomeBlackDownloader('&lt;YOUR KEY&gt;', data_dir='./', years=2016)&gt;&gt;&gt; downloader.download_states()```### Usage examplesA gallery of graphics powered by our data is available on [Observable](https://observablehq.com/collection/@datadesk/u-s-census-data).[![Black and Latino U.S. population shares](./img/race-map.png)](https://observablehq.com/collection/@datadesk/u-s-census-data)The Los Angeles Times used this library for [an analysis of Census undercounts](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-census-native-americans-navajo-nation/) on Native American reservations. The code that powers it is available as an [open-source computational notebook](https://github.com/datadesk/native-american-census-analysis).[![The 2020 census is coming. Will Native Americans be counted?](./img/latimes-native-american-undercount.png)](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-census-native-americans-navajo-nation/)## Contributing to the library### Adding support for a new tableSubclass our downloader and provided it with its required inputs.```pythonimport collectionsfrom census_data_downloader.core.tables import BaseTableConfigfrom census_data_downloader.core.decorators import register@registerclass MedianHouseholdIncomeDownloader(BaseTableConfig):    PROCESSED_TABLE_NAME = &quot;medianhouseholdincome&quot;  # Your humanized table name    UNIVERSE = &quot;households&quot;  # The universe value for this table    RAW_TABLE_NAME = 'B19013'  # The id of the source table    RAW_FIELD_CROSSWALK = collections.OrderedDict({        # A crosswalk between the raw field name and our humanized field name.        &quot;001&quot;: &quot;median&quot;    })```Add it to the imports in the [`__init__.py`](census_data_downloader/tables/__init__.py) file and it's good to go.### Developing the CLIThe command-line interface is implemented using Click and setuptools. To install it locally for development inside your virtual environment, run the following installation command, as [prescribed by the Click documentation](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/setuptools/#setuptools-integration).```bash$ pip install --editable .```That's it.
