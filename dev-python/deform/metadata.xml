Deform comes with `Chameleon templates&lt;https://chameleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_ and `Bootstrap 3&lt;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/&gt;`_ styling. Under the hood, `Colander schemas&lt;https://github.com/Pylons/colander&gt;`_ are used for serialization andvalidation. The `Peppercorn &lt;https://github.com/Pylons/peppercorn&gt;`_ librarymaps HTTP form submissions to nested structure.Although Deform uses Chameleon templates internally, you can embed renderedDeform forms into any template language.Use cases---------Deform is ideal for complex server-side generated forms. Potential use casesinclude:* Complex data entry forms* Administrative interfaces* Python based websites with high amount of data manipulation forms* Websites where additional front end framework is not neededInstallation------------Install using `pip and Python package installation best practices &lt;https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/&gt;`_::    pip install deformExample-------`See all widget examples &lt;https://deformdemo.pylonsproject.org&gt;`_.

[stevepiercy]  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/260- Improved handling of the ``readonly`` HTML attribute in certain widgets. The  ``readonly`` HTML form control attribute makes the element not mutable,  meaning the user cannot edit the control. When ``&quot;readonly&quot;: &quot;readonly&quot;`` is  one of the items in a dict passed into the ``attributes`` option when  creating a widget, the rendered widget both prevents the user from changing  the value, and if the form does not pass validation after submitted then the  field value will be displayed.  ``readonly`` is supported by most form controls, but not all. Deform adds  some logic to add read-only support for a few of those form controls, as  described below.  ``CheckboxWidget`` and ``CheckboxChoiceWidget``    Due to the nature of how checkbox values are processed, the ``readonly``    attribute has no effect.    To achieve a read-only behavior, pass in ``attributes={&quot;onclick&quot;: &quot;return    false;&quot;}``.    This will render as an inline JavaScript ``onclick=&quot;return false;&quot;`` for    each checkbox item.  ``MoneyInputWidget``    The provided value will be displayed in the input and be not editable.  ``RadioChoiceWidget``    For the selected value it will render an attribute in the HTML as    ``readonly=&quot;readonly&quot;``, and for all other values as    ``disabled=&quot;disabled&quot;``.  ``SelectWidget``    For selection of single options only, the selected value will render an    attribute in the HTML as ``readonly=&quot;readonly&quot;``, and for all other values    as ``disabled=&quot;disabled&quot;``.    Multiple selections, set by the ``multiple=True`` option, do not support    the ``readonly`` attribute on the ``&lt;select&gt;`` element.    For multiple selections, use the ``SelectizeWidget``.  ``SelectizeWidget``    For both single and multiple selections, the selected value or values will    be rendered as selected, and the others will not be selectable.    Selectize uses JavaScript to &quot;lock&quot; the form control.  ``TextAreaWidget``    The provided value will be displayed in the input and be not editable.  ``TextInputWidget``    The provided value will be displayed in the input and be not editable.  [stevepiercy]  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/260- Optionally bypass the resource registry and specify a resource as a dict  where its keys are the type of asset (``&quot;js&quot;`` or ``&quot;css&quot;``) and its values  are either a string or a list of strings of paths to assets on disk.  [tdamsma]  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/485- Conditionally load ``jquery.maskedinput`` if and only if ``mask`` option is  provided. [tisdall, stevepiercy]  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/487- Changed dateparts widget to use ``type=&quot;number&quot;`` instead of default  ``text``. [stevepiercy]  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/442- Clarify that a sequence type (list, tuple, or x/range) is required for values  passed into a ``SelectWidget`` or ``RadioChoiceWidget``. [stevepiercy]  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/385- Switch from using nosetests to pytest as the test runner, as nosetests is no  longer maintained. [stevepiercy]  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/497  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/498- Switch from Travis-CI and Appveyor to GitHub Actions, due to Travis-CI  changing its plans to be ineffective for the Pylons Project. [stevepiercy]  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/492  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/495- Add Docker containerization of Deform and deformdemo as an option for running  tests, and improve related documentation. [sydoluciani]  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/493  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/494Deprecations^^^^^^^^^^^^- Drop support of Python 3.5.- ``Select2Widget`` is now deprecated and will be removed in Deform 3.0.0  because its jQuery plugin Select2 removed a lock feature in v4.0.0 and its  future development is uncertain. [stevepiercy]  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/260Documentation^^^^^^^^^^^^^- Add documentation of arbitrary HTML5 attributes for all widgets.  [stevepiercy]  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/430- Add usage documentation of ``Date``, ``DateTime``, and ``Time`` widgets. Add  documentation reference to complex data loading, changing widgets, or  validating data to Colander. [stevepiercy]  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/466.. _2.0.14:2.0.14 (2020-08-26)-------------------- Field.validate() now raises ``ValidationFailure`` upon peppercorn parse  failure.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/242- Bump maskMoney.js to 3.1.1 and use minified version.  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/412.. _2.0.13:2.0.13 (2020-08-25)-------------------- ``richtext.pt``: The contents of the ``RichTextWidget``'s &lt;textarea&gt;  was not HTML-escaped, but now it is.  Note that unescaped content is still rendered if ``delayed_load`` is  enabled.  Now, however, to avoid rendering unescaped non-validated  user input, ``delayed_load`` is ignored when redisplaying a field  containing an error.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/204- This time, *really* update select2 widget to version 4.0.13.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/459.. _2.0.12:2.0.12 (2020-08-23)-------------------- Update select2 widget to version 4.0.13.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/441- Add the ``structure`` keyword to the autocomplete template's options to stop  its encoding.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/445- Use the local HTML element for change event when removing/adding to DOM.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/331- Fix deprecation warning when importing the module ``field.py`` while testing  with pytest.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/419- Fix a bug that was introduced in 2.0.11 that made it such that the ``focus``  parameter on forms did not honor the ``off`` value for ``checkboxChoice`` and  ``radioChoice`` widgets.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/453- Remove the unused variable ``namematch`` from deform.js.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/454- Add i18n domain and Bootstrap styles to template ``readonly/password.pt``.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/237.. _2.0.11:2.0.11 (2020-08-21)-------------------- Drop support of Python 3.4.- Changed the implementation of input autofocus from JavaScript to an HTML5  input attribute.  Forms now have an optional ``focus`` parameter (``on`` or ``off``) and fields  have an optional ``autofocus`` parameter.  -   If ``focus`` is ``on``, and at least one field has an ``autofocus``      schema parameter set to ``on``, the first of these fields will      receive focus on page load.  -   If ``focus`` is ``on`` or omitted, and no field has an      ``autofocus`` schema parameter set to ``on``, the first input of      the first form on the page will receive focus on page load.  -   If ``focus`` is ``off``, no focusing will be done.  Default: ``on``.  (This is unchanged from the JavaScript implementation.)  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/365/- Replace the flake8-isort plugin with plain old isort.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/427- Improved the script that launches Selenium webdriver to clean up the locale  directory after completing a run of functional tests so that its files do not  get committed by accident. We also enforce coding style and add a formatter,  and improved the contributing documentation.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/428- Updated Bootstrap to 3.4.1... _2.0.10:2.0.10 (2020-07-03)-------------------- Correct release date... _2.0.9:2.0.9 (2020-07-03)------------------- Added CSRF test to pass coverage on schema.py.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/403- Modified the DateTimeInputWidget to use HTML5 date/time input types on  browsers that support it.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/406- Add new translations for Swahili (sw_KE) locale.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/409- Add boolean HTML attributes per Chameleon 3.8.0.  All checkboxes, radios, and selects that use boolean HTML attributes  (selected, checked, etc.) previously used `literal_false` and would drop any  `False` value from rendering as an HTML attribute. In Chameleon 3.8.0,  `literal_false` is removed and must instead use `boolean_attributes` to set  defaults.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/417.. _2.0.8:2.0.8 (2019-10-07)------------------- Add HTML5 attributes to buttons.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/3902.0.7 (2018-11-14)------------------- Add `tags` option support to `Select2Widget`  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/373- Change Python 3.7 to use stable version, 3.8-dev as allowed failure, in  Travis.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/377- Update Bootstrap to 3.3.7.- Add support for HTML5 attributes (e.g. including placeholder and maxlength)  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/3452.0.6 (2018-08-29)------------------- Drop Python 3.3 support.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/371- Add support to Python 3.7.- Make date_submit and time_submit optional in DateTimeInputWidget  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/369- Remove pinning of iso8601 to 0.1.11  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/364- i18n cleanup https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/367 and https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/3682.0.5 (2018-02-20)------------------- i18n cleanup https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/332 and https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/363- Fix bug in ``_FieldStorage`` under Python 3.x (issues #339 and #357).- Declare Python 3.6 compatibility and enable tests against Python 3.6 (all tests pass with no changes).- Closes #333: MANIFEST.in including docs, licenses and text files.- Add ``link`` button type See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/166- Add traditional chinese localization2.0.4 (2017-02-11)------------------- Added ability to pass a translator function to `deform.renderer.configure_zpt_renderer`2.0.3 (2016-11-19)------------------- Added accordions to MappingWidget:  https://deformdemo.pylonsproject.org/mapping_accordion/- Added CSS class ``deform-form-buttons`` to style form button group:  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/308- Add more options to ``TextAreaCSVWidget``:  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/309- Always render an item with a default CSS class:  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/306- Updated pickdate.js library used for the date picker:  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/248- Widget Selenium test suite runs both under Python 2 and 3.  Lots of Selenium testing headache fixed with some implicit wait support... note::    Currently Python 3 file upload widget may have compatibility issues.    Please see ``deformdemo/test.py`` for details.2.0.2 (2016-11-14)------------------- Fix regression of ``&lt;select&gt;`` widget default values not honoured- Updated Select2 widget JavaScript2.0.1 (2016-10-25)------------------- Drop support for Python 2.6.- Documentation reorganization and clean up to conform with Pylons Project  projects.- Fix select and select2 widget templates failing on Python 3.x2.0 (2016-10-23)----------------- Release polish2.0b3 (2016-10-22)------------------- Update demos and add standalone mini example2.0b2 (2016-10-22)------------------- Fix README on PyPI2.0b1 (2016-10-22)------------------- Updated bootstrap to 3.3.6.- Fix dateparts.pt and datetimeinput.pt for changes in bootstrap v3.0.3.  (The culprit is boostrap commit  `853b69f &lt;https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/commit/853b69f2d&gt;`_.)- Make ``dateinput`` work again by using the fixed name &quot;date&quot; as expected  by the pstruct schema.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/221.- Changed ``ISO8601_REGEX`` import to match change in colander- Add support for Python 3.4, PyPy3.- Raise ``Invalid`` rather than other errors when deserializing broken  or malicious pstructs with invalid types.  See  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/203- Read a time widget.- Fix a bug in the DateInputWidget.  See  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/192.- Ensured that ``None`` would not show up as a css class name in rendered  template output.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/191  we now use dashed-names (e.g. ``deform-seq``).  A full list of changes is  below::    Old                               New    deformClosebutton                 deform-closebutton    deformFileupload                  deform-file-upload    deformFormFieldset                deform-form-fieldset    deformInsertBefore                deform-insert-before    deformOrderbutton                 deform-orderbutton    deformProto                       deform-proto    deformReplaces                    deform-replaces    deformSeq                         deform-seq    deformSeqAdd                      deform-seq-add    deformSeqContainer                deform-seq-container    deformSeqItem                     deform-seq-item    deformSet-item                    deform-set-item    errorMsg                          error-msg    errorMsgLbl                       error-msg-lbl- Fixed handling of buttons in nested sequences.  See https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/197- Upload widget is themed like Bootstrap https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/280- Select widget handles the mixture of strings and ints https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/300/ and https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/299- Have the button css_class override the default button class. This is  backwards-incompatible and will require users of css_class to add a  btn-default/btn-primary class to the css_class.- Simplified Chinese translation https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/274- Don't cause unnecessary JavaScript calls on page load https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/267/- Allow override Button Bootstap CSS styles https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/2512.0a2 (2013-10-18)------------------- ``PasswordWidget`` and ``CheckedPasswordWidget`` have grown an additional  argument/attribute named ``redisplay``, which controls what happens on a  validation failure of a form involving such a field.  If ``redisplay`` is  ``True`` (the default), the password will be re-rendered into the form when  the form is re-rendered after validation failure.  If ``redisplay`` is  ``False``, the password will not be re-rendered into the form.  The default  is ``False``, which means that, as of this release, passwords will not  be redisplayed; this changes the default behavior wrt previous releases.  Values typed into password fields are not redisplayed by default during  validation failure, as a security measure (the value winds up in browser  history).  Use ``PasswordWidget(redisplay=True)`` or  ``CheckedPasswordWidget(redisplay=True)`` to make these widgets redisplay  passwords on validation failures, matching the old behavior.- When using the default Chameleon template renderer, template names can now  be &quot;asset specifications&quot; e.g. ``mypackage:subdir1/subdir2/mytemplate.pt``  instead of extensionless paths relative to a search path.  When  template names are specified as asset specifications, the  ``pkg_resources.resource_filename`` API is used to dereference them  into an actual file path.2.0a1 (2013-10-05)------------------This is an alpha release of Deform v2.  Deform v2 is backwards incompatiblewith Deform v1.  It requires the use of Twitter Bootstrap v3, whereasdeform v1 did not require Bootstrap.A demonstration site that shows Deform 2 in action exists athttps://deformdemo.pylonsproject.org.Both Deform 1 and Deform 2 will be maintained going forward.  If you wishto continue using Deform 1, because you cannot upgrade, or cannot depend onBootstrap 3, please pin your deform distribution requirement tosomething below 2.0a1, e.g. ``deform&lt;=1.999``.This first alpha release is missing formal documentation updates.  Apologies,we needed to get a release out onto PyPI, as not having one is holding backthe development of a number of platforms and applications that depend on thechanges in v2+.  Documentation updates will be forthcoming over the lifetimeof future alpha/beta releases.  However, below is a list of known issues thatneed to be addressed to make a final release of Deform 2, as well asinformation about new features, and migration notes.  You may also beable to make use of the demo site at https://deformdemo.pylonsproject.org todivine how things have changed, and what CSS and JavaScript resources you'llneed to include in your pages to make use of this release.TODO- docs- decide how to explain form.css (include in requirements or?)- horizontal/inline forms + structural things- assets for templates: deform should provide a tool to resolve that?- placeholder support for all textual inputs (and required/maxlength  see also https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/116)- display help-blocks for readonly fields?- maybe readonly should be a property of the schema, not the widget.- consider whether &quot;style&quot;/&quot;css_class&quot; on multi-input widgets should apply to  a container or each element.- audit use of e.g. string:${css_class} so we don't see unexpected class=&quot;None&quot;  in widget rendering output.- some sort of test for mapping_item input_prepend/input_append- Currently description shows up as both tooltip of label and as help-block.  Maybe make these two things separate or at least don't show them both using  the same value.- normalize CSS class names to deform-foo rather than deformFoo- sequence_of_sequences: js that processes close/order buttons has to  be less promiscuous (it uses e.g. &quot;find&quot;); symptom: buttons  appear/disappear, act on the wrong element, etc... ugh 2013/10/05  cannot replicate, but still believe there may be an issue, but  maybe iElectric fixed itNICE TO HAVE- structural widget (mapping_item.pt) - do we need that or not or what? +  add a demo- prepend/append t.bootstrap stuff- https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/116#issuecomment-23210460- group demos by widget type- handle ajax demo more UX friendly- Put drag handles in panel headers: https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/180NEW FEATURES:- input_prepend/input_append in mapping_item widget.- field.parent- field.get_root- inline attr of checkboxchoice and radiochoice widgets (see  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/182)- https://deformdemo.pylonsproject.org/MIGRATION NOTES:- removed deprecated `height, width, skin, theme` parameters from RichTextWidget  (use &quot;options&quot; instead)- removed deprecated `render_initial_item` from SequenceWidget- removed deprecated deform.Set (use colander.Set instead)- DateInputWidget renamed parameter `dateFormat` to `format` (dateFormat  now unsupported).- DateTimeInputWidget now renders as two fields: one for a date and one  for a time, using pickadate.- We no longer bother trying to use the native datetimeinput widget on any  browser, because the support is so spotty.- DateTimeInputWidget takes two options now: date_options and time_options  instead of a single options dictionary.  The options are pickadate  date/time options respectively.- It is no longer possible to do DateTimeWidget().options['a'] = 'foo'  or DateTimeWidget().date_options['a'] = 'foo'.  If you need to change  options imperatively, set the entire .options/.date_options dictionary.- merged TypeaheadInputWidget to AutocompleteInputWidget (removed delay  parameter)- AutocompleteInputWidget now accepts string type for &quot;values&quot;- widgets no longer accepts &quot;size&quot; (instead use style=&quot;width: x&quot;), except  SelectWidget (it means the size of the dropdown)- get_widget_resources now returns asset specifications rather than  deform-static-relative paths- deform 2.0 requires users to manually load TB 3.0 and jquery 2.0- required labels no longer insert an asterisk inside a &lt;span class=&quot;req&quot;&gt;  inside themselves.  instead the label element has a required class  if the field is required; use form.css to display this as an asterisk.- min_length of AutocompleteInputWidget now defaults to 1 (was 2)</longdescription>
