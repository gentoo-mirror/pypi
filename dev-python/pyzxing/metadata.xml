I would like to express mygratitude to all the developers for their suggestions and issue, which helped the development of this project to a greatextent. This project will continue to be open source and updated regularly.## IntroductionA Python wrapper of [ZXing library](https://github.com/zxing/zxing). python-zxing does not work properly and is out ofmaintenance. So I decide to create this repository so that Pythoneers can take advantage of ZXing library with minimumeffort.## Features- Super easy to get hands on decoding qrcode with Python- Structured outputs- Scan multiple barcodes in one picture- Scan multiple pictures in parallel, which speeds up 77%## InstallationInstalling from [Github source](https://github.com/ChenjieXu/pyzxing.git) is recommended :```bashgit clone https://github.com/ChenjieXu/pyzxing.gitcd pyzxingpython setup.py install```It is also possible to install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyzxing/):```bashpip install pyzxing```Install from [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/ChenjieXu/pyzxing). Now available on the public channel, conda-forge:```bashconda install pyzxing # conda-forge channelconda install -c chenjiexu pyzxing # private channel```## Build ZXing LibraryA ready-to-go jar file is available with release, but I can not guarantee that this file will work properly on your PC.You may run test script before building ZXing. Pyzxing will download compiled Jar file automatically and call unit test.For those who haven't installed Java, I strongly recommend you to install openjdk8.```bashpython -m unittest tests.test_decode```If failed, build ZXing using following commands.```bashgit submodule initgit submodule updatecd zxingmvn install -DskipTestscd javasemvn -DskipTests package assembly:single```## Quick Start```pythonfrom pyzxing import BarCodeReaderreader = BarCodeReader()results = reader.decode('/PATH/TO/FILE')# Or file pattern for multiple filesresults = reader.decode('/PATH/TO/FILES/*.png')print(results)# Or a numpy array# Requires additional installation of opencv# pip install opencv-pythonresults = reader.decode_array(img)```Or you may simply call it from command line```bashpython scripts/scanner.py -f /PATH/TO/FILE```# Sponsor&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://jb.gg/OpenSource&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;src/jetbrains-logo.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;sub&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/&quot;&gt;Open Source Support Program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</longdescription>
