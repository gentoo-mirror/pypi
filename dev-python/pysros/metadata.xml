	<longdescription># Python 3 for Nokia Service Router Operating System (pySROS) ### Overview ##The pySROS libraries provide a model-driven management interface forPython developers to integrate with supported Nokia routersrunning the Service Router Operating System (SR OS).The libraries provide an Application Programming Interface (API) for developersto create applications that can interact with Nokia SR OS devices, whether thoseapplications are executed from a development machine or directly on the router.When a developer uses only libraries and constructs supported on SR OS, asingle application may be executed from a development machine or porteddirectly to an SR OS node where the application is executed.## Pre-requisites ##In order to use the pySROS library the following pre-requisites must be met:- One or more SR OS node    - Running in model-driven mode    - Running SR OS 21.7.R1 or greater (to execute applications on the SR OS device)    - With NETCONF enabled and accessible by an authorized user (to execute applications    remotely)- A Python 3 interpreter of version 3.6 or newer when using the pySROS library to  execute applications remotely## License ##Copyright 2021-2023 Nokia.The license is located [here](LICENSE.md).## Reporting issues ##Issues, suggestions, and enhancements are welcome.  Please use the Nokia supportprocess.  Issues raised in GitHub may be considered for inclusion into the project by Nokia.  Pull requests are not accepted.## Installation ##Multiple installation methods are available:* [PyPi](#pypi)* [Nokia support portal](#nokia-support-portal)* [GitHub](#github)Note: It is recommended to use Python virtual environments where appropriate.### PyPi ###The preferred method of installation of the pySROS libraries is to installdirectly from the Python Package index (PyPi) using the ``pip`` tool.The pySROS project is [located on PyPi.org](https://pypi.org/project/pysros).The libraries can be downloaded and installed by using the following:```shellpip install pysros```To upgrade to the latest release use:```shellpip install --upgrade pysros```### Nokia support portal ###The pySROS libraries are available for [download from the portal](https://customer.nokia.com/support) for registeredcustomers.The obtained file can be unzipped and subsequently installed using:```shellpython3 setup.py install```### GitHub ###The pySROS libraries are available for[download from GitHub](https://github.com/jgcumming/pysros-examples).The obtained file can be installed using:```shellgit clone https://github.com/nokia/pysrospython3 setup.py install```## Documentation and examples ##Guidance documentation is available in the SR OS System Management Guide.API documentation is provided in this repository and may be compiled from sourceusing:```shellcd docspip3 install -r requirements.txtmake html```The built documentation will be available in the docs/build/html directory.Alternative formats may be selected after the ``make`` command instead of the ``html`` attribute.  Some ofthese include:- singlehtml- man- text## Further reading and assistance ##- [Nokia product documentation](https://documentation.nokia.com)- [Technical support](https://customer.nokia.com/support/s/)</longdescription>
