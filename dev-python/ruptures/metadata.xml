Implemented algorithms include exact and approximate detection for various parametric and non-parametric models.`ruptures` focuses on ease of use by providing a well-documented and consistent interface.In addition, thanks to its modular structure, different algorithms and models can be connected and extended within this package.**How to cite.** If you use `ruptures` in a scientific publication, we would appreciate citations to the following paper:- C. Truong, L. Oudre, N. Vayatis. Selective review of offline change point detection methods. _Signal Processing_, 167:107299, 2020.
