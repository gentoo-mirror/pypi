	<longdescription># Jupyter WorkflowThe Jupyter Workflow framework enables Jupyter Notebooks to describe complex workflows and to execute them in a distributed fashion on hybrid HPC-Cloud infrastructures. Jupyter Workflow relies on the [StreamFlow](https://github.com/alpha-unito/streamflow) WMS as its underlying runtime support.## Install Jupyter WorkflowThe Jupyter Workflow IPython kernel is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-workflow/), so you can install it using pip.```bashpip install jupyter-workflow```Then, you can install it on a Jupyter Notebook server by running the following command.```bashpython -m jupyter_workflow.ipython.install```Please note that Jupyter Workflow requires `python &gt;= 3.8`. Then you can associate your Jupyter Notebooks with the newly installed kernel. Some examples can be found under the `examples` folder in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alpha-unito/jupyter-workflow).## Jupyter Workflow TeamIacopo Colonnelli &lt;iacopo.colonnelli@unito.it&gt; (creator and maintainer)  Sergio Rabellino &lt;sergio.rabellino@unito.it&gt; (maintainer)  Barbara Cantalupo &lt;barbara.cantalupo@unito.it&gt; (maintainer)  Marco Aldinucci &lt;aldinuc@di.unito.it&gt; (maintainer)  </longdescription>
