	<longdescription># gkutils Package #A collection of useful python methods (some of which should now be replaced by astropy usage), along with some command line utilities.The command line utilities are:* coneSearchCassandra (a tool for cone searching inside spatially indexed Cassandra repositories - requires gkhtm and cassandra-driver and access to a Cassandra table with HTM levels 10, 13 and 16 columns.)* bruteForceConeSearchATLAS (a purely trigonometric tool for searching ATLAS exposure lists to check if they overlap an object of interest)* getCSVColumnSubset (pull out a subset of colums from a CSV).There are more potential command line utilities, which will be made available in future versions - e.g. coneSearchMySQL.</longdescription>
