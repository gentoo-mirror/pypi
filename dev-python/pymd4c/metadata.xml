	<longdescription>![Release Status](https://github.com/dominickpastore/pymd4c/workflows/Release/badge.svg)![Test Status](https://github.com/dominickpastore/pymd4c/workflows/Test/badge.svg?branch=dev)PyMD4C======Python bindings (plus extras) for the very fast [MD4C] Markdown parsing andrendering library.- Documentation: [https://pymd4c.dcpx.org/][docs]- GitHub: [https://github.com/dominickpastore/pymd4c][GitHub]- PyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/pymd4c/][PyPI]- Changelog: [https://github.com/dominickpastore/pymd4c/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md][changelog]- Issues: [https://github.com/dominickpastore/pymd4c/issues][issues]Overview--------The [MD4C] C library provides a SAX-like parser that uses callbacks to returnthe various blocks, inlines, and text it parses from the Markdown input. Inaddition, it provides an HTML renderer built on top of the parser to provideHTML output directly.PyMD4C provides Python bindings for both, plus some convenience features builton top. The goal is to provide a simple and fast interface for applicationsthat just need to translate Markdown to HTML, while providing flexibility forapplications that need to do more.Brief installation instructions and examples are below, but see the [fulldocumentation][docs] for more detail.Installation from PyPI----------------------PyMD4C is available on PyPI under the name [`pymd4c`][PyPI]. Install it withpip as you would any other Python package:    pip install pymd4cThis is the recommended method to obtain PyMD4C. It should work well on mostLinux distributions, Windows, and macOS, but since it contains a C module, itmust be built for each platform specifically. Those running on uncommonarchitectures or old versions of their OS may find that a prebuilt module isn'tavailable. (If a build is not available or working for your platform and youthink it should be, consider opening a [GitHub issue][issues].)For more detailed installation instructions, including building from source(which should work on virtually any platform), see the &quot;Installation&quot; page inthe [full documentation][docs].Basic Usage-----------Once PyMD4C is installed, generating HTML from Markdown is as simple as thefollowing:```pythonimport md4cwith open('README.md', 'r') as f:    markdown = f.read()renderer = md4c.HTMLRenderer()html = renderer.parse(markdown)```This is just the most basic example to get you up and running ASAP. There areseveral options for customizing MD4C's parsing and HTML generation behavior, aswell as other APIs for tasks other than generating HTML. The [fulldocumentation][docs] walks through all of those features.Contributions-------------Thank you for your interest in contributing to PyMD4C! The &quot;Contributing toPyMD4C&quot; page in the [documentation][docs] has some information that shouldprove helpful.License-------This project is licensed under the MIT license.
