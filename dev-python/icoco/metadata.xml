	<longdescription># ICoCo API - Version 2 (02/2021)**WARNING: This API should not be changed!!**See https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/icoco-coupling for full reference.ICoCo stands for **Interface for Code Coupling**. This is a norm that a code may chooseto implement to facilitate its coupling with other ICoCo-compliant codes.Practically ICoCo is provided as a main abstract C++ class (ICoCo::Problem) that a code hasto derive to implement the norm. This can be only a partial implementation as some methodsare not relevant to all the codes (especially the I/O methods of the API).The API rely on ICoCo::MEDDoubleField and ICoCo::MEDIntField for some of the field exchangemethods. An implementation for those is provided by the SALOME MEDCoupling library(version 9.7+)This package implements the abstract class {class}`icoco.problem.Problem` in Python following thespecifications of the c++ version.The Python implementation proposed is based on {mod}`medcoupling` implementation for fields and {mod}`mpi4py` for MPIcommunication. Nevertheless, it is possible to use other implementation of such concepts within thispackage.</longdescription>
