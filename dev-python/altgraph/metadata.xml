	<longdescription>altgraph is a fork of graphlib: a graph (network) package for constructinggraphs, BFS and DFS traversals, topological sort, shortest paths, etc. withgraphviz output.altgraph includes some additional usage of Python 2.6+ features andenhancements related to modulegraph and macholib.Project links-------------* `Documentation &lt;https://altgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_* `Issue Tracker &lt;https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/altgraph/issues&gt;`_* `Repository &lt;https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/altgraph/&gt;`_Release history===============0.17.3------* Update classifiers for Python 3.110.17.2------* Change in setup.py to fix the sidebar links on PyPI0.17.1------* Explicitly mark Python 3.10 as supported in wheel metadata.0.17----* Explicitly mark Python 3.8 as supported in wheel metadata.* Migrate from Bitbucket to GitHub* Run black on the entire repository0.16.1------* Explicitly mark Python 3.7 as supported in wheel metadata.0.16----* Add LICENSE file0.15----* ``ObjectGraph.get_edges``, ``ObjectGraph.getEdgeData`` and ``ObjectGraph.updateEdgeData``  accept *None* as the node to get and treat this as an alias for *self* (as other  methods already did).0.14----- Issue #7: Remove use of ``iteritems`` in altgraph.GraphAlgo code0.13----- Issue #4: Graph._bfs_subgraph and back_bfs_subgraph return subgraphs with reversed edges  Fix by &quot;pombredanne&quot; on bitbucket.0.12----- Added ``ObjectGraph.edgeData`` to retrieve the edge data  from a specific edge.- Added ``AltGraph.update_edge_data`` and ``ObjectGraph.updateEdgeData``  to update the data associated with a graph edge.0.11----- Stabilize the order of elements in dot file exports,  patch from bitbucket user 'pombredanne'.- Tweak setup.py file to remove dependency on distribute (but  keep the dependency on setuptools)0.10.2------- There where no classifiers in the package metadata due to a bug  in setup.py0.10.1------This is a bugfix releaseBug fixes:- Issue #3: The source archive contains a README.txt  while the setup file refers to ReadMe.txt.  This is caused by a misfeature in distutils, as a  workaround I've renamed ReadMe.txt to README.txt  in the source tree and setup file.0.10-----This is a minor feature releaseFeatures:- Do not use &quot;2to3&quot; to support Python 3.  As a side effect of this altgraph now supports  Python 2.6 and later, and no longer supports  earlier releases of Python.- The order of attributes in the Dot output  is now always alphabetical.  With this change the output will be consistent  between runs and Python versions.0.9---This is a minor bugfix releaseFeatures:- Added ``altgraph.ObjectGraph.ObjectGraph.nodes``, a method  yielding all nodes in an object graph.Bugfixes:- The 0.8 release didn't work with py2app when using  python 3.x.0.8-----This is a minor feature release. The major new featureis a extensive set of unittests, which explains almostall other changes in this release.Bugfixes:- Installing failed with Python 2.5 due to using a distutils  class that isn't available in that version of Python  (issue #1 on the issue tracker)- ``altgraph.GraphStat.degree_dist`` now actually works- ``altgraph.Graph.add_edge(a, b, create_nodes=False)`` will  no longer create the edge when one of the nodes doesn't  exist.- ``altgraph.Graph.forw_topo_sort`` failed for some sparse graphs.- ``altgraph.Graph.back_topo_sort`` was completely broken in  previous releases.- ``altgraph.Graph.forw_bfs_subgraph`` now actually works.- ``altgraph.Graph.back_bfs_subgraph`` now actually works.- ``altgraph.Graph.iterdfs`` now returns the correct result  when the ``forward`` argument is ``False``.- ``altgraph.Graph.iterdata`` now returns the correct result  when the ``forward`` argument is ``False``.Features:- The ``altgraph.Graph`` constructor now accepts an argument  that contains 2- and 3-tuples instead of requireing that  all items have the same size. The (optional) argument can now  also be any iterator.- ``altgraph.Graph.Graph.add_node`` has no effect when you  add a hidden node.- The private method ``altgraph.Graph._bfs`` is no longer  present.- The private method ``altgraph.Graph._dfs`` is no longer  present.- ``altgraph.ObjectGraph`` now has a ``__contains__`` methods,  which means you can use the ``in`` operator to check if a  node is part of a graph.- ``altgraph.GraphUtil.generate_random_graph`` will raise  ``GraphError`` instead of looping forever when it is  impossible to create the requested graph.- ``altgraph.Dot.edge_style`` raises ``GraphError`` when  one of the nodes is not present in the graph. The method  silently added the tail in the past, but without ensuring  a consistent graph state.- ``altgraph.Dot.save_img`` now works when the mode is  ``&quot;neato&quot;``.0.7.2-----This is a minor bugfix releaseBugfixes:- distutils didn't include the documentation subtree0.7.1-----This is a minor feature releaseFeatures:- Documentation is now generated using `sphinx &lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx&gt;`_  and can be viewed at &lt;http://packages.python.org/altgraph&gt;.- The repository has moved to bitbucket- ``altgraph.GraphStat.avg_hops`` is no longer present, the function had no  implementation and no specified behaviour.- the module ``altgraph.compat`` is gone, which means altgraph will no  longer work with Python 2.3.0.7.0-----This is a minor feature release.Features:- Support for Python 3- It is now possible to run tests using 'python setup.py test'  (The actual testsuite is still very minimal though)</longdescription>
