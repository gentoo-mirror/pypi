	<longdescription>=================================================== Nitime: timeseries analysis for neuroscience data===================================================Nitime is library of tools and algorithms for the analysis of time-series datafrom neuroscience experiments. It contains a implementation of numericalalgorithms for time-series analysis both in the time and spectral domains, aset of container objects to represent time-series, and auxiliary objects thatexpose a high level interface to the numerical machinery and make commonanalysis tasks easy to express with compact and semantically clear code.Website and mailing list========================Current information can always be found at the nitime `website`_.
