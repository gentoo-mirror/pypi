Using Rez you can createstandalone environments configured for a given set of packages. However, unlike manyother package managers, packages are not installed into these standalone environments.Instead, all package versions are installed into a central repository, and standaloneenvironments reference these existing packages. This means that configured environmentsare lightweight, and very fast to create, often taking just a few seconds to configuredespite containing hundreds of packages.See [the wiki](https://rez.readthedocs.io) for full documentation.&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/rez/raw/main/docs/source/_static/other_pkg_mgr.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/rez/raw/main/docs/source/_static/other_pkg_mgr.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Typical package managers install packages into an environment&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/rez/raw/main/docs/source/_static/rez_pkg_mgr.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/rez/raw/main/docs/source/_static/rez_pkg_mgr.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rez installs packages once, and configures environments dynamically&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rez takes a list of package requests, and constructs the target environment, resolvingall the necessary package dependencies. Any type of software package is supported -compiled, python, applications and libraries.## The BasicsPackages are stored in repositories on disk. Each package has a single concisedefinition file (*package.py*) that defines its dependencies, its commands (how itconfigures the environment containing it), and other metadata. For example, thefollowing is the package definition file for the popular *requests* python module:    name = &quot;requests&quot;    version = &quot;2.8.1&quot;    authors = [&quot;Kenneth Reitz&quot;]    requires = [        &quot;python-2.7+&quot;    ]    def commands():        env.PYTHONPATH.append(&quot;{root}/python&quot;)This package requires python-2.7 or greater. When used, the 'python' subdirectorywithin its install location is appended to the PYTHONPATH environment variable.When an environment is created with the rez API or *rez-env* tool, a dependencyresolution algorithm tracks package requirements and resolves to a list of neededpackages. The commands from these packages are concatenated and evaluated, resultingin a configured environment. Rez is able to configure environments containinghundreds of packages, often within a few seconds. Resolves can also be saved to file,and when re-evaluated later will reconstruct the same environment once more.## ExamplesThis example places the user into a resolved shell containing the requested packages,using the [rez-env](https://rez.readthedocs.io/en/stable/commands/rez-env.html) tool:    ]$ rez-env requests-2.2+ python-2.6 'pymongo-0+&lt;2.7'    You are now in a rez-configured environment.    resolved by ajohns@nn188.somewhere.com, on Wed Feb 26 15:56:20 2014, using Rez v2.0.0    requested packages:    requests-2.2+    python-2.6    pymongo-0+&lt;2.7    resolved packages:    python-2.6.8    /software/ext/python/2.6.8    platform-linux  /software/ext/platform/linux    requests-2.2.1  /software/ext/requests/2.2.1/python-2.6    pymongo-2.6.3   /software/ext/pymongo/2.6.3    arch-x86_64     /software/ext/arch/x86_64    &gt; ]$ _This example creates an environment containing the package 'houdini' version 12.5or greater, and runs the command 'hescape -h' inside that environment:    ]$ rez-env houdini-12.5+ -- hescape -h    Usage: hescape [-foreground] [-s editor] [filename ...]    -h: output this usage message    -s: specify starting desktop by name    -foreground: starts process in foregroundResolved environments can also be created via the API:    &gt;&gt;&gt; import subprocess    &gt;&gt;&gt; from rez.resolved_context import ResolvedContext    &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; r = ResolvedContext([&quot;houdini-12.5+&quot;, &quot;houdini-0+&lt;13&quot;, &quot;java&quot;, &quot;!java-1.8+&quot;])    &gt;&gt;&gt; p = r.execute_shell(command='which hescape', stdout=subprocess.PIPE)    &gt;&gt;&gt; out, err = p.communicate()    &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(out)    '/software/ext/houdini/12.5.562/bin/hescape'## QuickstartFirst, install Rez using Python 3.7+. Download the source, and from the source directory, run(with DEST_DIR replaced with your install location):    ]$ python3 ./install.py -v DEST_DIRThis installs the Rez command line tools. It will print a message at the endtelling you how to use Rez when the installation has completed. Rez is not anormal Python package and so you do not typically install it with pip or setup.py.Do *not* move the installation - re-install to a new location if you want tochange the install path. If you want to install rez for multiple operatingsystems, perform separate installs for each of those systems.Next, you need to create some essential Rez packages. The *rez-bind* tool createsRez packages that are based on software already installed on your system. Trybinding the following list of packages (note that for Python, you may needadministrative privileges):    ]$ rez-bind platform    ]$ rez-bind arch    ]$ rez-bind os    ]$ rez-bind pythonNow you should be able to create an environment containing Python. Try this:    ]$ rez-env python -- which python    /home/ajohns/packages/python-2.7.8/platform-linux/arch-x86_64/os-Ubuntu-12.04/bin/python## Building Your First PackageThe *rez-build* tool is used to build packages and install them locally (typicallyto *$HOME/packages*). Once you've done that, you can use them via *rez-env*, justlike any other package:    ]$ cd example_packages/hello_world    ]$ rez-build --install    ...    ]$ rez-env hello_world -- hello    Hello world!## Features* Supports Linux, OSX and Windows;* Allows for a fast and efficient build-install-test cycle;* Creates shells of type: bash, tcsh, other (shells can be added as plugins);* Contains a deployment system supporting git, mercurial and svn (as plugins);* Environment resolves can be saved to disk and reused at a later date (a bit  like VirtualEnv);* Highly pluggable, supports five different plugin types to do things from  adding new shell types, to adding new build systems;* Contains a version resolving algorithm, for avoiding version clashes;* Visualises resolved environments in a rendered dot-graph;* Packages are found in a search path, so different packages can be deployed  to different locations;* Supports alphanumeric version numbers;* Has a powerful version requirements syntax, able to describe any version  range, and a conflict operator for rejecting version ranges;* Package 'variants' - a way to define different flavors of the same package  version, for example a plugin built for multiple versions of the host app;* Custom release hooks (such as post-release operations) can be added as plugins;* Has a time lock feature, which allows old resolves to be recreated (newer  packages are ignored);* Package definitions are a single, succinct file;* Packages define their effect on the environment (adding to PATH etc) in a  platform- and shell- agnostic way, using a dedicated python API;* Has a memcached-based caching system, for caching environment resolves;* Has a package filtering feature, allowing for staged package releases such as  alpha and beta packages.## Known issues and limitations* Currently CMake builds do not function on Windows with Rez and  the related tests are skipped. A fix requires multiple changes that are on  the roadmap. Users have successfully implemented workarounds to utilize  CMake with Rez under Windows, but the goal is to provide a seamless experience  on any platform in the future.
