	<longdescription>The fixedpoint package offers several features that are widely used inDSP applications:* Generate fixed point numbers from  string literals,  integers, or  floating point numbers.* Specify bit widths and signedness, or allow it to be deduced* Various rounding methods* Various overflow handling methods* Configurable alerts for  overflow,  property mismatches, and  implicit casting errors* Arithmetic operations such as  addition,  subtraction,  multiplication,  exponentiation* Bitwise operations AND, OR, XOR, and  inversion.* Type casting to int, float, bool, str* Built-in string formatting  (f-strings or str.format)* Comparisons with other FixedPoint, int, or  float objectsThe fixedpoint package is unit-tested against MATLAB stimulus (with the fixedpoint toolbox), making the fixedpoint package a viable, accurate, andcost-free alternative to MATLAB.The fixedpoint package is released under the BSD license.Copyright (c) 2019-2020, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Inc.All rights reserved.Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or withoutmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:1.
