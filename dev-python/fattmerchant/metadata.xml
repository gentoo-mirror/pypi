	<longdescription># Fattmerchant Python ClientThis package aims to provide assitance while interacting with the[Fattmerchant](https://fattmerchant.com/api-documentation/) rest API.This is the official python client which is supported by fattmerchant and bugs/issues/feature-requests can be posted on the official [github](https://github.com/fattmerchantorg/fattmerchant_python_client) page.## Python client documentation at [readthedocs](https://fattmerchant-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)build status[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/fattmerchant-python-client/badge/?version=latest)](https://fattmerchant-python-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)## Install```# pre-req, you need Xcode cli tools:xcode-select --install# THEN:brew updatebrew install pyenv```Now, follow this guide to set up your \$PATH.https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#homebrew-on-macosMake sure you have a `.zshrc` OR `.bash_profile` file:```# zshvim ~/.zshrc# bashvim ~/.bash_profile```For either Zsh or Bash, paste into your rc file:```# Init Pyenv (if it exists) for all new shellsif command -v pyenv 1&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; then  eval &quot;$(pyenv init -)&quot;fi``````source ~/.zshrc# ORsource ~/.bash_profile```**Now Install The Python Binary**```cd path/to/project# First check python version`python --version`If python version comes up to be 3.x.x then skip to creating virtualenv# this is the current version we usepyenv install 3.8# so far it's installed but not used# use it globallypyenv global 3.8source ~/.zshrc# or ~/.bash_profile# Create Virtualenvpip install virtualenv# do this anywhere you have a python projectvirtualenv venv# source the venv# Note that virtualenv activates the python versoin ONLY for your current session, (your terminal Tab)`source venv/bin/activate`# this will install yapf and everything else in requirements.txtpip install -r requirements.txt```_Note: If you get an error about zlib, then you may need to install with Homebrew before installing the python binary._**When done using venv**```# within your venv session...deactivate```### VSCode SettingsIn VScode install [Python Extensions](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python)In `.vscode/settings.json` enter this:```{  &quot;python.pythonPath&quot;: &quot;venv/bin/python&quot;,  &quot;editor.formatOnSave&quot;: true,  &quot;python.formatting.provider&quot;: &quot;yapf&quot;,  &quot;python.linting.flake8Enabled&quot;: true,  &quot;python.linting.pylintEnabled&quot;: false,  &quot;python.linting.enabled&quot;: true,  &quot;restructuredtext.confPath&quot;: &quot;${workspaceFolder}/docs/source&quot;}```Then, if VSCode asks you to install anything like flake8 just click &quot;yes&quot;.Then, Select the Python binary as `venv` in VSCode:![select venv binary](./images/selectPython3.png)## SDK Usage (For client)Ensure that you have fattmerchant installed from pypicreate a new file fm_client.pyand put the following code ```from fattmerchant.client import FMClientfatt = FMClient(    &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&quot;,    &quot;local&quot;)```API key can get requested from https://fattmerchant.com/omni-overview-lp/## Test the packageGo to `tests/static_data` directory and create a file called &quot;API_KEY&quot; and paste your API Key in this file. (Sometimes this does not work as expected because of 1.Pasting the key with quotes 2.Having an extra line in the file.)### This file is added to gitignore to make sure that you never accidentally commit it.At the moment we jut have Basic_tests.py file working. To test the file you can run *Windows*`python -m unittest tests\Basic_tests.py`*Mac/Linux*`python -m unittest tests/Basic_tests.py`Developer should model their tests similar to what is written here.Ideally there will be a separate file for each controller/module. ## Update Read the Docs - If adding a model or controller, make sure you add the new `.rst` file too `controllers.rst` or `models.rst` - Then add a new `.rst` file within the controllers or models directory in this format :```My New Model/Controller ======== .. automodule:: fattmerchant.controllers/model.my_new_model_or_controller     :members:```- Deploy changes (to master)- Get login credentials to Read the Docs - Once logged in, go into the `Fattmerchant Python SDK` project- Go into the builds tab and click on the `Build Version` button, while `latest` is selected- Verify docs are updated successfully.## Release to PyPiIncrement version number in these files:- ./setup.py- ./docs/source/conf.py```source venv/bin/activate# this will install yapf and everything else in requirements.txtpip install -r requirements.txtmake upload```If you get an auth error, before you fix your password and try again, clear the `dist` folder: `rm -f dist/*.gz &amp;&amp; rm -f dist/*.whl`The project is released here: https://pypi.org/project/fattmerchant/</longdescription>
