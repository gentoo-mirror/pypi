	<longdescription>![Hapy Logo](https://i.ibb.co/XW5pQG1/hapy-logo-1-1.jpg)# Hapy - Write Python in Hausa with braces!Hapy is a simple programming language that uses Hausa vocabulary and compiles to Python. Originally as a final year school project.## InstallationHapy can be installed using pip (pre-release versions)**note:** Hapy is still in development so it might change _a lot_ before full release. You can still join us for the ride!```pip install hapy```&gt; If you have installation problems on Windows, try [installing Python](https://python.org/downloads) from the Python website gan and not Microsoft Store.Check if Hapy is accessible globally, open a new Command-line/terminal and run `hapy --help`. If you're not seeing Hapy your Python packages directory may not be in PATH or some other pip/python issue. We noticed all problems disappear when we get Python from their website.## UsageAll these commands are to be run in the command line:`hapy --help` - prints the help message`hapy --version` or `hapy -v` - prints the installed Hapy version`hapy` or `hapy repl` - launches the REPL. Exit via `exit()`, or `Ctrl-C`. Pass `--english` to use Hapy english vocabulary.`hapy &lt;filename&gt;` - execute a script. Hapy uses `.hapy` file extension. For example: `hapy lagbaja.hapy`. Pass `--compile-only` to just print the compiled script or you can pass `--save` to save the compiled Python in a file.`hapy run &lt;filename&gt;` - same as above.`hapy do &quot;&lt;code to evaluate&gt;&quot;` - compiles and executes Hapy code as a string. Pass `--compile-only` to skip execution or pass `--english`/`-e` to use Hapy english vocabulary.More options on the way :)## Example&gt; Let's say 'ayyana' is `def` keyword in Hausa and 'buga' is the `print` keyword.&gt; Sample Hapy code```python    # example.hapy    # wannan sharhi ne    ayyana muje(){        nuna(&quot;Let's Goooooo&quot;);    };    muje();```Python output after running `hapy example.hapy --save````python    # example.ha.py    # wannan sharhi ne    def muje():        print(&quot;Let's Goooooo&quot;)    muje()    &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Let's Goooooo&quot;```## ContributingOH MY GOSH üòÇüò≠, WE'RE SO DESPERATE FOR CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WE'RE LITERALLY BEGGING FOR PULL REQUESTS üôèüèºüíª!
