Datasets can have partially overlapping features (eg. genes) as well as non-overlapping features. cNMF provides a **robust, unsupervised** deconvolution of each dataset into gene expression programs (GEPs).**Network-based integration** of GEPs enables flexible integration of many datasetsacross assays (eg. Protein, RNA-Seq, scRNA-Seq, spatial expression) and patient cohorts.Communities with GEPs from multiple datasets can be annotated with dataset-specificannotations to facilitate interpretation.## ‚ö°Main FeaturesHere are just a few of the things that cNMF-SNS does well:- Identifies interpretable, non-negative programs at multiple resolutions- Mosaic integration does not require subsetting features/genes to  a shared or overdispersed subset- Ideal for incremental integration (adding datasets one at a time) since  deconvolution is performed independently on each dataset- Integration performs well even when the datasets have mismatched features  (eg. Microarray, RNA-Seq, Proteomics) or sparsity (eg single-cell vs bulk RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq)- Two interfaces: command-line interface for rapid data exploration and python  interface for extensibility and flexibility## üîß Install### ‚òÅÔ∏è Public ReleaseInstall the package with conda (in an isolated conda environment)```bashconda create -n cnmfsns -c conda-forge cnmfsnsconda activate cnmfsns```## üìñ Documentation### üóê Data guidelinescNMF-SNS can factorize a wide variety of datasets, but will work optimally in these conditions:  - Use untransformed (raw) data where possible, and avoid log-transformed data.  - For single-cell or spatial RNA-Seq data, the best data to use is feature counts, then TPM-normalized values, then RPKM/FPKM-normalized values.### üìì Python interfaceTo get started, sample proteomics datasets and a Jupyter notebook tutorial is available [here](/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb).Detailed API reference can be found on [ReadTheDocs](https://cnmf-sns.readthedocs.io/).### ‚å®Ô∏è Command line interfaceSee the [command line interface documentation](/CLI.md).## üí≠ Getting HelpFor errors arising during use of cNMF-SNS, create and browse issues in the [GitHub &quot;issues&quot; tab](https://github.com/MorrissyLab/cNMF-SNS/issues).</longdescription>
