	<longdescription>## AlfredAlfred is an extensible building tool that can replace a Makefile or Fabric.It allows you to build your **continuous integration scripts** in python, and much more. You can replace any scripts using the best of both worlds, shell and python.Want to try and look for inspiration, here are examples of commands that I implement in my projects :```bashalfred ci # run your own continuous integration processalfred publish # publish a package on pypialfred run # run your appalfred db:init # initialize a databasealfred db:migrate # plays your migrations on your database...```[![version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/alfred-cli.svg?label=version)](https://pypi.org/project/alfred-cli/) [![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-007EC7.svg)](LICENSE.md)[![ci](https://github.com/FabienArcellier/alfred-cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FabienArcellier/alfred-cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![ci-windows](https://github.com/FabienArcellier/alfred-cli/actions/workflows/ci-windows.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FabienArcellier/pyalfred/actions/workflows/ci-windows.yml)&lt;!-- TOC start (generated with https://github.com/derlin/bitdowntoc) --&gt;- [Getting started](#getting-started)- [Links](#links)- [Cookbook](#cookbook)  * [Write your first command](#write-your-first-command)  * [Write your first workflow](#write-your-first-workflow)- [Benefits](#benefits)  * [Alfred scales with your team](#alfred-scales-with-your-team)  * [Alfred likes mono-repository](#alfred-likes-mono-repository)- [Behind the scene](#behind-the-scene)  * [Why using alfred instead of Makefile or Bash scripts](#why-using-alfred-instead-of-makefile-or-bash-scripts)- [Why not using alfred](#why-not-using-alfred)- [The latest version](#the-latest-version)- [Cookbook](#cookbook-1)  * [Display the commands really executed](#display-the-commands-really-executed)  * [Customize a command for a specific OS](#customize-a-command-for-a-specific-os)  * [Override environment variables](#override-environment-variables)    + [Add directories into pythonpath](#add-directories-into-pythonpath)- [Developper guideline](#developper-guideline)  * [Run the linter and the unit tests](#run-the-linter-and-the-unit-tests)- [Contributors](#contributors)- [License](#license)&lt;!-- TOC end --&gt;## Getting startedTo configure a python project to use alfred, here is the procedure:```bashpip install alfred-clialfred init```You can run alfred to see the available commands.```bashalfred```The &quot;hello_world&quot; command is created automatically during initialization. It serves as an introduction to Alfred.```bashalfred hello_world```## Links* Documentation : https://alfred-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest* PyPI Release : https://pypi.org/project/alfred-cli* Source code: https://github.com/FabienArcellier/alfred-cli* Chat: https://discord.gg/nMn9YPRGSY## Cookbook### Write your first commandYou can add your command in a new module in `./alfred`.In this example we will add the command `alfred lint` :*alfred/lint.py*```pythonimport alfred@alfred.command('lint', help=&quot;validate your product using mypy&quot;)def lint():    pylint = alfred.sh('mypy', &quot;mypy is not installed&quot;)    alfred.run(pylint, [&quot;src/alfred&quot;])```### Write your first workflow*alfred/ci.py*```pythonimport alfred@alfred.command('ci', help=&quot;execute continuous integration process&quot;)def ci(verbose: bool):    alfred.invoke_command('lint')    alfred.invoke_command('tests')```## Benefits### Alfred scales with your teamAlfred grows with your team. You can start with one command and then add more. When you feel that your command file is too crowded, you can restructure it into several files, or even separate it into several subfolders. Alfred is able to search all your orders by scanning a folder and its subfolders. It's all configurable.### Alfred likes mono-repositoryAlfred is built with the idea of being usable in a mono-repository which brings together several python, react, node projects in the same code repository. You can create several alfred sub-projects. At the root of the project, you will have access to all the commands of all the subprojects using the subproject name ``alfred project1 ci``.## Behind the sceneAlfred rely heavily on click and plumblum :* [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/)* [plumblum](https://plumbum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)### Why using alfred instead of Makefile or Bash scriptsOne of the advantages of `bash` and `Makefile` is their native presence in many environments. By default, a `Makefile` allows you to segment these commands efficiently. Autocompletion is first-citizen  feature. Alfred doesn't have it yet.Alfred allows you to create more complex commands than with Make. From the start, you benefit from a formatted documentation for each of your orders. It is easy to create one command per file  thanks to auto discovery. You can see an implementation in this repository in [`alfred_cmd/`](alfred/).Alfred allows you to mix shell code with python instructions. In some cases, it allows you to perform efficient processing on API calls. You can use either the cli (for git, ...) or pythons libraries depending on the nature of the treatment you want to perform.In our development process, we frequently need to operate on application with several process (frontend in react, server in flask, two external service in flask). To mount those process, we use `honcho` with alfred to load `Procfile` that will manage those process.## Why not using alfredIf you want to create a cli you will distribute, alfred is not designed for that. I won't recommand as well to use it to build a data application even if you can use python and many library.Alfred command can import only installed library. You can't use relative import. That makes difficult to share code between your commands.## The latest versionYou can find the latest version to ...```bashgit clone https://github.com/FabienArcellier/alfred-cli.git```## Cookbook### Display the commands really executedYou can display the commands really executed, either to debug the arguments,either to run in your terminal again with other attributes.The option `d` / `--debug` display all the shell commands that are executed by`alfred.run()` in your alfred command.```bash$ alfred -d ci2022-02-07 19:38:31,834 DEBUG - /home/far/.local/share/virtualenvs/20210821_1530__alfred-cli-a8dwJte3/bin/python -m unittest discover units - wd: /home/far/documents/projects/20210821_1530__alfred-cli/tests.----------------------------------------------------------------------Ran 1 test in 0.000sOK```### Customize a command for a specific OSAlfred can run a specific part of the build for an OS,for example to only run the linter on a linux machine.```python@alfred.command('ci', help=&quot;execute continuous integration process of alfred&quot;)@alfred.option('-v', '--verbose', is_flag=True)def ci(verbose: bool):    if alfred.is_posix():        alfred.invoke_command('lint', verbose=verbose)    else:        print(&quot;linter is not supported on non posix platform as windows&quot;)    alfred.invoke_command('tests', verbose=verbose)```the ``alfred.is_posix``, ``alfred.is_linux``, ``alfred.is_macos``, ``alfred.is_windows`` functions allow you to quicklytarget the environment on which specific processing must be performed.### Override environment variables```python@alfred.command('ci', help=&quot;execute continuous integration process of alfred&quot;)def ci():    with alfred.env(SCREEN=&quot;display&quot;):        bash = alfred.sh(&quot;bash&quot;)        bash.run(&quot;-c&quot; &quot;echo $SCREEN&quot;)```#### Add directories into pythonpathAdding a folder in the pythonpath variable allows you to expose packages without declaring them in the manifest.This pattern is useful with poetry to be able to reuse the code of the package tests in this one for example.The ``alfred.pythonpath`` decorator adds the project root. You can save specific folders here.```python@alfred.command('ci', help=&quot;execute continuous integration process of alfred&quot;)@alfred.pythonpath()def ci():    bash = alfred.sh(&quot;bash&quot;)    alfred.run(bash, [&quot;-c&quot; &quot;echo $SCREEN&quot;])``````python@alfred.command('ci', help=&quot;execute continuous integration process of alfred&quot;)@alfred.pythonpath(['tests'], append_project=False)def ci():    bash = alfred.sh(&quot;bash&quot;)    alfred.run(bash, [&quot;-c&quot;, &quot;echo $SCREEN&quot;])``````python@alfred.command('ci', help=&quot;execute continuous integration process of alfred&quot;)def ci():    with alfred.pythonpath():        bash = alfred.sh(&quot;bash&quot;)        alfred.run(bash, [&quot;-c&quot;, &quot;echo $SCREEN&quot;])```## Developper guideline```bashpoetry installpoetry shell``````$ alfredUsage: alfred [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...  alfred is a building tool to make engineering tasks easier to develop and to  maintainOptions:  -d, --debug  display debug information like command runned and working               directory  --help       Show this message and exit.Commands:  ci                 execute continuous integration process of alfred  dist               build distribution packages  lint               validate alfred using pylint on the package alfred  publish            tag a new release and trigger pypi publication  tests              validate alfred with all the automatic testing  tests:acceptances  validate alfred with acceptances testing  tests:units        validate alfred with unit testing```### Run the linter and the unit testsBefore commit or send a pull request, you have to execute `pylint` to check the syntaxof your code and run the unit tests to validate the behavior.```bashalfred ci```## Contributors* Fabien Arcellier## LicenseMIT LicenseCopyright (c) 2021-2023 Fabien ArcellierPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
