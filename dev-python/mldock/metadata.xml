Bring only your code. ✅- For any ML frameworks, runs in any orchestrator and on any cloud. (as long as it integrates with docker) ✅What it is not:- Service orchestrator ❌- Training Scheduler ❌- Hyperparameter tuner ❌- Experiment Tracking ❌Inspired by [Sagify](https://github.com/Kenza-AI/sagify), [Sagemaker Training Toolkit](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-training-toolkit) and [Amazon Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).## Getting Started## Set up your environment1. (Optional) Use virtual environment to manage dependencies.2. Install `dotenv` easily configure environment.```pip install --user python-dotenv[cli]```note: dotenv allows configuring of environment through the `.env` file. MLDOCK uses ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES in the environment to find your `DOCKER_HOST`, `DOCKERHUB` credentials and even `AWS/GCP` credentials.3. Create an .env with the following:``` .env# for windows and if you are using WSL1DOCKER_HOST=tcp://127.0.0.1# for WSL2 and linux (this is default and should work out of the box)# but for consistency, set this dockerhostDOCKER_HOST=unix://var/run/docker.sock```note: Now to switch environments just use dotenv as follows:```dotenv -f &quot;/path/to/.env&quot; run mldock local build --dir &lt;my-project-path&gt;```## Overview of MLDOCK command lineThe MLDOCK command line utility provides a set of commands to streamline the machine learning container image development process.The commands are grouped in to 3 functionality sets, namely:| Command Group        | Description           || ------------- |:-------------:|| container    | A set of commands that support creating new containers, initialize and update containers. Also, provides commands for created new MLDOCK supported templates from previously built container images. || local | A set of commands to use during the development phase. Creating your trainer, prediction scripts and debugging the execution of scripts.|| registry | A set of tools to help you push, pull and interact with image registries.|## Create your first container image project1. Install MLDOCKThe pip install is the only supported package manager at present. It is recommended that you use an environment manager, either virtualenv or conda will work.```bashpip install mldock[cli]```2. Setup local config for the mldock cliThis command sets up mldock cli with some nice to have defaults. It may even prompt you for some set up.``` bashmldock configure init```3. Initialize or create your first containerYou will see a some of prompts to set up container.```bashmldock project init --dir my_ml_container```note:- Just hit Return/Enter to accept all the defaults.4. Build your container image locally```bashmldock local build --dir my_ml_container```5. Run your training locally```bashmldock local train --dir my_ml_container```6. Run your training locally```bashmldock local deploy --dir my_ml_container```## Putting your model in the cloud#### Push to Dockerhub1. Add the following to `.env````DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=&lt;your/user/name&gt;DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD=&lt;your/dockerhub/password&gt;DOCKERHUB_REGISTRY=https://index.docker.io/v1/DOCKERHUB_REPO=&lt;your/user/repo/name&gt;```2. Push your container to dockerhub```bashmldock registry push --dir my_ml_container --provider dockerhub --build```note: The flags allow you to stipulate configuration changes in the command.`--build` says build the image before pushing. This is required initially since the dockerhub registry will prefix your container name. `--provider` tells MLDOCK to authenticate to dockerhub and push the container there. **hint** In addition to `DockerHub`, both `AWS ECR` &amp; `GCP GCR` are also supported. ## helpful tips- docker compose sees my files as directories in mounted volume - *USE &quot;./path/to/file&quot; format* | https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42248198/how-to-mount-a-single-file-in-a-volume- simlinks from my container have broken permissions in WSL2 | https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/1475</longdescription>
