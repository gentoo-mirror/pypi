	<longdescription>üêç About This Forküç¥--------------------This is a fork of https://github.com/spotify/snakebite, viahttps://github.com/kirklg/snakebite/tree/feature/python3. We maintain it enoughto work for our needs at the Internet Archive. We use the library with our CDH5cluster and have not tested it with any other versions of hadoop. Please helpus improve this! Or make your own fork. No hard feelings.![Snakebite mini logo](https://github.com/internetarchive/snakebite-py3/blob/master/doc/logo/logo-mini-typo.png)---Snakebite is a python library that provides a pure python HDFS clientand a wrapper around Hadoops minicluster. The client uses protobuf forcommunicating with the NameNode and comes in the form of a library and acommand line interface. Currently, the snakebite client supports mostactions that involve the Namenode and reading data from DataNodes.*Note:* all methods that read data from a data node are able to checkthe CRC during transfer, but this is disabled by default because ofperformance reasons. This is the opposite behaviour from the stockHadoop client.~Snakebite requires python2 (python3 is not supported yet)~ andpython-protobuf 2.4.1 or higher.Snakebite 1.3.x has been tested mainly against Cloudera CDH4.1.3 (hadoop2.0.0) in production. Tests pass on HortonWorks HDP 2.0.3.22-alpha(protocol versions 7 and 8)Snakebite 2.x has been tested on Hortonworks HDP2.0 and CDH5 Beta andONLY supports Hadoop 2.2.0 and up (protocol version 9)!Installing==========Snakebite-py3 releases will be available through pypi at&lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/snakebite-py3/&gt;To install snakebite run:`pip install snakebite-py3`Documentation=============More information and documentation can be found athttps://snakebite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Development===========Travis CI status: [![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/internetarchive/snakebite-py3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/internetarchive/snakebite-py3)[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/spotify/snakebite](https://badges.gitter.im/spotify/snakebite.svg)](https://gitter.im/spotify/snakebite?utm_source=badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge&amp;utm_content=badge)Copyright 2013-2016 Spotify ABCopyright 2016-2019 Internet Archive and individual contributors</longdescription>
