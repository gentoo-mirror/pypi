	<longdescription># YarkYouTube archiving made simple.&lt;!-- NOTE: rewrite delayed for now, ah well --&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Owez/yark/tree/v1.3-rewrite&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./examples/images/rewrite.png&quot; alt=&quot;Yark is being rewritten on the v1.3-rewrite branch!&quot; width=400 /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; --&gt;&lt;!-- NOTE: uncomment when new gui is out --&gt;&lt;!-- If you're reading this, you're probably trying to download/use Yark via PyPI which has been removed in newer versions. You can download a modern version of Yark [here](https://github.com/Owez/yark).&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Owez/yark/1.2-support/examples/images/transition.png&quot; alt=&quot;Version release transition&quot; title=&quot;Version release transition&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;## InstallationTo install Yark, simply download [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (optional), then run the following:```shell$ pip3 install yark```## Managing your ArchiveOnce you've installed Yark, think of a name for your archive (e.g., &quot;foobar&quot;) and copy the target's url:```shell$ yark new foobar https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSMdm6bUYIBN0KfS2CVuEPA```Now that you've created the archive, you can tell Yark to download all videos and metadata using the refresh command:```shell$ yark refresh foobar```Once everything has been downloaded, Yark will automatically give you a status report of what's changed since the last refresh:&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Owez/yark/1.2-support/examples/images/cli_dark.png&quot; alt=&quot;Report Demo&quot; title=&quot;Report Demo&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;## Viewing your ArchiveViewing you archive is easy, just type `view` with your archives name:```shell$ yark view foobar```This will pop up an offline website in your browser letting you watch all videos üöÄ&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Owez/yark/1.2-support/examples/images/viewer_light.png&quot; alt=&quot;Viewer Demo&quot; title=&quot;Viewer Demo&quot; width=650 /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Under each video is a rich history report filled with timelines and graphs, as well as a noting feature which lets you add timestamped and permalinked comments üëê&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Owez/yark/1.2-support/examples/images/viewer_stats_light.png&quot; alt=&quot;Viewer Demo ‚Äì Stats&quot; title=&quot;Viewer Demo ‚Äì Stats&quot; width=650 /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Light and dark modes are both available and automatically apply based on the system's theme.## DetailsHere are some things to keep in mind when using Yark; the good and the bad:- Don't create a new archive again if you just want to update it, Yark accumulates all new metadata for you via timestamps- Feel free to suggest new features via the issues tab on this repository- Scheduling isn't a feature just yet, please use [`cron`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) or something similar!## Archive FormatThe archive format itself is simple and consists of a directory-based structure with a core metadata file and all thumbnail/video data in their own directories as typical files:- `[name]/` ‚Äì Your self-contained archive  - `yark.json` ‚Äì Archive file with all metadata  - `yark.bak` ‚Äì Backup archive file to protect against data damage  - `videos/` ‚Äì Directory containing all known videos    - `[id].*` ‚Äì Files containing video data for YouTube videos  - `thumbnails/` ‚Äì Directory containing all known thumbnails    - `[hash].png` ‚Äì Files containing thumbnails with its hashIt's best to take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with your archive by looking at files which look interesting to you in it, everything is quite readable.</longdescription>
