	<longdescription>Image building tools for OpenStack==================================``diskimage-builder`` is a flexible suite of components for building awide-range of disk images, filesystem images and ramdisk images foruse with OpenStack.This repository has the core functionality for building such images,both virtual and bare metal. Images are composed using `elements`;while fundamental elements are provided here, individual projects havethe flexibility to customise the image build with their own elements.For example::  $ DIB_RELEASE=bionic disk-image-create -o ubuntu-bionic.qcow2 vm ubuntuwill create a bootable Ubuntu Bionic based ``qcow2`` image.``diskimage-builder`` is useful to anyone looking to producecustomised images for deployment into clouds. These tools are thecomponents of `TripleO &lt;https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleO&gt;`__that are responsible for building disk images. They are also usedextensively to build images for testing OpenStack itself, particularlywith `nodepool&lt;https://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/nodepool.html&gt;`__.Platforms supported include Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL and Fedora.Full documentation, the source of which is in ``doc/source/``, ispublished at:* https://docs.openstack.org/diskimage-builder/latest/Copyright=========Copyright 2012 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.Copyright (c) 2012 NTT DOCOMO, INC.All Rights Reserved.Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;); you maynot use this file except in compliance with the License.
