Using C++ techniques DUNE allows one to use verydifferent implementation of the same concept (i.e. grid, solver, ...) undera common interface with a very low overhead.DUNE was designed with flexibility in mind. It supports easy discretizationusing methods, like Finite Elements, Finite Volume and also FiniteDifferences. Through separation of data structures DUNE allows fast LinearAlgebra like provided in the ISTL module, or usage of external librarieslike blas.This package contains the basic DUNE common classes.Dependencies------------dune-common depends on the following software packages- pkg-config- Compiler (C, C++): GNU &gt;=7 or Clang &gt;= 5  Other compilers might work too, they need to support C++17 to the extend the  ones above do.The following software is recommended but optional:- MPI (either OpenMPI, lam, or mpich suffice)For a full explanation of the DUNE installation process please readthe [installation notes][installation]. The following introduction is meant forthe impatient.License-------The DUNE-library and headers are licensed under version 2 of the GNUGeneral Public License, with the so-called &quot;runtime exception&quot;, asfollows:&gt; As a special exception, you may use the DUNE source files as part&gt; of a software library or application without restriction.&gt; Specifically, if other files instantiate templates or use macros or&gt; inline functions from one or more of the DUNE source files, or you&gt; compile one or more of the DUNE source files and link them with&gt; other files to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause&gt; Athe resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public&gt; License.  This exception does not however invalidate any other&gt; reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU General&gt; Public License.This licence clones the one of the libstc++ library.
