	<longdescription># discord-typingsMaintained typings of all payloads that Discord sends as `TypedDict`s.## Naming and usageRight now there is no official documentation or API Reference - just startimporting things and your editor will auto-complete options. This may change inthe future though.The naming used is the suffixes `Data`, `Event` and `Command` for the threetypes of payloads. `Event` refers to a gateway event received over the gateway,`Command` refers to a gateway command sent over the gateway and `Data` is usedfor any general top-level payloads like `UserData`.The benefit of using `Data` as a suffix is that in your code you can use`from discord_typings import UserData` even if you define a `User` object (asis expected to be rather common).### ExceptionsTo differentiate between the data for complete application commands, and thedata Discord expects to receive to create an application command, there isa special-cased `ApplicationCommandPayload`.</longdescription>
