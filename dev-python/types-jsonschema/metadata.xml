	<longdescription>## Typing stubs for jsonschemaThis is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)type stub package for the [`jsonschema`](https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema) package.It can be used by type-checking tools like[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses`jsonschema`.This version of `types-jsonschema` aims to provide accurate annotationsfor `jsonschema==4.20.*`.The source for this package can be found athttps://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/jsonschema. All fixes fortypes and metadata should be contributed there.This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.This package was generated from typeshed commit `62ccb32b2257c72a2e772d625bec02cc02b6c6ff` and was testedwith mypy 1.7.0, pyright 1.1.334, andpytype 2023.10.31.</longdescription>
