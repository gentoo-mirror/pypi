	<longdescription># Overview**Author:** Niklas Baumstarkdryscrape is a lightweight web scraping library for Python. It uses a headless Webkit instance to evaluate Javascript on the visited pages. This enables painless scraping of plain web pages as well as Javascript-heavy “Web 2.0” applications likeFacebook.It is built on the shoulders of[capybara-webkit](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit)'s [webkit-server](https://github.com/niklasb/webkit-server). A big thanks goes to thoughtbot, inc. for building this excellent piece of software!# Changelog* 1.0: Added Python 3 support, small performance fixes, header names are now  properly normalized. Also added the function `dryscrape.start_xvfb()` to  easily start Xvfb.* 0.9.1: Changed semantics of the `headers` function in  a backwards-incompatible way: It now returns a list of (key, value)  pairs instead of a dictionary.# Supported PlatformsThe library has been confirmed to work on the following platforms:* Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks and 10.10 Yosemite* Ubuntu Linux* Arch LinuxOther unixoid systems should work just fine.Windows is not officially supported, although dryscrape should workwith [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).# Installation, Usage, API DocsDocumentation can be found at [dryscrape's ReadTheDocs page](http://readthedocs.org/docs/dryscrape/).Quick installation instruction:    # pip install dryscrape# Contact, Bugs, ContributionsIf you have any problems with this software, don't hesitate to open anissue on [Github](https://github.com/niklasb/dryscrape) or open a pullrequest or write a mail to **niklas baumstark at Gmail**.</longdescription>
