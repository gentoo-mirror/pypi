	<longdescription># ail-typo-squattingail-typo-squatting is a Python library to generate list of potential typo squatting domains with domain name permutation engine to feed AIL and other systems. The tool can be used as a stand-alone tool or to feed other systems.# Requirements- Python 3.6+- [inflect](https://github.com/jaraco/inflect) library- [pyyaml](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation)## Optional- [dnspython](https://github.com/rthalley/dnspython)# Installation## Source installail-typo-squatting can be install with poetry. If you don't have poetry installed, you can do the following `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python`.```bash$ poetry install$ poetry shell$ cd ail-typo-squatting$ python typo.py -h```## pip installation```bash$ pip3 install ail-typo-squatting```# Usage```bashdacru@dacru:~/git/ail-typo-squatting/bin$ python3 typo.py --help  usage: typo.py [-h] [-v] [-dn DOMAINNAME [DOMAINNAME ...]] [-fdn FILEDOMAINNAME] [-o OUTPUT]               [-fo FORMATOUTPUT] [-br] [-dnsr] [-dnsl] [-l LIMIT] [-var] [-ko] [-a] [-om] [-repe] [-repl]               [-drepl] [-cho] [-add] [-md] [-sd] [-vs] [-ada] [-hg] [-ahg] [-cm] [-hp] [-wt] [-wsld] [-at]               [-sub] [-sp] [-cdd] [-addns] [-ns] [-combo] [-ca]optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -v                    verbose, more display  -dn DOMAINNAME [DOMAINNAME ...], --domainName DOMAINNAME [DOMAINNAME ...]                        list of domain name  -fdn FILEDOMAINNAME, --filedomainName FILEDOMAINNAME                        file containing list of domain name  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT                        path to ouput location  -fo FORMATOUTPUT, --formatoutput FORMATOUTPUT                        format for the output file, yara - regex - yaml - text.

Example: google.com becomes google.com.it                                                                                                                                   || ChangeDotDash      | These typos are created by changing a dot to a dash.                                                                                                                                                                                      || ChangeOrder        | These typos are created by changing the order of letters in the each part of the domain.                                                                                                                                                  || Combo              | These typos are created by combining multiple algorithms.

Over 8000 common misspellings from Wikipedia. For example, www.youtube.com becomes www.youtub.com and www.abseil.com becomes www.absail.com.                                || Double Replacement | These typos are created by replacing identical, consecutive letters of the domain name.                                                                                                                                                   || Homoglyph          | These typos are created by replacing characters to another character that look similar but are different.  An example is that the lower case l looks similar to the numeral one, e.g. l vs 1. For example, google.com becomes goog1e.com. || Homophones         | These typos are created by changing word by an other who sound the same when spoken. Over 450 sets of words that sound the same when spoken. For example, www.base.com becomes www.bass.com.                                              || MissingDot         | These typos are created by deleting a dot from the domain name.                                                                                                                                                                           || NumeralSwap        | These typos are created by changing a number to words and vice versa. For example, circlone.lu becomes circl1.lu.                                                                                                                         || Omission           | These typos are created by leaving out a letter of the domain name, one letter at a time.                                                                                                                                                 || Repetition         | These typos are created by repeating a letter of the domain name.                                                                                                                                                                         || Replacement        | These typos are created by replacing each letter of the domain name.                                                                                                                                                                      || StripDash          | These typos are created by deleting a dash from the domain name.                                                                                                                                                                          || SingularPluralize  | These typos are created by making a singular domain plural and vice versa.                                                                                                                                                                || Subdomain          | These typos are created by placing a dot in the domain name in order to create subdomain. Example: google.com becomes goo.gle.com                                                                                                         || VowelSwap          | These typos are created by swapping vowels within the domain name except for the first letter. For example, www.google.com becomes www.gaagle.com.                                                                                        || WrongTld           | These typos are created by changing the original top level domain to another. For example, www.trademe.co.nz becomes www.trademe.co.mz and www.google.com becomes www.google.org Uses the 19 most common top level domains.               || WrongSld           | These typos are created by changing the original second level domain to another. For example, www.trademe.co.uk becomes www.trademe.ac.uk and www.google.com will still be www.google.com .                                               |# Acknowledgment![](./img/cef.png)The project has been co-funded by CEF-TC-2020-2 - 2020-EU-IA-0260 - JTAN - Joint Threat Analysis Network.</longdescription>
