It reads text, line by line, from a file and replace, insert or print all text or specific area.Installation------------.. code-block:: bash    $ pip install pysed --upgrade    uninstall    $ pip uninstall pysed        Command Line Tool Usage-----------------------.. code-block:: bash    Usage: pysed [OPTION] {patt} {repl} {lines/max/flag} [[input-file], --write]    pysed is utility that parses and transforms text    Optional arguments:      -h, --help            Print this help message and exit      -v, --version         Print program version and exit      -r, --replace         Search and replace text      -f, --findall         Find all from pattern in text      -s, --search          Search for the first matching      -m, --match           Pattern matching in the beginning      -l, --lines           Search pattern and print lines      -g, --highlight       Highlight and print text      -t, --stat            Print text statistics          --write           Write changes to fileRegex flags------------------.. list-table::   :widths: 20 80   :header-rows: 1   * - Syntax     - Python syntax,Meaning   * - I or IGNORECASE     - re.IGNORECASE,ignore case.   * - M or MULTILINE     - re.MULTILINE,make begin/end {^, $} consider each line.   * - S or DOTALL     - re.DOTALL,make . match newline too.   * - U or UNICODE     - re.UNICODE,make {\w, \W, \b, \B} follow Unicode rules.   * - L or LOCALE     - re.LOCALE,make {\w, \W, \b, \B} follow locale.   * - X or VERBOSE     - re.VERBOSE,allow comment in regex.

You can use &quot;find&quot; and &quot;pysed&quot; commands in combination to find     and replace text in multiple files. For example:    $ find . -name *.py -exec pysed -r &quot;lefttext&quot; &quot;righttext&quot; {} --write \;        this command finds 'lefttext' string in all python files and replace it with 'righttext'.Please report `Issues &lt;https://github.com/dslackw/pysed/issues&gt;`_Copyright ---------- Copyright Â© Dimitris Zlatanidis- Linux is a Registered Trademark of Linus Torvalds.</longdescription>
