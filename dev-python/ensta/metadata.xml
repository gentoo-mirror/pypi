Ensta uses Instagram's Original Web API to scrape data which makes it a reliable choice over other third-party scrapers. This library mainly focuses on Simplicity &amp; Reliability.Two type of classes are supported - ***Guest &amp; Host***.[&lt;img style=&quot;margin-top: 10px&quot; src=&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/guidelines/download-assets-sm-1.svg&quot; width=&quot;160&quot;/&gt;](https://buymeacoffee.com/diezo)## üì¢ Announcements**[#02]** [AutoHost](https://github.com/diezo/ensta/) is released! Authentication update to the *Host Class*.**[#01]** Users can now log in through their **Username** and **Password** to generate SessionId! [See this](https://github.com/diezo/ensta#:~:text=NewSessionID(%22username%22%2C%20%22password%22))## InstallationTo install this package using [Python's PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), run this command in a terminal window:```shell$ pip install ensta```To update the existing package, run:```shell$ pip install ensta --upgrade```## üßîüèª‚ôÇÔ∏è Guest ModeThis mode doesn't require login and can be used to fetch publicly available data from Instagram's Servers. Following methods are supported till now:- Check if username is available for registration- Fetch someone's profile data- Convert username to userid- Convert userid to usernameHere's an example where an instance of *Guest Class* is created to fetch [Cristiano Ronaldo's](https://www.instagram.com/cristiano/) profile information:```pythonfrom ensta import Guestguest = Guest()profile = guest.profile(&quot;cristiano&quot;)if profile is None:    print(&quot;Something went wrong.&quot;)else:    print(profile.biography)    print(profile.follower_count)    print(profile.following_count)```## üßîüèª‚ôÇÔ∏è Host ModeHost mode requires login through SessionID, which should be passed as an argument during initialization.It can be used to take actions that require login. Additionally, users can manage their own profile through this class.These are the methods supported till now:- Check authentication status of the user- Follow/unfollow users- Fetch someone's follower/following list- Switch account type - 'Public' or 'Private'Here's an example where an instance of *Host Class* is created to follow [Cristiano Ronaldo's](https://www.instagram.com/cristiano/) account:```pythonfrom ensta import Host, NewSessionIDsessionid = NewSessionID(&quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)host = Host(sessionid)status = host.follow(&quot;cristiano&quot;)if status is None:    print(&quot;Something went wrong.&quot;)else:    if status.following:        print(&quot;Following!&quot;)        elif status.follow_requested:        print(&quot;Requested to follow!&quot;)```&gt; ### **Note:**&gt; When you create a new sessionid through *NewSessionID()*, it's recommended to save it somewhere, and use the same sessionid (instead of creating a new one each time you need) until it expires or becomes invalid.&gt;&gt; This should be done to avoid unnecessary prolonged wait time while generating a new sessionid and also to prevent getting your account from getting flagged because of repetitive logins.## üìã RememberEvery function should return **None** on failure. So, it's recommended to add an *if statement* before using the actual data to avoid TypeErrors. Here's an example:```pythonfrom ensta import Guestguest = Guest()available = guest.username_availability(&quot;cristiano&quot;)if available is None:  # 'None' indicates failure    print(&quot;Something went wrong.&quot;)else:    print(available)```## ‚ù§Ô∏è DonateIf you wish to help me in the development of Ensta, consider donating:[&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/guidelines/download-assets-sm-1.svg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot;/&gt;](https://buymeacoffee.com/diezo)## DisclaimerThis is a third-party package, and not approved by Instagram.
