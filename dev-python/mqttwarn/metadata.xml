However, ``mqttwarn`` works with ``UTF-8``.In order to switch to ``UTF-8``, please invoke this command beforehand::    $PSDefaultParameterValues['Out-File:Encoding'] = 'utf8'*****Usage*****Running interactively=====================Just launch ``mqttwarn``::    # Run mqttwarn    mqttwarnTo supply a different configuration file or log file, optionally use::    # Define configuration file    export MQTTWARNINI=/etc/mqttwarn/acme.ini    # Define log file    export MQTTWARNLOG=/var/log/mqttwarn.log    # Run mqttwarn    mqttwarnRunning notification plugins============================For debugging, or other purposes, you might want to directly run an individualnotification plugin without the dispatching and transformation machinery of*mqttwarn*.We have you covered. To launch a plugin standalone, those commands will giveyou an idea how to pass relevant information on the command line using JSON::    # Launch &quot;log&quot; service plugin    mqttwarn --plugin=log --options='{&quot;message&quot;: &quot;Hello world&quot;, &quot;addrs&quot;: [&quot;crit&quot;]}'    # Launch &quot;file&quot; service plugin    mqttwarn --plugin=file --options='{&quot;message&quot;: &quot;Hello world\n&quot;, &quot;addrs&quot;: [&quot;/tmp/mqttwarn.err&quot;]}'    # Launch &quot;pushover&quot; service plugin    mqttwarn --plugin=pushover --options='{&quot;title&quot;: &quot;About&quot;, &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Hello world&quot;, &quot;addrs&quot;: [&quot;userkey&quot;, &quot;token&quot;], &quot;priority&quot;: 6}'    # Launch &quot;ssh&quot; service plugin from the command line    mqttwarn --plugin=ssh --config='{&quot;host&quot;: &quot;ssh.example.org&quot;, &quot;port&quot;: 22, &quot;user&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;}' --options='{&quot;addrs&quot;: [&quot;command with substitution %s&quot;], &quot;payload&quot;: &quot;{\&quot;args\&quot;: \&quot;192.168.0.1\&quot;}&quot;}'    # Launch &quot;cloudflare_zone&quot; service plugin from &quot;mqttwarn-contrib&quot;, passing &quot;--config&quot; parameters via command line    pip install mqttwarn-contrib    mqttwarn --plugin=mqttwarn_contrib.services.cloudflare_zone --config='{&quot;auth-email&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;auth-key&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;}' --options='{&quot;addrs&quot;: [&quot;0815&quot;, &quot;www.example.org&quot;, &quot;&quot;], &quot;message&quot;: &quot;192.168.0.1&quot;}'    # Submit notification to &quot;ntfy&quot;, using Apprise service plugin.    mqttwarn --plugin=apprise \        --config='{&quot;baseuri&quot;: &quot;ntfy://user:password@ntfy.example.org/topic1/topic2&quot;}' \        --options='{&quot;addrs&quot;: [], &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Example notification&quot;, &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Hello world&quot;}'Also, the ``--config-file`` parameter can be used to optionally specify thepath to a configuration file.Running as system daemon========================- We recommend to use Supervisor_ for running *mqttwarn* as a service, see also `supervisor.ini`_.- Alternatively, have a look at `mqttwarn.service`_, the systemd unit configuration file for *mqttwarn*.Running in a development sandbox================================For hacking_ on mqttwarn, please install it in development mode.****************Acknowledgements****************Thanks to all the contributors of *mqttwarn* who got their hands dirty with itand helped to co-create and conceive it in one way or another. You know who you are.*******************Project information*******************About=====These links will guide you to the source code of *mqttwarn* and its documentation.- `mqttwarn on GitHub &lt;https://github.com/jpmens/mqttwarn&gt;`_- `mqttwarn on the Python Package Index (PyPI) &lt;https://pypi.org/project/mqttwarn/&gt;`_- `mqttwarn documentation &lt;https://github.com/jpmens/mqttwarn/tree/main/doc&gt;`_Requirements============You will need at least the following components:* Python 3.x or PyPy 3.x.* An MQTT broker. We recommend Mosquitto_.* Some more Python modules to satisfy service dependencies defined in the ``setup.py`` file.Contributing============We are always happy to receive code contributions, ideas, suggestionsand problem reports from the community.So, if you'd like to contribute you're most welcome.Spend some time taking a look around, locate a bug, design issue orspelling mistake and then send us a pull request or create an `issue`_.Thanks in advance for your efforts, we really appreciate any help or feedback.There are also some extensions to mqttwarn not included in the core package.Yet, they are bundled into another package, ``mqttwarn-contrib``, see also`community contributions to mqttwarn`_.Licenses========This software is copyright Â© 2014-2023 Jan-Piet Mens and contributors.
