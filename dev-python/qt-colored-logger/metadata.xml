However, the standard libraries do not provide exactly what I need... Therefore, I decided to make my own library! Which will implement the functionality I need.I was inspired by the [colored-logs](https://pypi.org/project/colored-logs/) library.- [Content](#content)## OverviewThe library implements the formation of a beautifully formatted colored text, similar to a log, which has all the necessary information:- Device name and registered profile, system name, etc. (this data is displayed only once at the beginning of the logging)- Log entry time- Log entry status- Description of the log entry status- Log entry type- Entry messageAny information to the output can be turned off (according to the default, everything is included). It is also possible to change the output settings during the logging process. It is possible to change the colors of the foreground text and the background.- [Content](#content)## Important releases&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;See the important releases (possible spoilers)&lt;/summary&gt;- [x] v0.1.0 - First official release (complete basic HTML logger)- [x] v0.2.0 - Structural update (added basic console logger with HTML base)- [x] v0.3.0 - Background update (added background for log entries)- [x] v0.4.0 - Buffer update (added text buffer)- [x] v0.5.0 - PROJECT NAME CHANGED!!!ATTENTION!!!

In connection with the increase in capabilities and functionality, the library has changed its name! It is now called [Mighty Logger](https://pypi.org/project/mighty-logger/). This repository **is no longer maintained by the author**!To install the library, enter the command:```shpip install qt-colored-logger```## UsageThis is the simplest example of using the library:```pythonfrom qt_colored_logger.text import TextBufferfrom qt_colored_logger.logger import Loggerif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:buf = TextBuffer(115)logger = Logger(program_name=&quot;Test&quot;, text_buffer=buf)logger.MESSAGE(status_message_text=&quot;OK&quot;, message_text=&quot;Outputting the message&quot;)```The outputs in console will contain the following text (GitHub, PyPi and possibly some other sites do not support displaying colors in Markdown - use resources that support them, such as PyCharm):&gt; &lt;span style='background-color: #;'&gt;&lt;span style='color: #ffd700;'&gt;-Test?entry&gt; $███████████████^████@███████:██████████:█████:█████████:█████&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;span style='background-color: #;'&gt;&lt;span style='color: #b0e0e6;'&gt;-?entry&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color: #da70d6;'&gt;*2023-04-09 12:37:07.198496 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color: #ffa500;'&gt;#STATUS: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color: #ff8c00;'&gt;OK &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color: #afeeee;'&gt;@MESSAGE - &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color: #b0e0e6;'&gt;Outputting the message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;See the USAGING.md file for more details.- [Content](#content)## ~~Additional functionality~~!!!ATTENTION!!!
