Dare I say, enrollment science tools?&gt; WARNING:  This is a very young project with exploration around the API and the toolkits included.## Install and Test NotesInstallation of `pypeds` is as simple as `pip install pypeds`.  It is highly recommended that you leverage the use of environments when coding in python; at least that is my opinion anyway.  I prefer to use conda for my environment management.  Assuming that you have conda setup properly, this could be as simple as:```conda create -n pypeds python=3.6conda activate pypedspip install pypeds```Alternatively, if you want to use the development version of this package, you can review [this Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YxnfdZyr1JD9EQlbf32HN9bpXiitAlaM) which provides an installation overview to install from this repository.  You can replicate this process anytime you want code/analyze data using Google's fantastic notebook coding environment.Last but not least, it's worth stating that you could just as easily install `pypeds` via collab with:```!pip install pypeds```## Basic UsageThe `years` argument is based on the survey year shown on the IPEDS website.  When the datasets are built, this package adds both the survey year and the fall year (of the academic year) to the datasets.  For example, the survey SFA (Student Financial Aid) for the survey year `2017` is reporting on data for the 1617 academic year, so I include `fall_year` with a value of 2016 in this case.  Below is a simple session to get the last 2 years of the directory information surveys:```from pypeds import ipeds# generate a list of survey years -- this must be a python list# YEARS = list(range(2014, 2018, 1))  ## another way to create a range of yearsYEARS = [2019,2020]# instantiate the survey of interesthd = ipeds.HD(years=YEARS)#  extract, or download the surveyshd.extract()# load the surveys as an explicit pandas dataframe in your sessiondf = hd.load()# confirm that we have the data we expecteddf.survey_year.value_counts()2019.0    65592020.0    6440```This package aims to be a go-to resource for those of us who analyze data in higher education, and perhaps more specifically, enrollment management.  As such, I have chosen an API scheme that hopefully will make your transition to python easier, especially as you transition into machine learning with scikit-learn.  The use of classes and methods is heavily inspired by that toolkit.Moreover, this package attempts to remove the friction of data prep as much as possible.  For that reason, and also borrowing from the tidyverse use of verbs for data munging, the API is built around the idea of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) as well as common Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) concepts.  Below is an outline of the tools1. Instantiate the survey of interest with `ipeds.IC()` or `ipeds.HD()`.  The years argument defaults to the current __survey__ (2017) year but can setup with a __list__ of years.  For example, `ipeds.HD(years=[2016,2017])` as well.2. Next, we `.extract` the data, which collects 1 or more years of full survey datasets from IPEDS and keeps the data within our survey object.3. Optionally, you can `.transform` the data.  This will supply functionality to modify the survey data by filtering rows, selecting columns, or deriving new columns using __commonly accepted logic__ in order to establish standard definitions.  Again, the aim is to make things easier.4. Lastly, `.load` pulls out the survey datasets as a pandas dataframe, at which point you can analyze, visualize the survey dataset using the full suite of data analytics tools found within python.This package is under heavy development and as noted at the top, is subject to breaking changes within the API.  However, beyond the ETL verbs, this package will also include various methods for exploration, competitive benchmarking, and data visualization.  While all of this work can be done by the analyst after the `.load` method, the aim is facilitate learning and insight by extracting away the &quot;how&quot; for basic and common questions in the enrollment management space.## Surveys currently supported:- HD: Directory Info [HD]- IC: Institutional Characteristics, which also merges on the ADM survey which started in 2014 [IC]- SFA: Student Financial Aid [SFA]- EF_C: Residence and Migration of First-Time Freshmen [EFC]- EF_D: Total entering class, retention rates, and student-to-faculty ratio [EFD]- IC_AY: Charges for Academic Year Programs [ICAY]- C_A: Awards/degrees conferred by program (6-digit CIP code), award level, race/ethnicity, and gender [C_A]- OM: Award and enrollment data at four, six and eight years of entering degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate cohorts [OM]- FF1: Finance, Public institutions - GASB [FF1]- FF2: Private not-for-profit institutions or Public institutions using FASB [FF2]The class names are in the brackets.  For example, the `EF_C` survey can be instantiated using `ipeds.EFC()`.## Additional datasetsThis package will also periodically add datasets that one might use when studying and analyzing data in higher education and enrollment management.Most notably, once importing the `datasets` module, `pypeds` attempts to provide simple access to core education-related datasets.  For example:- `wiche`  for data, and projections, of high school graduates in the US by state.- In addition to above, there are other datasets to help with mapping code and geographies for easier reporting and visualization.For example, let's play around with the WICHE projections below.### WICHE High School ProjectionsFor example, you might want to look at the [WICHE projections for High School Graduates](https://knocking.wiche.edu/data).  The data are currently included in this package via the datasets module.```# import the datasets modulefrom pypeds import datasets# extract the wiche datasetwiche = datasets.wiche()   # first few rowswiche.head(1).T                                                    0stabbr                                             _Mschoolyear                                    2000-01raceethnicity           American Indian/Alaska Nativegradelevel                                    Grade 1schoolsector                           Public Schoolsprojection                            Reported/Actualstudents                                         5106statename                                     Midwestregion_wiche                                  Midwestregion_census_division                            NaNregion_census                                     NaN```You will notice that the data are not wide, but long.  This is by design, and it allows us to reshape and aggregate as desired.For example, plot the  `actual` and `projected` (the projection column) total high school graduates (gradelevel and raceethnicity columns) in the dataset.```# isolate total grads, but still for each state and yearall_grads = wiche.loc[(wiche.gradelevel=='Graduates') &amp; (wiche.raceethnicity=='Total') &amp; (wiche.statename == 'United States') &amp; (wiche.schoolsector == 'Grand Total Public &amp; Private'), : ]# you will notice that we have to filter the dataset to get total US high school grads, but it highlights the resolution of the data!# generate the line plotall_grads.plot(x=&quot;schoolyear&quot;, y=&quot;students&quot;, kind=&quot;line&quot;)```&lt;img src=&quot;https://snipboard.io/x1ZOU4.jpg&quot;&gt;## Future work- include tooling to help analysts connect to Salesforce or Data Warehouses/Databases- submit via pypeds- additional higher education datasets- Pull in Wikipedia links and pageview trends## Notes1.  It appears that the mission statement data is not part of the full surveys, _but_ is included in the MS Access version.  Obviously it's less than ideal that the data collected is not included within the full file option, which this package highly leverages.## Resources:[IPEDS survey info](https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/VisImpSpecView.aspx?id=33&amp;show=all&amp;instid=508)</longdescription>
