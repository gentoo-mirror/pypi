	<longdescription># Welcome to rx![rx](https://www.run-rx.com) is a command-line tool to make remote executioneasy. It integrates with whatever tools you're currently using and gives you along-running VM in the cloud that is kept in sync with your local machine.## InstallationInstall via pip:    pip install run-rxrx also requires rsync to run, make sure you have it installed:    which rsyncIf not, check out [its website](https://rsync.samba.org/download.html) or yourfavorite package manager to install.## UsageIn the directory containing your project (often your git root), run:    rx initThis will prompt you to log in (or create an account) and allocate a machinein the cloud for you to use. Then it will copy your project from your localmachine to the cloud instance and install any packages that your project needs.It may take several minutes to allocate a machine, copy your source code, andinstall packages (depending on your project).Once rx finishes initializing, you can run any command on your remote workerby prefixing it with &quot;rx&quot;:    rx python my-script.py    rx ps ax    rx 'echo $PATH &gt; my-path.txt'Check out the [getting-started](https://www.run-rx.com/getting-started/)section for more examples.## What rx doesWhen you run rx it takes care of a bunch of cloud setup tasks on your behalf:* It creates a private hosted environment for your project in the cloud.* It copies your source code into that environment.* It installs any dependencies your project needs.Then, every time you run a command, it automatically syncs local changes toyour cloud instance and syncs outputs back to your local machine. rx hostsyour environment on our own cloud instances, so you never have to worry aboutsetup or teardown.Check out the [getting started](https://www.run-rx.com/getting-started) guideto start using rx in less than five minutes.*Note: the `rx` binary is a thin client and does not run commands on your localmachine: it sends them to your cloud instance and runs them there.*Right now rx is free to use, so please give it a try and [let us know](mailto:eng@run-rx.com) what you think!## FeedbackFeel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/run-rx/rx/issues) if you haveany questions or problems!## Running testsRun tests with:```pip install -r requirements_dev.txtpython run_tests.py```</longdescription>
