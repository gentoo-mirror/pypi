You can also discuss your ideas andqueries with the community in[fpm discussions](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/discussions),or more broadly on [Fortran-Lang Discourse](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/).Fortran Package Manager is not to be confused with[Jordan Sissel's fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm), a more general,non-Fortran related package manager.**Website: &lt;https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/&gt;**## [Download](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/en/install/index.html)Fpm is available on many platforms and through multiple package managers, see our Documentationwebpage for a list of **[All Supported Installations](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/en/install/index.html)**.The easiest installation routes are shown below.### [Python PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/fpm/)Fpm is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fpm/), and can be installed with:```shpip install fpm```### [Binary](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/releases)Binaries for the latest stable release are available [to download](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/releases/latest) for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.**Note:** On Linux and MacOS, you will need to enable executable permission before you can use the binary._e.g._ `$ chmod u+x fpm-0.6.0-linux-x86_64`The binaries at the [current tag](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/releases/tag/current) are updated automatically to always provide the current git version from the default branch.### [Conda]Fpm is available on [conda-forge], to add `conda-forge` to your channels use:```shconda config --add channels conda-forge```Fpm can be installed with:```shconda create -n fpm fpmconda activate fpm```The conda package manager can be installed from [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases)or from [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).[Conda]: https://conda.io[conda-forge]: https://conda-forge.org/### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)The Fortran Package Manager (fpm) is available for the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager via an additional tap.To install fpm via brew, include the new tap and install using```shbrew tap fortran-lang/fortranbrew install fpm```Binary distributions are available for MacOS 11 (Catalina) and 12 (Big Sur) for x86_64 architectures. For other platforms fpm will be built locally from source automatically.Fpm should be available and functional after those steps.For more details checkout the tap [here](https://github.com/fortran-lang/homebrew-fortran).## [Get started](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/en/tutorial/index.html)**Follow our [Quickstart Tutorial](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/en/tutorial/hello-fpm.html) to get familiar with fpm**.### Start a new projectCreating a new *fpm* project is as simple as running the command`fpm new project_name`. This will create a new folder in your current directorywith the following contents and initialized as a git repository.* `fpm.toml` – with your project’s name and some default standard meta-data* `README.md` – with your project’s name* `.gitignore`* `src/project_name.f90` – with a simple hello world subroutine* `app/main.f90` (if `--app` flag used) – a program that calls the subroutine* `test/main.f90` (if `--test` flag used) – an empty test program### Building your Fortran project with fpm*fpm* understands the basic commands:* `fpm build` – build your library, executables and tests* `fpm run` – run executables* `fpm test` – run tests* `fpm install` - installs the executables locallyThe command `fpm run` can optionally accept the name of the specific executableto run, as can `fpm test`; like `fpm run specific_executable`. Command linearguments can also be passed to the executable(s) or test(s) with the option`-- some arguments`.See additional instructions in the [Packaging guide](PACKAGING.md) orthe [manifest reference](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/en/spec/manifest.html).&lt;!-- ### Bootstrapping instructionsThis guide explains the process of building *fpm* on a platform for the first time.To build *fpm* without a prior *fpm* version a single source file version is availableat each release.To build manually using the single source distribution, run the following code (from within the current directory)```shmkdir _tmpcurl -LJ https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/releases/download/current/fpm.F90 &gt; _tmp/fpm.F90gfortran -J _tmp _tmp/fpm.F90 -o _tmp/fpm_tmp/fpm install --flag &quot;-g -fbacktrace -O3&quot;rm -r _tmp```To automatically bootstrap using this appoach run the install script```sh./install.sh``` --&gt;## Environmental variablesThe table below lists the environment variables that control `fpm`'s choice of compilers, compiler flags, archiver locations, and link flags, each of which can be overridden by passing `fpm` flags also shown in the table.| Environment Variable | Defines               | Overridden by    || :------------------- | :-------------------- | :--------------- || `FPM_FC`             | Fortran compiler path | `--compiler`     || `FPM_CC`             | C compiler path       | `--c-compiler`   || `FPM_CXX`            | C++ compiler path     | `--cxx-compiler` || `FPM_FFLAGS`         | Fortran compiler flags| `--flag`         || `FPM_CFLAGS`         | C compiler flags      | `--c-flag`       || `FPM_CXXFLAGS`       | C++ compiler flags    | `--cxx-flag`     || `FPM_AR`             | Archiver path         | `--archiver`     || `FPM_LDFLAGS`        | Link flags            | `--link-flag`    |</longdescription>
