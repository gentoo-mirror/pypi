	<longdescription># Wild BitsSimple editor for BOTW file formats## SetupRequires the latest (2019) Visual C++ redistributable for x64, downloadable [here](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).Install Python 3.7+ (**64-bit version**), then run `pip install wildbits`.## UsageTo run Wild Bits, type `wildbits` into your command console. Alternatively, run `python -m wildbits`.Wild Bits can edit most of the commonly modded, non-graphical file types in*The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, including SARC archives, the[Resource Size Table](https://zeldamods.org/wiki/Resource_system#Resource_size_table)(RSTB), and BYML, AAMP, and MSBT files. Most of the formats are handled by thepowerful and reliable [oead](https://github.com/zeldamods/oead) library, whichensures accuracy and compatibility with the game.General usage notes: Wild Bits handles yaz0 compression/decompressionautomatically. Yaz0 compressed files are automatically decompressed, and whensaving Wild Bits will determine whether to yaz0 compress based on whether thefile extension has the additonal `.s` prefix. Big/little endian differences arealso mostly handled automatically.### SARC Editor![SARC editor preview](https://i.imgur.com/iRG9HYf.png)*Preview of SARC editor*The SARC editor allows you to edit SARC files, e.g. `.sbactorpack`, `.pack`,`.ssarc`, etc. Once opened, the file contents will be displayed as tree view.Nested SARCs expand like folders and will be automatically repacked correctly.You can extract all files, update the contents from a source folder, add newfiles, or extract/rename/delete any individual file in the SARC. File typessupported by the YAML editor can also be edited directly and saved to the openSARC. Recognized BOTW files in the SARC which have been modified from the stockcopies are highlighted in yellow for easy identification.### RSTB Editor![RSTB editor preview](https://i.imgur.com/fS8zVnt.png)*Preview of RSTB editor*The RSTB editor can open a BOTW resource size table file, usually named`ResourceSizeTable.product.srsizetable`. It lists all of the resource entrieswith the option to edit or delete them. You can also add new entries. Whenadding or editing an entry, you have the option to calculate the correct valueby providing the resource file. Resource types that cannot be calculated orestimated will return &quot;0&quot; from the calculator.To find a specific entry, you can filter the list with the search box at thebottom of the UI, or you can use the Search button. The filter box will searchany part of a file name, whereas the Search button requires an exact resourcepath.If you cannot find an expected resource, note that entries for files not knownfrom BOTW will appear as &quot;Unknown&quot; with their hash to identify them. Entriesadded by Wild Bits will be added to a list of recognized names, and so will fullpaths provided to the Search function (*not* the filter box).### YAML Editor![YAML editor preview](https://i.imgur.com/AamxY5Q.png)*Preview of the YAML editor*Other formats that Wild Bits supports, namely BYML, AAMP, and MSBT, are editedusing the YAML editor. It works as a normal text/code editor but automaticallyhandles conversion between the binary formats and YAML representation. Basicautocomplete is also provided.## Known IssuesWith some system configurations, the `wildbits` command does not work properly,and the app must be launched with `python -m wildbits`.## Building from SourceBuilding from source requires, in *addition* to the general prerequisites:-   Node.js v14-   The following Python packages:    -   botw-utils &gt;= 0.2.2    -   oead &gt;= 1.1.1    -   rstb &gt;= 1.2.0    -   pymsyt &gt;= 0.1.5    -   xxhash ~= 1.4.3    -   pywebview ~= 3.2To build from source, you will first need to prepare the webpack bundle. Enterthe `bcml/assets` folder, run `npm install` to collect dependencies, and thenrun `npm build` or `npm test`.Finally, back at the root folder, you can install using`python setup.py install`. You can also run without installing by using `python -m bcml`.</longdescription>
