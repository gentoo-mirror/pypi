(2014)&lt;/a&gt;, with the edge cases for BLANC taken from&lt;a href=&quot;recasens2011BLANC&quot;&gt;Recasens and Hovy (2011)&lt;/a&gt;.---&lt;sub&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;footnote-0-1&quot; href=&quot;#footnote-0-1-backref&quot;&gt;1.&lt;/a&gt; **S**corer for **cor**eference **ch**ains.&lt;/sub&gt;[ref-scorer]: https://github.com/conll/reference-coreference-scorers## Usage```bashscorch gold.json sys.json out.txt```## InstallFrom the cheeseshop```bashpython3 -m pip install --user scorch```Or directly from git```bashpython3 -m pip install --user git+https://github.com/LoicGrobol/scorch.git```## Formats### Single documentThe input files should be JSON files with a `&quot;type&quot;` key at top-level- If `&quot;type&quot;` is `&quot;graph&quot;`, then top-level should have at top-level  - A `&quot;mentions&quot;` key containing a list of all mention identifiers  - A `&quot;links&quot;` key containing a list of pairs of corefering mention identifiers- If `&quot;type&quot;` is `&quot;clusters&quot;`, then top-level should have a `&quot;clusters&quot;` key containing a mapping  from clusters ids to cluster contents (as lists of mention identifiers).Of course the system and gold files should use the same set of mention identifiers for the mentionsthey have in common.For convenience, the [`conll.py`](/scorch/conll.py) converts CoNLL-2012 files to this format.### Multiple documentsIf the inputs are directories, files with the same base name (excluding extension) as those presentin the sys directory are expected to be present in the gold directory, with exactly one gold filefor each sys file.In that case, the output scores will be the micro-average of the individual filesscores, ie their arithmetic means weighted by the relative numbers of- Gold mentions for Recall- System mentions for Precision- The sum of the previous two for F₁This is different from the reference interpretation where- **MUC** weighting ignores mentions in singleton entities  - This should not make any difference for the CoNLL-2012 dataset, since singleton entities are not    annotated.  - For datasets with singletons, the shortcomings of MUC are well known, so this score shouldn't    matter much- **BLANC** is calculated by micro-averaging coreference and non-coreference separately, using  the number of links as weights instead of the number of mentions.  - This is roughly equivalent to weighting coreference scores per document by their number of    non-singleton clusters and non-coreference scores by the square of their number of mentions.    This give disproportionate importance to large documents, which is not desirable    in heterogenous corporaThe CoNLL average score is the arithmetic mean of the global MUC, B³ and CEAFₑ F₁ scores.## Sources- &lt;a id=&quot;pradhan2014scoring&quot; /&gt;**Scoring Coreference Partitions of Predicted Mentions: A Reference  Implementation.** Sameer Pradhan, Xiaoqiang Luo, Marta Recasens, Eduard Hovy, Vincent Ng and  Michael Strube. *Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational  Linguistics*, Baltimore, MD, June 2014.
