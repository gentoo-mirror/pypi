Currently, the library offers a set of techniques to easily measure and mitigate Bias across numerous tasks. In the future, it will be extended to include tools for Efficacy, Robustness, Privacy and Explainability as well. This will allow a holistic assessment of AI systems.  - Documentation: https://holistic-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/- Tutorials: https://github.com/holistic-ai/holisticai/tree/main/tutorials- Source code: https://github.com/holistic-ai/holisticai/tree/main- Holistic Ai website: https://holisticai.com# Installation:For metrics, you can use the default installation:```bashpip install holisticai```For bias visualization and mitigation, you need additional dependencies. You can install them with: ```bashpip install holisticai[methods]```## Troubleshootingon **macOS** could be necessary some packages before install holisticai library:```bashbrew install cbc pkg-configpython -m pip install cylpbrew install cmake```## ContributingWe welcome contributions to the Holistic AI library.
