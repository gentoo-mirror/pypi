	<longdescription># JPConvertJPConvert is a preprocessor for Jupyter Notebooks. It may be used to split up Jupyter Notebooks based on macros,automatically set options, embed images and remove unnecessary metadata.## Quick StartInstall JPConvert:```bashpip install jpconvert```Imagine two code cells inside your notebook:```python#jp-solutiona = a + 1``````python#jp-practicea = ...```If you call JPConvert with the `--practice` option, the first cell is removed and the second cell is kept:```pythona = ...```If you call JPConvert with the `--solution` option, the first cell is kept and the second cell is removed:```pythona = a + 1```If no input file is specified, `stdin` is used instead. If no output file is specified, `stdout` is used instead. It isprobably a good idea to use `nbstripout` with JPConvert to remove embedded output data:```bashpython -m jpconvert input.ipynb --practice | nbstripout &gt; output.ipynb```## SetupThe preferred way to use JPConvert is in a virtual environment:```bashpython -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activate```Use pip to download and install JPConvert. JPConvert requires `requests` and `python-magic` to embed images via HTTP.Both packages are installed automatically by pip.```bashpip install jpconvert```Run JPConvert as a Python module:```bashpython -m jpconvert &lt;input&gt; [&lt;output&gt;] [&lt;options&gt;]```## Usage Guide### Macros and Output TypesJPConvert provides several macros to mark cells for a specific task. Only code cells with the macro matching the outputoptions are kept.| cli option          | description                          ||---------------------|--------------------------------------|| `--practice` / `-p` | keep cells containing `#jp-practice` || `--teaching` / `-t` | keep cells containing `#jp-teaching` || `--solution` / `-s` | keep cells containing `#jp-solution` |Multiple macros can be used per cell. Macros themselves are removed from the code cells.Instead of `#` you can also use `--`. The macros without any prefix can also be added as tags to individual cells.It is also possible to remove any cells without macros. Add `--remove-without-macros` to the command line parametersto activate this behavior.### Empty Cells, Empty Lines, Trailing SpacesJPConvert automatically removes1. trailing spaces from lines,2. empty lines from the end of cells and3. empty cells.This behavior can be disabled using the command line parameters1. `--no-strip-lines`,2. `--keep-trailing` and3. `--keep-empty`.### Readonly and UndeletableJPConvert automatically adds *readonly* and *undeletable* flags to any cells that do not contain `#jp-practice`. If youwant to protect the latter from writing as well, add `#jp-readonly` or use `#jp-practice-ro`. Users may undo thesechanges, but at least they cannot accidentally delete or modify cells.To disable this behavior, the command line parameters `--no-force-readonly` and `--no-set-undeletable` can be used.### Table of ContentsA table of contents is automatically inserted into all cells that contain the macro `#jp-toc`. The entries areautomatically generated from headlines (lines starting with one or multiple `#`) in markdown cells. Each entry consistsof the title and a reference that leads directly to the anchor tag of the heading.Up to two conditionals can be added to control the table's depth. It uses the level of the heading (number of `#`) forfiltering. The following example shows how to create a table of contents from level 2 to 5.```python#jp-toc&gt;=2&lt;6```### Embedding ImagesImages can be embedded in markdown cells via the Jupyter user interface. JPConvert automatically embeds linked filesfrom both local disk and HTTP(S) sources, which simplifies notebook editing. Supported file types are `png`, `jpg` and`svg`.JPConvert also embeds files that are displayed using HTML tags. These provide the ability to scale graphics as desired,while in markdown the size is determined only by the resolution.Add the command line parameter `--no-embed-images` to disable this behavior.</longdescription>
