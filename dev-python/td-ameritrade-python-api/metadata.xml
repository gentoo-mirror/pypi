API Keys, consumer IDs, andredirect URIs are generated from the TD Ameritrade developer portal. To set up and createyour TD Ameritrade developer account, please refer tothe [official documentation](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/content/phase-1-authentication-update-xml-based-api).Additionally, to authenticate yourself using this library, you will need to provide youraccount number and password for your main TD Ameritrade account.**Important:** Your account number, an account password, consumer ID, and API key shouldbe kept secret.## InstallationThe project can be found at PyPI, if you'd like to view the project please usethis [link](https://pypi.org/project/td-ameritrade-python-api/).```bashpip install td-ameritrade-python-api```To upgrade the library run the following command:```bashpip install --upgrade td-ameritrade-python-api```## UsageThis example demonstrates how to login to the API and demonstrates sending a requestusing the `get_quotes` endpoint, using your API key.**Credentials:**Please note, that the `credentials_path` is a file path that will house the credentialslike your refresh token and access token. You must specify the `credentials_path` argumentyourself so that you are aware of where the tokens will be stored. For example, if youspecify the `credentials_path` as `C:\Users\Public\Credentials\td_state.json` it wouldstore your tokens in a JSON file located in a folder called Credentials located underthe Users profile.```python# Import the clientfrom td.client import TDClient# Create a new session, credentials path is required.TDSession = TDClient(    client_id='&lt;CLIENT_ID&gt;',    redirect_uri='&lt;REDIRECT_URI&gt;',    credentials_path='&lt;PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_FILE&gt;')# Login to the sessionTDSession.login()# Grab real-time quotes for 'MSFT' (Microsoft)msft_quotes = TDSession.get_quotes(instruments=['MSFT'])# Grab real-time quotes for 'AMZN' (Amazon) and 'SQ' (Square)multiple_quotes = TDSession.get_quotes(instruments=['AMZN','SQ'])```## Features### Authentication Workflow SupportAutomatically will handle the authentication workflow for new users, returning users, and userswith expired tokens (refresh token or access token).### Request ValidationFor certain requests, in a limited fashion, it will help validate your request when possible.For example, when using the `get_movers` endpoint, it will automatically validate that themarket you're requesting data from is one of the valid options.### Customized Objects for Watchlists, Orders, and Option ChainsRequests for saved orders, regular orders, watchlists, and option chains can be a challengingprocess that has multiple opportunities to make mistakes. This library has built-in objectsthat will allow you to quickly build your request and then validate certain portions of yourrequest when possible.### Library RequirementsThe following requirements must be met before being able to use the TD Ameritrade Python API library.- You must have a TD Ameritrade Account.- You must have a TD Ameritrade Developer Account. Please go to following [folder](https://github.com/areed1192/td-ameritrade-python-api/tree/master/samples/resources)  for instructions on how to create a Developer account.## Documentation and Resources### Official API Documentation- [Getting Started](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/content/phase-1-authentication-update-xml-based-api)- [Endpoints](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/apis)- [Guides](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/guides)- [Samples - Price History](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/content/price-history-samples)- [Samples - Place Order](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/content/place-order-samples)### Unofficial Documentation- [TD Ameritrade API - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcFcktZ0wnNnKvxFkJ5B7pvGaGa81Ny-6)## Support these Projects**Patreon:**Help support this project and future projects by donating to my [Patreon Page](https://www.patreon.com/sigmacoding).I'm always looking to add more content for individuals like yourself, unfortuantely some of the APIs I would requireme to pay monthly fees.**YouTube:**If you'd like to watch more of my content, feel free to visit my YouTube channel [Sigma Coding](https://www.youtube.com/c/SigmaCoding).**Hire Me:**If you have a project, you think I can help you with feel free to reach out at [coding.sigma@gmail.com](mailto:coding.sigma@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Project%20Proposal) or fill out the [contract request form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=ZwOBErInsUGliXx0Yo2VfcCSWZSwW25Es3vPV2veU0pUMUs5MUc2STkzSzVQMFNDVlI5NjJVNjREUi4u)## Authentication Workflow**Step 1 - Start the Script:**While in Visual Studio Code, right click anywhere in the code editor while in the file that contains your code.The following dropdown will appear:![Terminal Dropdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/areed1192/td-ameritrade-python-api/master/samples/instructions/photos/terminal_dropdown.jpg &quot;Terminal Dropdown&quot;)From the dropdown, click `Run Python file in Terminal`, this will start the python script.**Step 2 - Go to Redirect URL:**The TD Library will automatically generate the redirect URL that will navigate you to the TD website for foryou authentication. You can either copy the link and paste it into a browser manually or if you're using VisualStudio Code you can press `CTRL + Click` to have Visual Studio Code navigate you to the URL immeditately.![Redirect URI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/areed1192/td-ameritrade-python-api/master/samples/instructions/photos/redirect_uri.jpg &quot;Redirect URI&quot;)**Step 3 - Login to the TD API:**Once you've arrived at the login screen, you'll need to provide your credentials to authenticate the session.Please provide your Account Username and Account Password in the userform and then press enter. As a reminderthese, are the same username/password combination you use to login to your regular TD Account.![&quot;TD Login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/areed1192/td-ameritrade-python-api/master/samples/instructions/photos/td_login.jpg &quot;TD Login&quot;)**Step 4 - Accept the Terms:**Accept the Terms of the API by clicking `Allow`, this will redirect you.![TD Terms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/areed1192/td-ameritrade-python-api/master/samples/instructions/photos/td_terms.jpg &quot;TD Terms&quot;)**Step 5 - Copy the Authorization Code:**After accepting the terms, you'll be taken to the URL that you provided as your `redirect URI`. However, atthe end of that URL will be `authorization code`. To complete the authentication workflow, copy the URL asit appears below. Don't worry if the numbers don't match, as you will have a different code.![Auth Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/areed1192/td-ameritrade-python-api/master/samples/instructions/photos/auth_code.jpg &quot;Auth Code&quot;)**Step 6 - Paste the Authorization Code in the Terminal:**Take the URL and copy it into the Terminal, after you have pasted it, press `Enter`. The authentication workflowwill complete and the script will start running. At this stage, we are exchanging your authorization code foran access token. That access token is valid only for 30 minutes. However, a refresh token is also stored thatwill refresh your access token when it expires.![Paste URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/areed1192/td-ameritrade-python-api/master/samples/instructions/photos/paste_url.jpg &quot;Paste URL&quot;)After, that the script should run. Additionally, if you go to the location you specified in the `credentials_path`arugment you will now see `td_state.json` file. This file contains all the info used during a session. PleaseDO NOT DELETE THIS FILE OR ELSE YOU WILL NEED TO GO THROUGH THE STEPS ABOVE.</longdescription>
