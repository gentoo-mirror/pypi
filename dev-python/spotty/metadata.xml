Prepare a `spotty.yaml` file and put it to the root directory of your project:   - See the file specification [here](https://spotty.cloud/docs/user-guide/configuration-file.html).   - Read [this](https://medium.com/@apls/how-to-train-deep-learning-models-on-aws-spot-instances-using-spotty-8d9e0543d365)    article for a real-world example.2. Start an instance:    ```bash    $ spotty start    ```    It will run a Spot Instance, restore snapshots if any, synchronize the project with the running instance     and start the Docker container with the environment.3. Train a model or run notebooks.    To connect to the running container via SSH, use the following command:    ```bash    $ spotty sh    ```    It runs a [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) session, so you can always detach this session using    __`Ctrl + b`__, then __`d`__ combination of keys. To be attached to that session later, just use the    `spotty sh` command again.    Also, you can run your custom scripts inside the Docker container using the `spotty run &lt;SCRIPT_NAME&gt;` command. Read more    about custom scripts in the documentation:     [Configuration: &quot;scripts&quot; section](https://spotty.cloud/docs/configuration-file/#scripts-section-optional).## ContributionsAny feedback or contributions are welcome!
