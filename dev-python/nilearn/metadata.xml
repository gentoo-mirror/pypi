It provides statistical and machine-learning tools, with instructive documentation &amp; friendly community.It supports general linear model (GLM) based analysis and leverages the `scikit-learn &lt;https://scikit-learn.org&gt;`_ Python toolbox for multivariate statistics with applications such as predictive modelling, classification, decoding, or connectivity analysis.Important links===============- Official source code repo: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/- HTML documentation (stable release): https://nilearn.github.io/Install=======Latest release--------------**1. Setup a virtual environment**We recommend that you install ``nilearn`` in a virtual Python environment,either managed with the standard library ``venv`` or with ``conda``(see `miniconda &lt;https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html&gt;`_ for instance).Either way, create and activate a new python environment.With ``venv``:.. code-block:: bash    python3 -m venv /&lt;path_to_new_env&gt;    source /&lt;path_to_new_env&gt;/bin/activateWindows users should change the last line to ``\&lt;path_to_new_env&gt;\Scripts\activate.bat`` in order to activate their virtual environment.With ``conda``:.. code-block:: bash    conda create -n nilearn python=3.9    conda activate nilearn**2. Install nilearn with pip**Execute the following command in the command prompt / terminalin the proper python environment:.. code-block:: bash    python -m pip install -U nilearnDevelopment version-------------------Please find all development setup instructions in the`contribution guide &lt;https://nilearn.github.io/stable/development.html#setting-up-your-environment&gt;`_.Check installation------------------Try importing nilearn in a python / iPython session:.. code-block:: python    import nilearnIf no error is raised, you have installed nilearn correctly.Drop-in Hours=============The Nilearn team organizes regular online drop-in hours to answer questions,discuss feature requests, or have any Nilearn-related discussions. Nilearndrop-in hours occur *every Wednesday from 4pm to 5pm UTC*, and we make sure that atleast one member of the core-developer team is available. These events are heldon `Jitsi Meet &lt;https://meet.jit.si/nilearn-drop-in-hours&gt;`_ and are fully open,anyone is welcome to join!For more information and ways to engage with the Nilearn team see`How to get help &lt;https://nilearn.github.io/stable/development.html#how-to-get-help&gt;`_.Dependencies============The required dependencies to use the software are listed in the file `pyproject.toml &lt;https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/main/pyproject.toml&gt;`_.If you are using nilearn plotting functionalities or running the examples, matplotlib &gt;= 3.3.0 is required.Some plotting functions in Nilearn support both matplotlib and plotly as plotting engines.In order to use the plotly engine in these functions, you will need to install both plotly and kaleido, which can both be installed with pip and anaconda.If you want to run the tests, you need pytest &gt;= 6.0.0 and pytest-cov for coverage reporting.Development===========Detailed instructions on how to contribute are available athttp://nilearn.github.io/stable/development.html</longdescription>
