	<longdescription>## Typing stubs for invokeThis is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)type stub package for the [`invoke`](https://github.com/pyinvoke/invoke) package.It can be used by type-checking tools like[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses`invoke`.This version of `types-invoke` aims to provide accurate annotationsfor `invoke==2.0.*`.The source for this package can be found athttps://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/invoke. All fixes fortypes and metadata should be contributed there.*Note:* The `invoke` package includes type annotations or type stubssince version 2.1.2. Please uninstall the `types-invoke`package if you use this or a newer version.This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.This package was generated from typeshed commit `35873ec3d874d3974edad0cc398b748d6dcef711` and was testedwith mypy 1.6.1, pyright 1.1.332, andpytype 2023.10.17.</longdescription>
