Bos, Computational Linguistics 42(3), 2016](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/COLI_a_00257). Thank you to [@jobos](https://github.com/jobos) for the paper!## Installation```pip install amr-logic-converter```## UsageThis library parses an AMR tree into first-order logic statements. An example of this is shown below:```pythonfrom amr_logic_converter import AmrLogicConverterconverter = AmrLogicConverter()AMR = &quot;&quot;&quot;(x / boy    :ARG0-of (e / giggle-01        :polarity -))&quot;&quot;&quot;logic = converter.convert(AMR)print(logic)# boy(x) ^ ¬(:ARG0(e, x) ^ giggle-01(e))```### Programmatic logic manipulationThe output from the `convert` method can be displayed as a string, but it can also be manipulated in Python. For instance, in the example above, we could also write:```pythonconverter = AmrLogicConverter()AMR = &quot;&quot;&quot;(x / boy    :ARG0-of (e / giggle-01        :polarity -))&quot;&quot;&quot;expr = converter.convert(AMR)type(expr) # &lt;class 'amr_logic_converter.types.And'&gt;expr.args[0] # Atom(predicate=Predicate(symbol='boy', alignment=None), terms=(Constant(value='x', type='instance', alignment=None),))```### Working with alignment markersThis library will parse alignment markers from AMR using the [penman library](https://penman.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and will include [Alignment](https://penman.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/penman.surface.html#penman.surface.Alignment) objects from penman in `Predicate` and `Const` objects when available. For example, we can access alignment markers like below:```pythonconverter = AmrLogicConverter()AMR = &quot;&quot;&quot;(x / boy~1    :ARG0-of (e / giggle-01~3        :polarity -))&quot;&quot;&quot;expr = converter.convert(AMR)expr.args[0].alignment # Alignment((1,))expr.args[1].body.args[1].alignment # Alignment((3,))```### Existentially Quantifying all InstancesIn [&quot;Expressive Power of Abstract Meaning Representations&quot;](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/COLI_a_00257), all instances are wrapped by an existence quantifier. By default `AmrLogicConverter` does not include these as it's likely not useful, but if you'd like to include them as in the paper you can pass the option `existentially_quantify_instances=True` when constructing the `AmrLogicConverter` as below:```pythonconverter = AmrLogicConverter(existentially_quantify_instances=True)AMR = &quot;&quot;&quot;(x / boy    :ARG0-of (e / giggle-01        :polarity -))&quot;&quot;&quot;logic = converter.convert(AMR)print(logic)# ∃X(boy(X) ^ ¬∃E(:ARG0(E, X) ^ giggle-01(E)))```### Coreference HoistingWhen an instance is coreferenced in multiple places in the AMR, it's necessary to hoisting the existential quantification of that variable high enough that it can still wrap all instances of that variable. By default, the existential quantifier will be hoisted to the level of the lowest common ancestor of all nodes in the AMR tree where an instance is coreferenced. However, in [&quot;Expressive Power of Abstract Meaning Representations&quot;](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/COLI_a_00257), these coreferences are instead hoisted to the maximal possible scope, wrapping the entire formula. If you want this behavior, you can specify the option `maximally_hoist_coreferences=True` when creating the `AmrLogicConverter` instance. This is illustrated below:```pythonAMR = &quot;&quot;&quot;(b / bad-07    :polarity -    :ARG1 (e / dry-01        :ARG0 (x / person            :named &quot;Mr Krupp&quot;)        :ARG1 x))&quot;&quot;&quot;# default behavior, hoist only to the lowest common ancestorconverter = AmrLogicConverter(    existentially_quantify_instances=True,)logic = converter.convert(AMR)print(logic)# ¬∃B(bad-07(B) ∧ ∃E(∃X(:ARG1(B, E) ∧ person(X) ∧ :named(X, &quot;Mr Krupp&quot;) ∧ dry-01(E) ∧ :ARG0(E, X) ∧ :ARG1(E, X))))# maximally hoist coferencesconverter = AmrLogicConverter(    existentially_quantify_instances=True,    maximally_hoist_coreferences=True,)logic = converter.convert(AMR)print(logic)# ∃X(¬∃B(bad-07(B) ∧ ∃E(:ARG1(B, E) ∧ dry-01(E) ∧ :ARG0(E, X) ∧ :ARG1(E, X))) ∧ person(X) ∧ :named(X, &quot;Mr Krupp&quot;))```### Using Variables for InstancesIf you want to use variables for each AMR instance instead of constants, you can pass the option `use_variables_for_instances=True` when creating the AmrLogicConverter instance. When `existentially_quantify_instances` is set, variable will always be used for instances regardless of this setting.## Misc Options- By default variables names are capitalized, but you can change this by setting `capitalize_variables=False`.- By default, relations like `:ARG0-of(X, Y)` have their arguments flipped in logic and turned into `:ARG0(Y, X)`. If you don't want this normalization to occur, you can disable this by setting `invert_relations=False`.## ContributingContributions are welcome!
