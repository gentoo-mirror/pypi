	<longdescription>.. _readme:Curator=======Have indices in Elasticsearch? This is the tool for you!Like a museum curator manages the exhibits and collections on display,Elasticsearch Curator helps you curate, or manage your indices.`Curator API Documentation`_----------------------------Curator ships with both an API and a wrapper script (which is actually definedas an entry point).  The API allows you to write your own scripts to accomplishsimilar goals, or even new and different things with the `Curator API`_, andthe `Elasticsearch Python API`_... _Curator API: http://curator.readthedocs.io/.. _Curator API Documentation: `Curator API`_.. _Elasticsearch Python API: http://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/`Curator CLI Documentation`_----------------------------The `Curator CLI Documentation`_ is now a part of the document repository athttp://elastic.co/guide at http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/index.html.. _Curator CLI Documentation: http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/index.html`Getting Started`_------------------.. _Getting Started: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/about.htmlSee the `Installation guide &lt;https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/installation.html&gt;`_and the `command-line usage guide &lt;https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/command-line.html&gt;`_Running ``curator --help`` will also show usage information.Contributing------------* fork the repo* make changes in your fork* add tests to cover your changes (if necessary)* run tests* sign the `CLA &lt;http://elastic.co/contributor-agreement/&gt;`_* send a pull request!To run from source, use the ``run_curator.py`` script in the root directory ofthe project.Running Tests-------------To run the test suite just run ``python setup.py test``When changing code, contributing new code or fixing a bug please make sure youinclude tests in your PR (or mark it as without tests so that someone else canpick it up to add the tests). When fixing a bug please make sure the testactually tests the bug - it should fail without the code changes and pass afterthey're applied (it can still be one commit of course).The tests will try to connect to your local elasticsearch instance and runintegration tests against it. This will delete all the data stored there! Youcan use the env variable ``TEST_ES_SERVER`` to point to a different instance(for example, 'otherhost:9203').Origins-------Curator was first called ``clearESindices.py`` [1]_ and was almost immediatelyrenamed to ``logstash_index_cleaner.py`` [1]_.  After a time it was migratedunder the `logstash &lt;https://github.com/elastic/logstash&gt;`_ repository as``expire_logs``.  Soon thereafter, Jordan Sissel was hired by Elasticsearch, aswas the original author of this tool.  It became Elasticsearch Curator afterthat and is now hosted at `elastic/curator &lt;https://github.com/elastic/curator&gt;`_...
