Tasks are just regular Python functions marked with the``@task()`` decorator. Dependencies are specified with ``@task()`` too.Tasks can be ignored with the ``@task(ignore=True)``. Disabling a taskis an useful feature to have in situations where you have one task thata lot of other tasks depend on and you want to quickly remove it fromthe dependency chains of all the dependent tasks. Note that any taskwhose name starts with an underscore(\ ``_``) will be consideredprivate. Private tasks are not listed in with ``pynt -l``, but they canstill be run with ``pynt _private_task_name``**build.py**------------::    #!/usr/bin/python    import sys    from pynt import task    @task()    def clean():        '''Clean build directory.'''        print 'Cleaning build directory...'    @task(clean)    def html(target='.'):        '''Generate HTML.'''        print 'Generating HTML in directory &quot;%s&quot;' %  target   @task()   def _copy_resources():       '''Copy resource files. This is a private task. &quot;pynt -l&quot; will not list this'''       print('Copying resource files')    @task(clean, _copy_resources)    def html(target='.'):        '''Generate HTML.'''        print 'Generating HTML in directory &quot;%s&quot;' %  target    @task(clean, _copy_resources, ignore=True)    def images():        '''Prepare images.'''        print 'Preparing images...'     @task(start_server) #Depends on task with all optional params     def stop_server():         print 'Stopping server....'    @task()    def copy_file(src, dest):        print 'Copying from %s to %s' % (src, dest)    @task()    def echo(*args,**kwargs):        print args        print kwargs    # Default task (if specified) is run when no task is specified in the command line    # make sure you define the variable __DEFAULT__ after the task is defined    # A good convention is to define it at the end of the module    # __DEFAULT__ is an optional member    __DEFAULT__=start_server**Running pynt tasks**----------------------The command line interface and help is automatically generated. Taskdescriptions are extracted from function docstrings.::    $ pynt -h    usage: pynt [-h] [-l] [-v] [-f file] [task [task ...]]    positional arguments:      task                  perform specified task and all its dependencies    optional arguments:      -h, --help            show this help message and exit      -l, --list-tasks      List the tasks      -v, --version         Display the version information      -f file, --file file  Build file to read the tasks from. Default is                            'build.py'::    $ pynt -l    Tasks in build file ./build.py:      clean                       Clean build directory.      copy_file                         echo                              html                        Generate HTML.      images           [Ignored]  Prepare images.      start_server     [Default]  Start the server      stop_server                     Powered by pynt - A Lightweight Python Build Tool.pynt takes care of dependencies between tasks. In the following casestart\_server depends on clean, html and image generation (image task isignored).::    $ pynt #Runs the default task start_server. It does exactly what &quot;pynt start_server&quot; would do.    [ example.py - Starting task &quot;clean&quot; ]    Cleaning build directory...    [ example.py - Completed task &quot;clean&quot; ]    [ example.py - Starting task &quot;html&quot; ]    Generating HTML in directory &quot;.&quot;    [ example.py - Completed task &quot;html&quot; ]    [ example.py - Ignoring task &quot;images&quot; ]    [ example.py - Starting task &quot;start_server&quot; ]    Starting server at localhost:80    [ example.py - Completed task &quot;start_server&quot; ]The first few characters of the task name is enough to execute the task,as long as the partial name is unambigious. You can specify multipletasks to run in the commandline. Again the dependencies are taken takencare of.::    $ pynt cle ht cl    [ example.py - Starting task &quot;clean&quot; ]    Cleaning build directory...    [ example.py - Completed task &quot;clean&quot; ]    [ example.py - Starting task &quot;html&quot; ]    Generating HTML in directory &quot;.&quot;    [ example.py - Completed task &quot;html&quot; ]    [ example.py - Starting task &quot;clean&quot; ]    Cleaning build directory...    [ example.py - Completed task &quot;clean&quot; ]The 'html' task dependency 'clean' is run only once. But clean can beexplicitly run again later.pynt tasks can accept parameters from commandline.::    $ pynt &quot;copy_file[/path/to/foo, path_to_bar]&quot;    [ example.py - Starting task &quot;clean&quot; ]    Cleaning build directory...    [ example.py - Completed task &quot;clean&quot; ]    [ example.py - Starting task &quot;copy_file&quot; ]    Copying from /path/to/foo to path_to_bar    [ example.py - Completed task &quot;copy_file&quot; ]pynt can also accept keyword arguments.::    $ pynt start[port=8888]    [ example.py - Starting task &quot;clean&quot; ]    Cleaning build directory...    [ example.py - Completed task &quot;clean&quot; ]    [ example.py - Starting task &quot;html&quot; ]    Generating HTML in directory &quot;.&quot;    [ example.py - Completed task &quot;html&quot; ]    [ example.py - Ignoring task &quot;images&quot; ]    [ example.py - Starting task &quot;start_server&quot; ]    Starting server at localhost:8888    [ example.py - Completed task &quot;start_server&quot; ]    $ pynt echo[hello,world,foo=bar,blah=123]    [ example.py - Starting task &quot;echo&quot; ]    ('hello', 'world')    {'blah': '123', 'foo': 'bar'}    [ example.py - Completed task &quot;echo&quot; ]**Organizing build scripts**----------------------------You can break up your build files into modules and simple import theminto your main build file.::    from deploy_tasks import *    from test_tasks import functional_tests, report_coverageContributors/Contributing--------------------------  Calum J. Eadie - pynt is preceded by and forked from   `microbuild &lt;https://github.com/CalumJEadie/microbuild&gt;`_, which was   created by `Calum J. Eadie &lt;https://github.com/CalumJEadie&gt;`_.If you want to make changes the repo is at https://github.com/rags/pynt.You will need `pytest &lt;http://www.pytest.org&gt;`_ to run the tests::    $ ./b tIt will be great if you can raise a `pullrequest &lt;https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests&gt;`_ onceyou are done.*If you find any bugs or need new features please raise a ticket in the`issues section &lt;https://github.com/rags/pynt/issues&gt;`_ of the githubrepo.*License-------pynt is licensed under a `MITlicense &lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT&gt;`_.. |BuildStatus| image:: https://travis-ci.org/rags/pynt.png?branch=masterChanges=======0.8.2 - 23/06/2018------------------* private tasks. Any tasks that start with an underscore(_) are private by convention.0.8.1 - 02/09/2013------------------* Enabling extensions0.8.0 - 02/09/2013------------------* Support for specifying a default task with __DEFAULT__ variable* pynt -v (--version) for displays version info* pynt -l lists tasks in alphabetical order0.7.1 - 17/03/2013------------------* Migrated pynt to work on python 3.x. pynt still works on 2.7.* pynt version now displayed as part of help output.0.7.0 - 16/02/2013------------------* New commandline interface. Distribution now includes 'pynt' executable.* 'build.py' is the default build file.* Build files no longer need &quot;if main&quot; construct.* pynt no longer exposes build method. This is a backward incompatible change.0.6.0 - 17/12/2012------------------* Simplified ignoring tasks. ignore a keyword param for task and not a separate decorator. [This change is NOT backward compatible!!!]* Added support for listing tasks* Improved help0.5.0 - 01/12/2012------------------* Ability to pass params to tasks.* Major rewrite and flattening the package hierarchy.0.4.0 - 17/11/2012------------------* Support for running multiple tasks from commandline.* Ability to run tasks by typing in just the first few unambigious charecters.Changes before forking from microbuild======================================0.3.0 - 18/09/2012------------------* Fixed bug in logging. No longer modifies root logger.* Added ignore functionality.* Extended API documentation.0.2.0 - 29/08/2012------------------* Added progress tracking output.* Added handling of exceptions within tasks.0.1.0 - 28/08/2012------------------* Initial release.* Added management of dependancies between tasks.* Added automatic generation of command line interface.</longdescription>
