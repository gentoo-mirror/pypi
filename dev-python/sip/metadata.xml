	<longdescription>SIP - A Python Bindings Generator for C and C++ Libraries=========================================================What is SIP?------------One of the features of Python that makes it so powerful is the ability to takeexisting libraries, written in C or C++, and make them available as Pythonextension modules.  Such extension modules are often called bindings for thelibrary.SIP is a collection of tools that makes it very easy to create Python bindingsfor C and C++ libraries.  It was originally developed in 1998 to create PyQt,the Python bindings for the Qt toolkit, but can be used to create bindings forany C or C++ library.  For example it is also used to generate wxPython, thePython bindings for wxWidgets.SIP comprises a set of build tools and a sip module. The build tools process aset of specification files and generates C or C++ code which is then compiledto create the bindings extension module.  Several extension modules may beinstalled in the same Python package.  Extension modules can be built so thatthey are are independent of the version of Python being used.  In other words awheel created from them can be installed with any version of Python startingwith v3.5.The specification files contain a description of the interface of the C or C++library, i.e. the classes, methods, functions and variables.  The format of aspecification file is almost identical to a C or C++ header file, so much sothat the easiest way of creating a specification file is to edit a copy of thecorresponding header file.The sip module provides support functions to the automatically generatedcode.  The sip module is installed as part of the same Python package as thegenerated extension modules.  Unlike the extension modules the sip module isspecific to a particular version of Python (e.g. v3.5, v3.6, v3.7, v3.8).SIP makes it easy to exploit existing C or C++ libraries in a productiveinterpretive programming environment.  SIP also makes it easy to take a Pythonapplication (maybe a prototype) and selectively implement parts of theapplication (maybe for performance reasons) in C or C++.Author------SIP is copyright (c) Riverbank Computing Limited.
