Download &amp; installation--------------------------Mpmath requires Python 2.7 or 3.5 (or later versions). It has been testedwith CPython 2.7, 3.5 through 3.7 and for PyPy.The latest release of mpmath can be downloaded from the mpmathwebsite and from https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/mpmath/releasesIt should also be available in the Python Package Index athttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/mpmathTo install latest release of Mpmath with pip, simply run``pip install mpmath``Or unpack the mpmath archive and run``python setup.py install``Mpmath can also be installed using``python -m easy_install mpmath``The latest development code is available fromhttps://github.com/fredrik-johansson/mpmathSee the main documentation for more detailed instructions.2. Running tests----------------The unit tests in mpmath/tests/ can be run via the scriptruntests.py, but it is recommended to run them with py.test(https://pytest.org/), especiallyto generate more useful reports in case there are failures.You may also want to check out the demo scripts in the demodirectory.The master branch is automatically tested by Travis CI.3. Documentation----------------Documentation in reStructuredText format is available in thedoc directory included with the source package. These filesare human-readable, but can be compiled to prettier HTML usingthe build.py script (requires Sphinx, http://sphinx.pocoo.org/).See setup.txt in the documentation for more information.The most recent documentation is also available in HTML format:http://mpmath.org/doc/current/4. Known problems-----------------Mpmath is a work in progress. Major issues include:* Some functions may return incorrect values when given extremely  large arguments or arguments very close to singularities.* Directed rounding works for arithmetic operations. It is implemented  heuristically for other operations, and their results may be off by one  or two units in the last place (even if otherwise accurate).* Some IEEE 754 features are not available. Inifinities and NaN are  partially supported; denormal rounding is currently not available  at all.* The interface for switching precision and rounding is not finalized.  The current method is not threadsafe.5. Help and bug reports-----------------------General questions and comments can be sent to the mpmath mailinglist,mpmath@googlegroups.comYou can also report bugs and send patches to the mpmath issue tracker,https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/mpmath/issues</longdescription>
