	<longdescription>``dantro``: handle, transform, and visualize hierarchically structured data===========================================================================``dantro`` – from *data* and *dentro* (Greek for *tree*) – is a Pythonpackage that provides a uniform interface for hierarchically structuredand semantically heterogeneous data. It is built around three mainfeatures:-  **data handling:** loading heterogeneous data into a tree-like data   structure, providing a uniform interface to it-  **data transformation:** performing arbitrary operations on the data,   if necessary using lazy evaluation-  **data visualization:** creating a visual representation of the   processed dataTogether, these stages constitute a **data processing pipeline**: anautomated sequence of predefined, configurable operations. Akin to aContinuous Integration pipeline, a data processing pipeline provides auniform, consistent, and easily extensible infrastructure thatcontributes to more efficient and reproducible workflows. This can bebeneficial especially in a scientific context, for instance whenhandling data that was generated by computer simulations.``dantro`` is meant to be *integrated* into projects and be used to set upsuch a data processing pipeline, customized to the needs of the project.It is designed to be **easily customizable** to the requirements of the projectit is integrated in, even if the involved data is hierachically structured orsemantically heterogeneous.Furthermore, it allows a **configuration-based specification** of alloperations via `YAML &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML&gt;`_ configurationfiles; the resulting pipeline can then be controlled entirely via theseconfiguration files and without requiring code changes.The ``dantro`` package is **open source software** released under the`LGPLv3+ &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html&gt;`_ license.It was developed alongside the `Utopia project &lt;https://gitlab.com/utopia-project/utopia&gt;`_(a modelling framework for complex and adaptive systems), but is anindependent package.Learn more----------* `Documentation &lt;https://dantro.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_* `Project page &lt;https://gitlab.com/utopia-project/dantro&gt;`_* `README and installation instructions &lt;https://gitlab.com/utopia-project/dantro#installing-dantro&gt;`_* `Publication in the Journal of Open Source Software &lt;https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02316&gt;`_* `Utopia Project Website &lt;https://utopia-project.org/&gt;`_</longdescription>
