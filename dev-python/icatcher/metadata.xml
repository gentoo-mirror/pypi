	<longdescription>[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/486841882.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/486841882)# iCatcher+# IntroductionThis repository contains all the code for [iCatcher+](https://psyarxiv.com/up97k/), a tool for performing automatic annotation of discrete infant gaze directions from videos collected in the lab, field or online (remotely). It also contains code for reproducing the original manuscripts results.Click below for a video including examples of representative good and poor performance, taken from videos of infants participating in online research (all families featured consented to sharing their video data publicly):[![iCatcher representative good and poor performance](https://img.youtube.com/vi/iK_T2P2ZDnU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK_T2P2ZDnU)# Installation## Quick installation (Windows, Linux, Mac)This option will let you use iCatcher+ with minimum effort, but only for predictions (inference).We strongly recommend using a virtual environment such as [Miniconda](https://conda.io) or [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) before running the command below.`pip install icatcher`You will also need [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) installed in your system and available. When using for the first time, neural network model files will automatically be downloaded to a local cache folder. To control where they are downloaded to set the &quot;ICATCHER_DATA_DIR&quot; environment variable.## Installation for reproduction of original research resultsThis options allows you to reproduce the paper results, train icatcher on your own dataset, compare and measure performance and visualize results as well.### Step 1: Clone this repository to get a copy of the code to run locally`git clone https://github.com/yoterel/icatcher_plus.git`### Step 2: Create a conda virtual environmentWe recommend installing [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for this, then create an environment using the environment.yml file in this repository:**Note**: conda must be in the PATH envrionment variable for the shell to find it.Navigate to the icatcher_plus reproduce folder using the Anaconda Prompt:`cd /path/to/icathcer_plus/reproduce`Then:`conda env create -n env -f environment.yml`Or (if you want to install the environment in a specific location):`conda env create --prefix /path/to/virtual/environment -f &quot;/path/to/environment.yml&quot;`**Note for Mac users**: you might need to edit the [environment.yml](https://github.com/yoterel/icatcher_plus/blob/master/environment.yml) file depending on your OS version. see [here](https://github.com/yoterel/icatcher_plus/issues/6#issuecomment-1244125700) for how.Activate the environment`conda activate env`### Step 3: Download the neural network model &amp; weight filesiCatcher+ relies on some neural-network model files to work (or reproduce experiments).Please download all files from [here](https://osf.io/ycju8/download) and place them in the reproduce/models directory.# Running iCatcher+If you installed iCatcher+ from source, the inference file is &quot;test.py&quot;. It will require an additional mandatory argument of which model file to use for predicitons.Otherwise, using the quick installation, you can run iCatcher+ with the command:`icatcher --help`which will list all available options. Description below will help you get more familiar with some common command line arguments.To run iCatcher+ with a video file (if a folder is provided, all videos will be used for prediction):`icatcher /path/to/my/video.mp4`A common option is to add:`icatcher /path/to/my/video.mp4 --use_fc_model`Which enables a child face detector for more robust results (however, sometimes this can result in too much loss of data).You can save a labeled video by adding:`--output_video_path /path/to/output_folder`If you want to output annotations to a file, use:`--output_annotation /path/to/output_annotation_folder`To show the predictions online in a seperate window, add the option:`--show_output`You can also add parameters to crop the video a given percent before passing to iCatcher: `--crop_mode m` where `m` is any of [top, left, right], specifying which side of the video to crop from (if not provided, default is none; if crop_percent is provided but not crop_mode, default is top)`--crop_percent x` where `x` is an integer (default = 0) specifying what percent of the video size to crop from the specified side. E.g., if `--crop_mode top` is provided with `--crop_percent 10`, 10% of the video height will be cropped from the top. If `--crop_mode left` is provided with `--crop_percent 25`, 25% of the video width will be cropped from the left side, etc. # Output formatCurrently we supports 2 output formats, though further formats can be added upon request.- raw_output: a file where each row will contain the frame number, the class prediction and the confidence of that prediction seperated by a comma- compressed: a npz file containing two numpy arrays, one encoding the predicted class (n x 1 int32) and another the confidence (n x 1 float32) where n is the number of frames. This file can be loaded into memory using the numpy.load function. For the map between class number and name see test.py (&quot;predict_from_video&quot; function).# Datasets access &amp; reproduction of resultsThe public videos from the Lookit dataset, along with human annotations and group-level demographics for all datasets, are available at https://osf.io/ujteb/. Videos from the Lookit dataset with permission granted for scientific use are available at https://osf.io/5u9df/. Requests for access can be directed to Junyi Chu (junyichu@mit.edu).Requests for access to the remainder of the datasets (Cali-BW, Senegal) can be directed to Dr. Katherine Adams Shannon (katashannon@gmail.com). Note that access to raw video files from the California-BW and Senegal datasets *is not available* due to restricted participant privacy agreements. To protect participant privacy, the participant identifiers for the video and demographic data are not linked to each other. However, this information is available upon reasonable request.We made substantial effort to allow reproduction of results form the paper. True reproduction requires full access to the datasets (including the videos).Instead, to reproduce most of the statistics we present in the paper for the Lookit dataset, run visualize.py using the following commands:First navigate to the reproduce folder:`cd /path/to/icatcher_plus/reproduce`Then run:`python visualize.py output resource/lookit_annotations/coding_human1 resource/lookit_annotations/coding_icatcherplus just_annotations --human2_codings_folder resource/lookit_annotations/coding_human2`Results will appear in a folder called &quot;output&quot;.## Best Results (test sets)To view visualizations of all results, see [plots](https://github.com/yoterel/icatcher_plus/tree/master/reproduce/plots).Per-session plots (i.e. per-video) are sorted from 0 to n, where 0 has the lowest agreement (between iCatcher+ and Coder 1) and n the highest.### A Note About Data-LeaksThe test sets were kept &quot;untouched&quot; until the very last stages of submission (i.e. they were not *directly* nor *indirectly* used optimize the network models). Conforming to this methodolgy is encouraged to avoid data leaks, so if you happen to submit improvements made to iCatcher+ in terms of performance, **do not** use the test sets for improving your method. Please consider creating a validation set out of the original training set for that.&lt;table&gt;        &lt;tr&gt;                &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/yoterel/icatcher_plus/blob/master/resource/agreement.png&quot;  alt=&quot;0&quot; width = 400px height = 300px &gt;&lt;/td&gt;                &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/yoterel/icatcher_plus/blob/master/resource/agreement_vs_confidence.png&quot;  alt=&quot;0&quot; width = 400px height = 300px &gt;&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;/tr&gt;        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=2&gt;Lookit&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;        &lt;tr&gt;                &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/yoterel/icatcher_plus/blob/master/resource/lookit_bar.png&quot; alt=&quot;0&quot; width = 400px height = 300px&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/yoterel/icatcher_plus/blob/master/resource/lookit_conf.png&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; width = 300px height = 300px&gt;&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;/tr&gt;        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=2&gt;California-BW&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;        &lt;tr&gt;                &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/yoterel/icatcher_plus/blob/master/resource/cali-bw_bar.png&quot; alt=&quot;0&quot; width = 400px height = 300px&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/yoterel/icatcher_plus/blob/master/resource/cali-bw_conf.png&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; width = 300px height = 300px&gt;&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;/tr&gt;        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=2&gt;Senegal&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;        &lt;tr&gt;                &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/yoterel/icatcher_plus/blob/master/resource/senegal_bar.png&quot; alt=&quot;0&quot; width = 400px height = 300px&gt;&lt;/td&gt;                &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/yoterel/icatcher_plus/blob/master/resource/senegal_conf.png&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; width = 300px height = 300px&gt;&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;# Performance BenchmarkWe benchmarked iCatcher+ performance over 10 videos (res 640 x 480).
