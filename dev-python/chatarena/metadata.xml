It drives the main loop of the game and   provides HCI utilities like webUI, CLI, configuration loading and data storage.2. **Environment**: The environment stores the game state and executes game logics to make transitions between game   states. It also renders observations for players, the observations are natural languages.    1. The game state is not directly visible to the players. Players can only see the observations.3. **Language Backend**: Language backends are the source of language intelligence. It takes text (or collection of   text) as input and returns text in response.4. **Player**: The player is an agent that plays the game. In RL terminology, it‚Äôs a policy, a stateless function   mapping from observations to actions.### Run the Game with Python APILoad `Arena` from a config file -- here we use `examples/nlp-classroom-3players.json` in this repository as an example:```pythonarena = Arena.from_config(&quot;examples/nlp-classroom-3players.json&quot;)arena.run(num_steps=10)```Run the game in an interactive CLI interface:```pythonarena.launch_cli()```Check out this video to learn how to useCLI: [![cli demo video](https://img.shields.io/badge/CLI%20Demo%20Video-Vimeo-blue?logo=vimeo)](https://vimeo.com/816989884)A more detailed guide about how to run the main interaction loop with finer-grained control can befound [here](docs/devdoc/mainloop.md)### General Customization Advice1. **Arena**: Overriding Arena basically means one is going to write their own main loop. This can allow different   interaction interfaces or drive games in a more automated manner, for example, running an online RL training loop2. **Environment**: A new environment corresponds to a new game, one can define the game dynamics here with hard-coded   rules or a mixture of rules and language backend.3. **Backend**: If one needs to change the way of formatting observations (in terms of messages) into queries for the   language model, the backend should be overridden.4. **Player**: By default, when a new observation is fed, players will query the language backend and return the   response as actions. But one can also customize the way that players are interacting with the language backend.### Creating your Custom EnvironmentYou can define your own environment by extending the `Environment` class. Here are the general steps:1. Define the class by inheriting from a base class and setting `type_name`, then add the class   to [`ALL_ENVIRONMENTS`](chatarena/environments/__init__.py#L17)2. Initialize the class by defining `__init__` method (its arguments will define the corresponding config) and   initializing class attributes3. Implement game mechanics in methods `step`4. Handle game states and rewards by implementing methods such as `reset`, `get_observation`, `is_terminal`,   and `get_rewards`5. Develop role description prompts (and a global prompt if necessary) for players using CLI or Web UI and save them to   a   config file.We provide [a detailed tutorial](docs/tutorials/create_your_environment.md) to demonstrate how to define a customenvironment,using the [`Chameleon` environment](chatarena/environments/chameleon.py) as example.If you want to port an existing library's environment to ChatArena, checkout [`PettingzooChess` environment](chatarena/environments/pettingzoo_chess.py) as an example.## List of Environments### [Conversation](chatarena/environments/conversation.py)A multi-player language game environment that simulates aconversation.* [NLP Classroom](examples/nlp-classroom-3players.json): a 3-player language game environment that simulates a  classroom  setting. The game is played in turns, and each turn a player can either ask a question or answer a question.  The game ends when all players have asked and answered all questions.### [Moderator Conversation](chatarena/environments/conversation.py)Based on conversation, but with a moderator that controls the game dynamics.* [Rock-paper-scissors](examples/rock-paper-scissors.json): a 2-player language game environment that simulates a  rock-paper-scissors game with moderator conversation.  Both player will act in parallel, and the game ends when one player wins 2 rounds.* [Tic-tac-toe](examples/tic-tac-toe.json): a 2-player language game environment that simulates a tic-tac-toe  game with moderator conversation.  The game is played in turns, and each turn a player can either ask for a move or make a move. The game ends when  one  player wins or the board is full.### [Chameleon](chatarena/environments/chameleon.py)A multi-player social deduction game. There are two roles in the game, chameleon and non-chameleon.The topic of the secret word will be first revealed to all the players.Then the secret word will be revealed to non-chameleons.The chameleon does not know the secret word.The objective in the game depends on the role of the player:- If you are not a chameleon, your goal is to reveal the chameleon without exposing the secret word.- If you are a chameleon, your aim is to blend in with other players, avoid being caught, and figure out the secret  word.  There are three stages in the game:1. The giving clues stage: each player will describe the clues about the secret word.2. The accusation stage: In this stage, each player will vote for another player who is most likely the chameleon. The   chameleon should vote for other players.3. The guess stage: If the accusation is correct, the chameleon should guess the secret word given the clues revealed by   other players.### [PettingZooChess](chatarena/environments/pettingzoo_chess.py)A two-player chess game environment that uses the PettingZoo Chess environment.### [PettingZooTicTacTeo](chatarena/environments/pettingzoo_tictactoe.py)A two-player tic-tac-toe game environment that uses the PettingZoo TicTacToe environment. Differing from the`Moderator Conversation` environment, this environment is driven by hard-coded rules rather than a LLM moderator.## ContributingWe welcome contributions to improve and extend ChatArena.
