	<longdescription>just_playback=========A small library for playing audio files in python. Provides file format independent methods for loading audio files, playing, pausing, resuming, stopping, seeking, getting the current playback position, and changing the volume.The package uses [miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio) for awesome cross-platform, dependency-free asynchronous audio playback that stays away from your main thread.Installation-------------pip install just_playbackUsage-------------``` pythonfrom just_playback import Playbackplayback = Playback() # creates an object for managing playback of a single audio fileplayback.load_file('music-files/sample.mp3')# or just pass the filename directly to the constructorplayback.play() # plays loaded audio file from the beginningplayback.pause() # pauses playback. Has no effect if playback is already pausedplayback.resume() # resumes playback. Has no effect if playback is playingplayback.stop() # stops playback. Has no effect if playback is not activeplayback.seek(60) # positions playback at 1 minute from the start of the audio fileplayback.set_volume(0.5) # sets the playback volume to 50% of the audio file's original valueplayback.loop_at_end(True) # since 0.1.5. Causes playback to automatically restart when it completes.playback.active # True if playback is active i.e playing or pausedplayback.playing # True if playback is active and not pausedplayback.curr_pos # current absolute playback position in seconds from   #the start of the audio file (unlike pygame.mixer.get_pos). playback.paused # True if playback is paused.playback.duration # length of the audio file in seconds. playback.volume # current playback volumeplayback.loops_at_end # True if playback is set to restart when it completes.```</longdescription>
