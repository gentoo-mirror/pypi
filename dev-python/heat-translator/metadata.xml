Change things from this point on===============Heat-Translator===============Overview--------Heat-Translator is an Openstack project and licensed under Apache 2. It is acommand line tool which takes non-Heat templates as an input and produces aHeat Orchestration Template (HOT) which can be deployed by Heat. Currently thedevelopment and testing is done with an aim to translate OASIS Topology andOrchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) templates toHOT. However, the tool is designed to be easily extended to use with anyformat other than TOSCA.Architecture------------Heat-Translator project takes a non-Heat template (e.g. TOSCA flat YAMLtemplate or template embedded in TOSCA Cloud Service Archive (CSAR) format) asan input, calls an appropriate Parser (e.g. TOSCA Parser) per the type of inputtemplate to parse it and create an in-memory graph, maps it to Heat resourcesand then produces a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT) as an output.How To Use----------Please refer to `doc/source/usage.rst &lt;https://github.com/openstack/heat-translator/blob/master/doc/source/usage.rst&gt;`_Directory Structure-------------------Three main directories related to the heat-translator are:1. hot: It is the generator, that has logic of converting TOSCA in memory graph to HOT YAML files.2. common: It has all the file that can support the execution of parser and generator.3. tests: It contains test programs and more importantly several templates which are used for testing.Project Info------------* License: Apache License, Version 2.0* Documentation: http://docs.openstack.org/heat-translator/* Bugs and Blueprints: https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/openstack/heat-translator* Source: http://opendev.org/openstack/heat-translator/* IRC Channel: #openstack-heat-translator</longdescription>
