You can use `conversant` on a [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) app without installing anything [here](https://conversant.streamlit.app/)! üéâ&lt;p float=&quot;none&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/cohere-ai/sandbox-conversant-lib/raw/main/static/fortune-teller-setup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing the available personas on the Streamlit demo, with the Fortune Teller persona selected by default..&quot; height=&quot;550&quot;/&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/cohere-ai/sandbox-conversant-lib/raw/main/static/fortune-teller-chat.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing an exchange between a Fortune Teller chatbot and a user.&quot; height=&quot;550&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;### Running Your Own Streamlit DemoCohere uses Streamlit to create its demo applications. If you‚Äôre new to Streamlit, you can install it [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation) and read more about running Streamlit commands [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/main-concepts).If you would like to modify this Streamlit demo locally, we strongly recommend forking this repository rather than installing it as a library from PyPI.If you'd like to spin up your own instance of the Streamlit demo, you will first need a `COHERE_API_KEY`. You can generate one by visiting [dashboard.cohere.ai](https://dashboard.cohere.ai/welcome/register?utm_source=github&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=sandbox&amp;utm_content=conversant). #### Local Streamlit appsIf you plan to run the Streamlit app locally, you can add the key to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:```COHERE_API_KEY = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&quot;```When running locally, Streamlit will read the `secrets.toml` file and silently inject these values into the environment variables. Alternatively, you may directly set the API key as an environment variable by running the following command from the command line:```export COHERE_API_KEY = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&quot;```Start the Streamlit app from the command line with the following command:```streamlit run conversant/demo/streamlit_example.py```#### Hosted Streamlit appsIf instead you would like to create a hosted Streamlit app, add your Cohere API key to Streamlit via [Secrets Management](https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-cloud/get-started/deploy-an-app/connect-to-data-sources/secrets-management). Add the following line as a Secret:```COHERE_API_KEY = &quot;YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&quot;```### Creating a Custom PersonaOnce you have your own instance of the Streamlit app, you can begin experimenting with creating custom personas! Check out the `config.json` for each persona in [`conversant/personas`](https://github.com/cohere-ai/sandbox-conversant-lib/tree/main/conversant/personas) directory. You'll need to create a subfolder within this directory that corresponds to your new persona and add a `config.json` file. As a note, we strongly recommend forking the `sandbox-conversant-lib` repository rather than installing it as a library from PyPI. When you create a new persona, use the `personas` directory in the cloned repository. The directory structure should look like this:```conversant/personas‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fortune-teller‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your-persona-name # new    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json```The config file should contain the following:- `chatbot_config`:   -  `max_context_examples`: The length of the chat history for the chatbot to use in reply.  -  `avatar`: Optional emoji shortcode or URL to image as the chatbot's avatar. Defaults to ü§ñ.-  `client_config`: Parameters for [`co.generate()`](https://docs.cohere.ai/generate-reference)-  `chat_prompt_config`:    - `preamble`: Description of the persona.   - `example_separator`: A string that separates each example conversation.   - `headers`: A name for the `bot` and the `user`.   - `examples`: A few conversation examples (few-shot), or empty (zero-shot).`conversant` will take care of the rest! As an example, check out [`fortune-teller/config.json`](https://github.com/cohere-ai/sandbox-conversant-lib/blob/main/conversant/personas/fortune-teller/config.json). When you launch the Streamlit app, the new persona will appear in the drop down menu.#### Running the app with a subset of custom personasIf you would like to run the app with a subset of custom personas, it's possible to create a new directory that contains only the desired ones. This is analogous to the `conversant/personas` directory, and needs to have the same structure:```custom-personas‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your-first-persona‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your-second-persona    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json```  After creating this directory, you'll need to tell the app where to look for it. In the demo Streamlit app (`streamlit_example.py`), one of the first lines reads `CUSTOM_PERSONA_DIRECTORY = None`. Change this to specify the desired persona directory, e.g. `CUSTOM_PERSONA_DIRECTORY = &quot;/Users/yourname/custom-personas&quot;`.If this is unchanged, the app will default to using the directory that contains the `conversant` demo personas.#### Troubleshooting missing personasIf you do not see the new persona in the drop down menu, you may need to specify a custom persona directory. Follow [the instructions above](#running-the-app-with-a-subset-of-custom-personas) to tell the app where to look for the personas.### Editing a Persona on the DemoYou can also edit a persona on the Streamlit app!&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/cohere-ai/sandbox-conversant-lib/raw/main/static/fortune-teller-edit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot showing the interface for editing a persona on the Streamlit app.&quot;/&gt;### UsageWith `conversant`, you can create a chatbot powered by [Cohere](https://cohere.ai/)'s large language models with just the following code snippet.```pythonimport cohereimport conversantco = cohere.Client(&quot;YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&quot;)bot = conversant.PromptChatbot.from_persona(&quot;fantasy-wizard&quot;, client=co)print(bot.reply(&quot;Hello!&quot;))&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Well met, fair traveller. What bringest thou to mine village?&quot;```You can also define your own persona by passing in your own `ChatPrompt`. ```pythonfrom conversant.prompts import ChatPromptshakespeare_config = {    &quot;preamble&quot;: &quot;Below is a conversation between Shakespeare and a Literature Student.&quot;,    &quot;example_separator&quot;: &quot;&lt;CONVERSATION&gt;\n&quot;,    &quot;headers&quot;: {        &quot;user&quot;: &quot;Literature Student&quot;,        &quot;bot&quot;: &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;,    },    &quot;examples&quot;: [        [            {                &quot;user&quot;: &quot;Who are you?&quot;,                &quot;bot&quot;: &quot;Mine own nameth is Shakespeare, and I speaketh in riddles.&quot;,            },        ]    ],}shakespeare_bot = conversant.PromptChatbot(    client=co, prompt=ChatPrompt.from_dict(shakespeare_config))print(shakespeare_bot.reply(&quot;Hello!&quot;))&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Greeteth, and welcome. I am Shakespeare, the great poet, dramatist, and playwright.&quot;```&lt;!-- From here, it's also possible to talk to your chatbot using the [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) app! This will launch the demo with your chatbot persona pre-selected. For this to work, `COHERE_API_KEY` needs to be set as an environment variable.```pythonfrom conversant.utils import demo_utilsdemo_utils.launch_streamlit(shakespeare_bot)``` --&gt;## How Conversant Works`conversant` uses prompt completion to define a chatbot persona with a description and a few examples. The prompt is sent as input to Cohere's [`co.generate()`](https://docs.cohere.ai/generate-reference/) endpoint for an autoregressive language model to generate text in a few-shot manner from the examples and the current dialogue context. Each user message and chatbot response is appended to a chat history so that future responses are conditioned on the dialogue context at that point in time.In the future, we plan to add functionality for a chatbot to be factually grounded using text that is retrieved from a local document cache.For more information, refer to [this section in `CONTRIBUTORS.md`](https://github.com/cohere-ai/sandbox-conversant-lib/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md#conversant-schematic).## DocumentationFull documentation can be found [here](https://cohere-ai.github.io/sandbox-conversant-lib/).## Get SupportIf you have any questions or comments, please file an issue or reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/co-mmunity).## Contributing GuidelinesIf you would like to contribute to this project, please read [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](https://github.com/cohere-ai/sandbox-conversant-lib/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md)in this repository, and sign the Contributor License Agreement before submittingany pull requests.
