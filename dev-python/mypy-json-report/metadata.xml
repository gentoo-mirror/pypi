	<longdescription># Mypy JSON ReportA JSON report of your mypy outputthat helps you push towards full type coverage of your project.## QuickstartInstall with pip.```pip install mypy-json-report```Pipe the output of mypy through the `mypy-json-report` CLI app.Store the output to a file, and commit it to your git repo.```mypy . --strict | mypy-json-report parse --output-file mypy-ratchet.jsongit add mypy-ratchet.jsongit commit -m &quot;Add mypy errors ratchet file&quot;```Now you have a snapshot of the mypy errors in your project.Compare against this file when making changes to your project to catch regressions and improvements.## Example outputIf mypy was showing you errors like this:```example.py:8: error: Function is missing a return type annotationexample.py:8: note: Use &quot;-&gt; None&quot; if function does not return a valueexample.py:58: error: Call to untyped function &quot;main&quot; in typed contextexample.py:69: error: Call to untyped function &quot;main&quot; in typed contextFound 3 errors in 1 file (checked 3 source files)```Then the report would look like this:```json{  &quot;example.py&quot;: {    &quot;Call to untyped function \&quot;main\&quot; in typed context&quot;: 2,    &quot;Function is missing a return type annotation&quot;: 1  }}```Errors are grouped by file.To reduce churn,the line on which the errors occur is removedand repeated errors are counted.## Ratchet fileThe `--diff-old-report FILENAME` flag serves two purposes.1. It prints new (and adjacent, and similar) errors to STDERR.   This is useful for seeing what errors need to be fixed before committing.1. It will error when the ratchet file doesn't match the new report.   This is helpful for catching uncommitted changes in CI.## Example usageYou could create a GitHub Action to catch regressions (or improvements).```yaml---name: Mypy checkon: [push]jobs:  build:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  mypy:    steps:      - name: Checkout code        uses: actions/checkout@v2      - name: Set up Python        uses: actions/setup-python@v2        with:          python-version: &quot;3.10&quot;      - name: Install Python dependencies        run: |          pip install mypy mypy-json-report      - name: Run mypy        run: |          mypy . --strict | mypy-json-report parse --diff-old-report mypy-ratchet.json --output-file mypy-ratchet.json```</longdescription>
