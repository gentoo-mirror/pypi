Pygame comes with many tutorials andintroductions.  There is also full reference documentation for theentire library. Browse the documentation on the `docs page`_. Youcan also browse the documentation locally by running``python -m pygame.docs`` in your terminal. If the docs aren't foundlocally, it'll launch the online website instead.The online documentation stays up to date with the development versionof pygame on github.  This may be a bit newer than the version of pygameyou are using. To upgrade to the latest full release, run ``pip install pygame-ce --upgrade`` in your terminal.Best of all, the examples directory has many playable small programswhich can get you started playing with the code right away.Building From Source--------------------If you want to use features that are currently in development,or you want to contribute to pygame, you will need to build pygamelocally from its source code, rather than pip installing it.Installing from source is fairly automated. The most work willinvolve compiling and installing all the pygame dependencies.  Oncethat is done, run the ``setup.py`` script which will attempt toauto-configure, build, and install pygame.Much more information about installing and compiling is availableon the `Compilation wiki page`_.Credits-------Thanks to everyone who has helped contribute to this library.Special thanks are also in order.* Marcus Von Appen: many changes, and fixes, 1.7.1+ freebsd maintainer* Lenard Lindstrom: the 1.8+ windows maintainer, many changes, and fixes* Brian Fisher for svn auto builder, bug tracker and many contributions* Rene Dudfield: many changes, and fixes, 1.7+ release manager/maintainer* Phil Hassey for his work on the pygame.org website* DR0ID for his work on the sprite module* Richard Goedeken for his smoothscale function* Ulf Ekström for his pixel perfect collision detection code* Pete Shinners: original author* David Clark for filling the right-hand-man position* Ed Boraas and Francis Irving: Debian packages* Maxim Sobolev: FreeBSD packaging* Bob Ippolito: MacOS and OS X porting (much work!)* Jan Ekhol, Ray Kelm, and Peter Nicolai: putting up with early design ideas* Nat Pryce for starting our unit tests* Dan Richter for documentation work* TheCorruptor for his incredible logos and graphics* Nicholas Dudfield: many test improvements* Alex Folkner for pygame-ctypesThanks to those sending in patches and fixes: Niki Spahiev, GordonTyler, Nathaniel Pryce, Dave Wallace, John Popplewell, Michael Urman,Andrew Straw, Michael Hudson, Ole Martin Bjoerndalen, Herve Cauwelier,James Mazer, Lalo Martins, Timothy Stranex, Chad Lester, MatthiasSpiller, Bo Jangeborg, Dmitry Borisov, Campbell Barton, Diego Essaya,Eyal Lotem, Regis Desgroppes, Emmanuel Hainry, Randy KaelberMatthew L Daniel, Nirav Patel, Forrest Voight, Charlie Nolan,Frankie Robertson, John Krukoff, Lorenz Quack, Nick Irvine,Michael George, Saul Spatz, Thomas Ibbotson, Tom Rothamel, Evan Kroske,Cambell Barton.And our bug hunters above and beyond: Angus, Guillaume Proux, FrankRaiser, Austin Henry, Kaweh Kazemi, Arturo Aldama, Mike Mulcheck,Michael Benfield, David LauThere's many more folks out there who've submitted helpful ideas, keptthis project going, and basically made our life easier.  Thanks!Many thank you's for people making documentation comments, and adding to thepygame.org wiki.Also many thanks for people creating games and putting them on thepygame.org website for others to learn from and enjoy.Lots of thanks to James Paige for hosting the pygame bugzilla.Also a big thanks to Roger Dingledine and the crew at SEUL.ORG for ourexcellent hosting.Dependencies------------Pygame is obviously strongly dependent on SDL and Python.  It alsolinks to and embeds several other smaller libraries.  The fontmodule relies on SDL_ttf, which is dependent on freetype.  The mixer(and mixer.music) modules depend on SDL_mixer.  The image moduledepends on SDL_image, which also can use libjpeg and libpng.  Thetransform module has an embedded version of SDL_rotozoom for itsown rotozoom function.  The surfarray module requires the PythonNumPy package for its multidimensional numeric arrays.Dependency versions:+----------+------------------------+| CPython  | &gt;= 3.7 (Or use PyPy3)  |+----------+------------------------+| SDL      | &gt;= 2.0.8               |+----------+------------------------+| SDL_mixer| &gt;= 2.0.0               |+----------+------------------------+| SDL_image| &gt;= 2.0.2               |+----------+------------------------+| SDL_ttf  | &gt;= 2.0.12              |+----------+------------------------+| SDL_gfx  | (Optional, vendored in)|+----------+------------------------+| NumPy    | &gt;= 1.6.2 (Optional)    |+----------+------------------------+License-------This library is distributed under `GNU LGPL version 2.1`_, which canbe found in the file ``docs/LGPL.txt``.  We reserve the right to placefuture versions of this library under a different license.This basically means you can use pygame in any project you want,but if you make any changes or additions to pygame itself, thosemust be released with a compatible license (preferably submittedback to the pygame project).  Closed source and commercial games are fine.The programs in the ``examples`` subdirectory are in the public domain.See docs/licenses for licenses of dependencies... |PyPiVersion| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pygame-ce.svg?v=1   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygame-ce.. |PyPiLicense| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/pygame-ce.svg?v=1   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygame-ce.. |Python3| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3-blue.svg?v=1.. |GithubCommits| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/pygame-community/pygame-ce/2.3.0.svg   :target: https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce/compare/2.3.0...main.. |DocsStatus| image:: https://img.shields.io/website?down_message=offline&amp;label=docs&amp;up_message=online&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpyga.me%2Fdocs%2F   :target: https://pyga.me/docs/   .. |BlackFormatBadge| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg    :target: https://github.com/psf/black.. _pygame: https://pyga.me.. _Simple DirectMedia Layer library: https://www.libsdl.org.. _We need your help: https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html.. _Compilation wiki page: https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce/wiki#compiling.. _docs page: https://pyga.me/docs.. _GNU LGPL version 2.1: https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html.. _简体中文: ./docs/readmes/README.zh-cn.rst.. _Français: ./docs/readmes/README.fr.rst.. _فارسی: ./docs/readmes/README.fa.rst</longdescription>
