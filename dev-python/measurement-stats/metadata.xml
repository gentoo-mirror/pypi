	<longdescription>Measurement Statistics======================A statistical package for measurement and population statistics thatincorporate measurement uncertainties and error propagation.Installation::    pip install measurement_statsError Propagation-----------------Say, for example, that we have measured a rectangle to be 11 +/- 0.4 centimeterswide and 8 +/- 0.3 centimeters long. We can then calculate the area withuncertainty as follows::    from measurement_stats import ValueUncertainty    width = ValueUncertainty(11, 0.4)    length = ValueUncertainty(8, 0.3)    area = length * width    print('AREA:', area.label)    # $ AREA: 88 +/- 5For a more complicated example, consider the canonical physics 101 experimentof trying to calculate the acceleration due to gravity using a pendulum. If astudent has setup a pendulum with a measured length of 92.95 centimeters and anuncertainty of 0.1 centimeters and measured a period of that pendulum to be1.936 seconds with an uncertainty of 0.004 seconds, the acceleration due togravity, with propagated uncertainty, can be determined as follows::    from measurement_stats import ValueUncertainty    l = ValueUncertainty(92.95, 0.1)    T = ValueUncertainty(1.936, 0.004)    g = 4.0 * (math.pi ** 2) * l / (T ** 2)    print('Acceleration Due To Gravity:', g.label)    # $ Acceleration Due To Gravity: 979 +/- 4</longdescription>
