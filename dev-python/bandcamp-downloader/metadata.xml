About 20% of the reports wereceive are already fixed, but people are using outdated versions. Thisgoes for feature requests as well.Is the issue already documented?--------------------------------Make sure that someone has not already opened the issue you're trying toopen. Search at the top of the window or at`Issues &lt;https://github.com/iheanyi/bandcamp-dl/search?type=Issues&gt;`_.If there is an issue, feel free to write something along the lines of&quot;This affects me as well, with version 2015.01.01. Here is some moreinformation on the issue: ...&quot;. While some issues may be old, a new postinto them often spurs rapid activity.Why are existing options not enough?------------------------------------Before requesting a new feature, please have a quick peek at `the listof supportedoptions &lt;https://github.com/iheanyi/bandcamp-dl/blob/master/README.rst#synopsis&gt;`_.Many feature requests are for features that actually exist already!Please, absolutely do show off your work in the issue report and detailhow the existing similar options do *not* solve your problem.Does the issue involve one problem, and one problem only?---------------------------------------------------------Some of our users seem to think there is a limit of issues they can orshould open. There is no limit of issues they can or should open. Whileit may seem appealing to be able to dump all your issues into oneticket, that means that someone who solves one of your issues cannotmark the issue as closed. Typically, reporting a bunch of issues leadsto the ticket lingering since nobody wants to attack that behemoth,until someone mercifully splits the issue into multiple ones.Is anyone going to need the feature?------------------------------------Only post features that you (or an incapable friend you canpersonally talk to) require. Do not post features because they seem likea good idea. If they are really useful, they will be requested bysomeone who requires them.Is your question about bandcamp-dl?-----------------------------------It may sound strange, but some bug reports we receive are completelyunrelated to bandcamp-dl and relate to a different or even thereporter's own application.
