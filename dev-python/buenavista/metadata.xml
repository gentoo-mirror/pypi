	<longdescription># Buena Vista: A Programmable Postgres Proxy ServerBuena Vista is a Python library that provides a [socketserver](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socketserver.html)-based implementationof the [Postgres wire protocol (PDF)](https://beta.pgcon.org/2014/schedule/attachments/330_postgres-for-the-wire.pdf).I started working on this project in order to address a common issue that people had when they were using anotherone of my Python projects, [dbt-duckdb](https://github.com/jwills/dbt-duckdb): when a long-running Python processis operating on a [DuckDB](http://duckdb.org) database, you cannot connect to the DuckDB file using the CLI orwith a database query tool like [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) to examine the state of the database, because each DuckDB filemay only be open by a single process at a time. The Buena Vista library makes it possible to work with a DuckDB databasefrom multiple different processes over the Postgres wire protocol, and the library makes it simple enough to run an examplethat illustrates the idea locally:```shpip3 install buenavistapython3 -m buenavista.examples.duckdb_postgres &lt;optional_duckdb_file&gt;```in order to start a Postgres server on `localhost:5433` backed by the DuckDB database file that you passed in at the command line(or by an in-memory DuckDB database if you do not specify an argument.) You should be able to query the database via `psql` inanother window by running `psql -h localhost -p 5433` (no database/username/password arguments required) or by using the DBeaverPostgres client connection.</longdescription>
