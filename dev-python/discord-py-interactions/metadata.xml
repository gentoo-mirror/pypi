No problem! With builtin extensions, you are able to extend the functionality of the library. And if none of those pique your interest, there are a myriad of other extension libraries available.Just type `bot.load(&quot;extension&quot;)`&lt;details&gt;    &lt;summary&gt;Extensions&lt;/summary&gt;   ### Prefixed Commands   Prefixed commands, message commands, or legacy commands.
