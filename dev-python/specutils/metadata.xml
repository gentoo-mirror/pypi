The effort isalso meant to be a &quot;hub&quot;, helping to unite the Python astronomical spectroscopycommunity around shared effort, much as Astropy is meant to for the widerastronomy Python ecosystem. This broader effort is outlined in the`APE13 document &lt;https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/main/APE13.rst&gt;`_.Note that Specutils is not intended to meet all possible spectroscopic analysis orreduction needs. While it provides some standard analysis functionality(following the  Python philosophy of &quot;batteries included&quot;), it is best thoughtof as a &quot;tool box&quot; that provides pieces of functionality that can be used tobuild a particular scientific workflow or higher-level analysis tool.  To thatend, it is also meant to facilitate connecting together disparate reductionpipelines and analysis tools through shared Python representations ofspectroscopic data.Getting Started with Specutils------------------------------For details on installing and using Specutils, see the`specutils documentation &lt;http://specutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_.Note that Specutils now only supports Python 3. While some functionality maycontinue to work on Python 2, it is not tested and support cannot be guaranteed(due to the sunsetting of Python 2 support by the Python and Astropy developmentteams).License-------This project is Copyright (c) Specutils Developers and licensed underthe terms of the BSD 3-Clause license. This package is based uponthe `Astropy package template &lt;https://github.com/astropy/package-template&gt;`_which is licensed under the BSD 3-clause license. See the ``licenses`` folder formore information.Contributing------------We love contributions! specutils is open source,built on open source, and we'd love to have you hang out in our community.**Imposter syndrome disclaimer**: We want your help. No, really.There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're notready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly goodenough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code atall, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open sourceprojects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect codeisn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it'strying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from thosemistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You canhelp out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about theproject (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contributionprocess). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project asa whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can seethe errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.Note: This disclaimer was originally written by`Adrienne Lowe &lt;https://github.com/adriennefriend&gt;`_ for a`PyCon talk &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uj746j9Heo&gt;`_, and was adapted byspecutils based on its use in the README file for the`MetPy project &lt;https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy&gt;`_.If you locally cloned this repo before 22 Mar 2021--------------------------------------------------The primary branch for this repo has been transitioned from ``master`` to ``main``.  If you have a local clone of this repository and want to keep your local branch in sync with this repo, you'll need to do the following in your local clone from your terminal::   git fetch --all --prune   # you can stop here if you don't use your local &quot;master&quot;/&quot;main&quot; branch   git branch -m master main   git branch -u origin/main mainIf you are using a GUI to manage your repos you'll have to find the equivalent commands as it's different for different programs. Alternatively, you can just delete your local clone and re-clone!</longdescription>
