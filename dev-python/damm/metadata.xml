	<longdescription>Damm algorithm decimal check digit----------------------------------Note that check digits are NOT used for verification of data transfers betweencomputers -- use a CRC or a hash for that purpose! Check digits are used tocheck *manual* entry of a digit into a computer system.A Damm check digit is a single check digit that can detect anysingle-digit error as well as any adjacent-digit transpositions. The digitcomputed in this module also detects some important phonetic errors (13&lt;-&gt;30,14&lt;-&gt;40, ... 19&lt;--&gt;90).This makes the Damm check digit better than other, more well-known check digitslike the Luhn code (used in credit cards) and the ISBN base-11 check digit. Itis equal in detection strength to a Verhoeff check digit, but much simpler tocompute.Furthermore, a hexadecimal Damm check digit was added. This single hexadecimalcheck digit that detects every single-digit error as well as any adjacent-digittranspositions. The digit computed in this module also detects some importantphonetic errors (13&lt;-&gt;30, 14&lt;-&gt;40, ... 19&lt;--&gt;90). It also detects alljump-transposition errors (abc -&gt; cba), 93.5 % of all twin digit errors (aa -&gt;bb) and 93.5 % of all jump twin digit errors (aca -&gt; bcb).There are four functions in this module: `encode`, `encode16`, `check` and`check16`. The first two, `encode` and `encode16` are used to calculate thecheck digit for a number that you have. Pass in a string with the number youwant encoded and get a string with the check digit back. The other two, `check`and `check16` are used to check that a number that was entered was enteredcorrectly. Pass in a string with a number including check digit and get back`True`/`False`.Damm algorithm--------------The Damm check digit is computed by starting with a check digit of zero and thencontinually multiplying this check digit with the digits of a given number,using the multiplication of a totally anti-symmetric quasigroup. The propertiesand the selection of the group ensure the qualities of the check digit statedabove.For further reference on how the algorithm works seehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damm_algorithm    License information-------------------Copyright (C) 2013 Johannes SpielmannThis module, `damm`, is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public Licenses as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.For a full description of the license, please see the file  LICENSE</longdescription>
