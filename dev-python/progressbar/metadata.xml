	<longdescription>Text progress bar library for Python.A text progress bar is typically used to display the progress of a longrunning operation, providing a visual cue that processing is underway.The ProgressBar class manages the current progress, and the format of the lineis given by a number of widgets. A widget is an object that may displaydifferently depending on the state of the progress bar. There are three typesof widgets: - a string, which always shows itself - a ProgressBarWidget, which may return a different value every time its   update method is called - a ProgressBarWidgetHFill, which is like ProgressBarWidget, except it   expands to fill the remaining width of the line.The progressbar module is very easy to use, yet very powerful. It will alsoautomatically enable features like auto-resizing when the system supports it.</longdescription>
