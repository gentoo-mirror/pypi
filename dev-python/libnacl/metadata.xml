	<longdescription>==============Python libnacl==============This library is used to gain direct access to the functions exposed byDaniel J. Bernstein's nacl library via libsodium. It hasbeen constructed to maintain extensive documentation on how to use naclas well as being completely portable. The file in libnacl/__init__.pycan be pulled out and placed directly in any project to give a single filebinding to all of nacl.Higher Level Classes====================The libnacl code also ships with many high level classes which make naclcryptography easy and safe, for documentation please see:http://libnacl.readthedocs.org/Why libnacl===========There are a number of libraries out there binding to libsodium, so why makelibnacl?1. libnacl does not have any non-python hard deps outside of libsodium2. libnacl does not need to be compiled3. libnacl is easy to package and very portable4. Inclusion of high level pythonic encryption classes5. Ability to have a single embeddable and transferable bindings file   that can be added directly to python applications without needing   to dep libnaclThis makes libnacl very portable, very easy to use and easy to distribute.Install=======The libnacl code is easiy installed via a setup.py from the source or via pip.From Source:.. code-block:: bash    tar xvf libnacl-1.5.2.tar.gz    cd libnacl-1.5.2    python setup.py installVia Pip:.. code-block:: bash    pip install libnaclRemember that libnacl can be installed for python 2 and 3.Linux distributions-------------------Libnacl is shiped with many linux distributions, check your distributionpackage manager for the package ``python-libnacl``, ``python2-libnacl``and/or ``python3-libnacl``.</longdescription>
