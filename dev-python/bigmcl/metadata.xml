	<longdescription># bigmcl## Large scale Markov clustering (MCL) via subgraph extraction    `bigmcl` will isolate disconnected subgraphs from a large graph file and executeMCL on the subgraphs. bigmcl enables MCL on large, highly disconnected graphs, such as those used in orthogroup inference. Not recommended for graphs that are manageable with typical MCL.Important to note that the inflation parameter is affected by this approach -I have noted clusters are more granular if anything. In the future, I plan onimplementing a systematic approach option for identifying ideal inflations foreach subgraph.Please cite this git repository and MCL when this software contributes to your analysis.## DISCLAIMER`bigmcl` is currently in a beta state, and while I appreciate bringing issues tomy attention, I am currently focused on getting things working well for my ownresearch, so I cannot guarantee timely issue resolution. My hope is `bigmcl` willbe in a longterm stable state by publication 2022.&lt;br /&gt;## INSTALL```pip install bigmcl```Clone `mcl` [from here](https://github.com/micans/mcl), compile, and add to your path.&lt;br /&gt;## USEInput and go:```bigmcl -i &lt;GRAPH.imx&gt; -I 1.5```More elaborate options:```usage: bigmcl.py [-h] -i INPUT -I INFLATION [-s] [-r ROW_FILE] [-m] [-o OUTPUT] [-c CORES]                 [-v]Isolates disconnected graphs and runs MCL on the subgraphs.
