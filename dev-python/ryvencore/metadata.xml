	<longdescription>&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;./docs/img/logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;drawing&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;An experimental Python library for graph-based processing, designed for flow-based/node-based visual scripting editors. It is the backbone of the [Ryven](https://github.com/leon-thomm/Ryven) project, but it can very much be used in other contexts as well.While ryvencore is written purely in Python, it is very lightweight and highly compatible. It can be compiled with Cython, see the `setup_cython.py` file. The performance seems comparable so far, but the code hasn't been optimized for Cython yet, so there might be a lot of potential. Please consider contributing. ryvencore also seems compatible with most Python ports to WebAssembly, even the Cython compiled ryvencore.### Installation```pip install ryvencore```or from sources:```git clone https://github.com/leon-thomm/ryvencorecd ryvencorepip install .```### UsageAs an experimental library, the API is not fully stable and small breaking changes over time should be expected. Generally, the API is defined by what is included in the [docs](https://leon-thomm.github.io/ryvencore/).### Examples**loading a project** e.g. exported from Ryven```pythonimport ryvencore as rcimport jsonimport sysif __name__ == '__main__':    # project file path    fpath = sys.args[1]    # read project file    with open(fpath, 'r') as f:        project: dict = json.loads(f.read())    # run ryvencore    session = rc.Session()    session.load(project)    # access the first flow    f = session.flows[0]        # and the last node that was created    my_node = f.nodes[-1]    # and execute it    my_node.update()```### FeaturesThe main features include- **load &amp; save** from and into JSON- **a simple and powerful nodes system** which lets you do anything, simple and unrestricted- **data *and* exec flow support** - unlike lots of other solutions out there, ryvencore supports exec flows- **variables system** with subscribe and update mechanism to build nodes that automatically adapt to change of data- **built-in logging** based on python's `logging` module- **actions system for nodes** (WIP)### Licensingryvencore is licensed under the [LGPL License](github.com/leon-thomm/ryvencore/blob/master/LICENSE).</longdescription>
