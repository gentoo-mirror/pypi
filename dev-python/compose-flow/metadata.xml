	<longdescription># Compose FlowThis utility is built on top of [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and [Swarm Mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).  It establishes workflow conventions that are easily shared between team members -- and butlers -- who need to manage and deploy services, including:- managing [Stacks](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part5/#prerequisites) across multiple Swarms (e.g. separate dev and prod Swarms)- connecting to and working with service containers- building and publishing images- sharing service configuration between team members## Installation```pip install compose-flow```## Compose-Flow configurationCreate the file `~/.compose/config.yml` with the following sections.### Build```yamlbuild:  # the image prefix can be your Docker Hub username or a private registry address  image_prefix: myprivateregistry.com```### Remotes```yamlremotes:  local:    backend: swarm  test:    backend: rancher    rancher:      project: Ops      cluster: prod  dev:    backend: rancher  prod:    backend: rancher```With this in place you're ready to go onto your project setup.# A basic exampleThis is the most basic file to get started.Place this at `compose/compose-flow.yml` in your project directory:```profiles:  local:    - docker-compose.yml```Alongside it, place the file `compose/docker-compose.yml`:```version: '3.7'services:  app:    build: ..    image: ${DOCKER_IMAGE}```For building, run: `compose-flow build`.For publishing: `compose-flow publish`.For deploying as configured above: `compose-flow -e local deploy`.More information at [docs/advanced.md](docs/advanced.md)</longdescription>
