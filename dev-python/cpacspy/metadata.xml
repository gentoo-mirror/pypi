It simplify the handling of AeroMaps.CPACS is a *Common Parametric Aircraft Configuration Schema*. It is a data definition for the air transportation system which is developed by the German Aerospace Center [DLR](https://www.dlr.de/). CPACS enables engineers to exchange information between their tools.AeroMaps contains aerodynamic coefficients and derivatives for a specific set of aerodynamic and configurative boundary conditions.## Installation`cpacspy` depend mainly in DLR libraries [TIXI](https://github.com/DLR-SC/tixi) and [TIGL](https://github.com/DLR-SC/tigl), they must be installed on your computer to use `cpacspy`. The easiest way to do so, is to use a Conda environment, to create one:- Install [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) if you don't already have one of them installed.- Clone this repository and create a Conda environment with the following commands:```bashgit clone https://github.com/cfsengineering/cpacspy.gitcd cpacspyconda env create -f environment.ymlconda activate cpacspy_env```- When it is done or if you already have TIXI and TIGL install on your computer:```bashpip install cpacspy```## How to use this packageTo see how to use this module, check out:- Python file with examples of useage:  [cpacspy_use.py](./examples/cpacspy_use.py)- Jupyter Notebook with examples of useage: [cpacspy_use.ipynb](./examples/cpacspy_use.ipynb)## For developers### To build and install locally```bashcd cpacspypython -m buildpip install --user .```### To run tests locally```bashcd cpacspy./run_ci.sh```It should run:- Black- Flake8- Pytest- Codecov## License**License:** [Apache-2.0](./LICENSE.txt)</longdescription>
