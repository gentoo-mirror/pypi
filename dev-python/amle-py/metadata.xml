	<longdescription>Amstrad Learning Environment============================The Amstrad Learning Environment is a Python interface that is meant to be used with AIs and OpenAi Gym. The Python library isavailable on Linux and Windows.Installation============Unix----First you'll need to install Python3 (version &gt;= 3.6). To install Python :.. code-block:: console    $ sudo apt-get install python3To check the version :.. code-block:: console    $ python3 --versionThen, you'll need to install pip, so you can install the amle-py package :.. code-block:: console    $ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | pythonWith pip, you'll need to install two dependencies :.. code-block:: console    $ pip install --upgrade setuptools    $ pip install --upgrade numpyFinally you can install amle-py :.. code-block:: console    $ pip install --upgrade amle-pyWindows-------Install Python by going on their `website &lt;https://www.python.org/downloads/&gt;`_. Make sure to add Python to your path and install pip during the installation.How to use==========Compile and use the sources (Linux only)----------------------------------------To compile the sources you will need to install a few dependencies :- SDL 1.2- libpng- libzip- cppunitOnce you have all these dependencies, you can compile the project. You may also want to generate the documentation of the project, this is done in the doc/ folder. Make sure to have doxygen installed :.. code-block:: console    $ sudo apt-get install doxygenAnd then :.. code-block:: console    $ doxygen doxygen.configUse the Python library----------------------First you will need to create a new Python file in which you import the library :.. code-block:: python    import amle_pyThen you will need to create a new amle object :.. code-block:: python    amle = amle_py.AmLEInterface()And you will need to load a game :.. code-block:: python    amle.loadSnapshot(&quot;Arkanoid&quot;, &quot;snap/arka.sna&quot;)Note that the first string has to a name the AmLE can understand. If you have a doubt you can get the list of all possible strings with :.. code-block:: python    games = amle.getSupportedGames()Moreover, the second argument is a path to YOUR .sna file. You have to import one from the internet and generate one yourself with an emulator. Also, it doesn't have to be in a snap/ folder, this is just cleaner.Then you may want to run the game :.. code-block:: python    while not(amle.gameOver()):        amle.step()This doesn't do anything interesting though, you can also interact with the game. To do so, before the loop you can do :.. code-block:: python    nbLegalActions = amle.getNbLegalActions()    legalActions = np.empty(nbLegalActions, dtype=np.int32)    amle.getLegalActions(legalActions)    legalActions = legalActions.tolist()And then in the loop :.. code-block:: python    import amle_py    import random    # The previous code discussed    while not(amle.gameOver()):        amle.act(random.choice(legalActions))        amle.step()Finally, you may want to generate the documentation for the library. To do so go in the amle_py folder and run :.. code-block:: console    $ pydoc -w amle_python_interface.py</longdescription>
