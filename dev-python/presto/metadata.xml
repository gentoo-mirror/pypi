The REpertoire Sequencing TOolkit (pRESTO) is composed of asuite of utilities to handle all stages of sequence processing prior to germlinesegment assignment. pRESTO is designed to handle either single reads orpaired-end reads. It includes features for quality control, primer masking,annotation of reads with sequence embedded barcodes, generation ofunique molecular identifier (UMI) consensus sequences, assembly of paired-end reads and identification of duplicate sequences. Numerous options for sequence sorting, sampling and conversion operations are also included.</longdescription>
