	<longdescription># Tagreader #Tagreader is a Python package for reading trend data from the OSIsoftPI and Aspen Infoplus.21 IMS systems. It is intended to be easy to use,and present as similar interfaces as possible to the backend historians.While originally developed for Windows, Tagreader can since release 3.0.0also be used on Linux and Windows platforms.Queries can be performed using either REST API (preferred) or ODBC queries.The use of ODBC queries require installation of proprietary drivers fromAspenTech and OSIsoft that are only available for Windows.Trend data is output as Pandas Dataframes. The HDF5 file format is usedto cache results.## RequirementsPython &gt;=3.7 with the following packages:  + pandas &gt;= 1.0.0  + tables (*)  + requests  + requests-kerberos  + certifi &gt;= 2020.04.05  + pyodbc (**)*) If tables is not installed, caching of fetched data will be disabled.Tables will be installed alongside Tagreader unless the installation isknown to fail, which is the case for Macs with M1 chip.**) If using ODBC connections, you must also install proprietary drivers forPI ODBC and/or Aspen IP.21 SQLPlus. These drivers are only available forMicrosoft Windows. Pyodbc will therefore not be installed for non-Windowssystems.## InstallationTo install and/or upgrade:```pip install --upgrade tagreader```## Usage example ##```import tagreaderc = tagreader.IMSClient(&quot;mysource&quot;, &quot;aspenone&quot;)print(c.search(&quot;tag*&quot;))df = c.read_tags([&quot;tag1&quot;, &quot;tag2&quot;], &quot;18.06.2020 08:00:00&quot;, &quot;18.06.2020 09:00:00&quot;, 60)```Also see the[quickstart](https://github.com/equinor/tagreader-python/blob/master/docs/quickstart.ipynb)document and the[manual](docs/https://github.com/equinor/tagreader-python/blob/master/docs/manual.md)for more information.</longdescription>
