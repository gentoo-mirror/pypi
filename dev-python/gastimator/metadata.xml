	<longdescription># GAStimator[![Python 3.8](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/gastimator.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/gastimator) Implementation of a Python MCMC gibbs-sampler with adaptive stepping. While this is a simple MCMC algorithm, it is robust and stable and well suited to high dimensional problems with many degrees of freedom and very sharp likelihood features. For instance kinematic modelling of datacubes with this code has been found to be orders of magnitude quicker than using more advanced affine-invariant MCMC methods. ### InstallYou can install GAStimator with `pip install gastimator`. Alternatively you can download the code here, navigate to the directory you unpack it too, and run `python setup.py install`.    It requires the following modules:* numpy* matplotlib* plotbin* joblib### DocumentationTo get you started, see the walk through here: https://github.com/TimothyADavis/GAStimator/blob/master/documentation/GAStimator_Documentation.ipynbAuthor &amp; License-----------------Copyright 2019 Timothy A.
