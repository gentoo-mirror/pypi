	<longdescription># Frinx Python SDKThis package contains implementation of [Workflow Manager](https://docs.frinx.io/frinx-workflow-manager/introduction/)client, building blocks for task and workflow definitions and ready-to-use implementations of tasks and workflows,which cover basic use cases of [FRINX MACHINE](https://docs.frinx.io/) components.## Environment set up1. Install poetry    ```sh    sudo apt-get -y install pipx    pipx install poetry    ```2. Install dependencies     ```sh    poetry install    ```## How to contribute1. Create new feature branch.   ```sh   git checkout -b &lt;branch_name&gt;   ```2. Add your changes.   ```sh   git add &lt;file&gt;   ```3. OPTIONAL - Run pre-commit. Pre-commit triggers linting and static type checker hooks. These checks are also   triggered by GitHub actions when a PR is created or updated. All errors and warnings raised by linters and   type checkers must be fixed before the PR can be merged.   ```sh   poetry shell   pre-commit   ```4. Commit your changes. We do not enforce commit message structure, but you should follow these   [best practices](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).   ```sh   git commit   ```5. Push your branch to remote repository.   ```sh   git push -u origin &lt;branch_name&gt;   ```</longdescription>
