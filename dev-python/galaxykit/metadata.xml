	<longdescription>## GalaxykitGalaxykit is a client library for [galaxy\_ng](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy_ng), designed for use in internal testing.It's intended to be a low-dependency and low-abstraction client for performing actions on a remote Automation Hub or galaxy\_ng instance.### Installing:To install the latest development version, run `pip install -e .` in the root of your checked-out copy of this repository.To set up the pre-commit hooks we are using (currently just autoformatting with `black`), run the following snippet:```bashpre-commit installpre-commit install-hooks```After that's been done, the first commit you make will have to install any of those dependencies, and may take a few minutes.</longdescription>
