Structs are provided as Python classes,with Pythonic initialization and deletion semantics.It is not the aim of this package to provide fully fledgedscene/environment/game authoring API, as there are already a number of existingpackages that do this well. However, this package does provide a number oflower-level components outside of MuJoCo itself that are likely to be useful tomost users who access MuJoCo through Python. For example, the `egl`, `glfw`, and`osmesa` subpackages contain utilities for setting up OpenGL rendering contexts.## InstallationThe recommended way to install this package is via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mujoco/):```shpip install mujoco```A copy of the MuJoCo library is provided as part of the package and does **not**need to be downloaded or installed separately.### Source**IMPORTANT:** Building from source is only necessary if you are modifying thePython bindings (or are trying to run on exceptionally old Linux systems).If that's not the case, then we recommend installing the prebuilt binaries fromPyPI.If you need to build the Python bindings from source, please consult[the documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python.html#building-from-source).## UsageOnce installed, the package can be imported via `import mujoco`. Please consultour [documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python.html) forfurther detail on the package's API.We recommend going through the tutorial notebook which covers the basics ofMuJoCo using Python:[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/python/tutorial.ipynb)## VersioningThe `major.minor.micro` portion of the version number matches the version ofMuJoCo that the bindings provide. Optionally, if we release updates to thePython bindings themselves that target the same version of MuJoCo, a `.postN`suffix is added, for example `2.1.2.post2` represents the second update to thebindings for MuJoCo 2.1.2.## License and DisclaimerCopyright 2022 DeepMind Technologies LimitedMuJoCo and its Python bindings are licensed under the Apache License,Version 2.0.

You must inform recipients that the SourceCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of thisLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may notattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source CodeForm.3.2. Distribution of Executable FormIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.3.3.
