Choosing and combiningdetection algorithms (detectors), feature engineering methods (transformers),and ensemble methods (aggregators) properly is the key to build an effectiveanomaly detection model.This package offers a set of common detectors, transformers and aggregatorswith unified APIs, as well as pipe classes that connect them together intomodels. It also provides some functions to process and visualize time seriesand anomaly events.See https://adtk.readthedocs.io for complete documentation.## InstallationPrerequisites: Python 3.5 or later.It is recommended to install the most recent **stable** release of ADTK from PyPI.```shellpip install adtk```Alternatively, you could install from source code. This will give you the **latest**, but unstable, version of ADTK.```shellgit clone https://github.com/arundo/adtk.gitcd adtk/git checkout developpip install ./```## ExamplesPlease see [Quick Start](https://adtk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html) for a simple example.For more detailed examples of each module of ADTK, please refer to[Examples](https://adtk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html)section in the documentation or [an interactive demo notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/arundo/adtk/master?filepath=docs%2Fnotebooks%2Fdemo.ipynb).## ContributingPull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first todiscuss what you would like to change.Please make sure to update unit tests as appropriate.Please see [Contributing](https://adtk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer.html) for more details.## LicenseADTK is licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0).
