	<longdescription># Python library to control BenQ projectorsPython library to control BenQ projectors over the serial interface.BenQ projectors and flat pannels with a serial port can support one of threeprotocols. This plugin supports projectors which are of the L, P, T, W and Xseries but probably also others.## ProtocolThis are the protocol details:2400 baud 8N1```&lt;CR&gt;*&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;#&lt;CR&gt;```Where `&lt;CR&gt;` is a Carriage ReturnExamples:  Power on   : `&lt;CR&gt;*pow=on#&lt;CR&gt;`  Power off  : `&lt;CR&gt;*pow=off#&lt;CR&gt;`  Source HDMI: `&lt;CR&gt;*sour=hdmi#&lt;CR&gt;`  The same commands should work over a network connection, but I don't own suchprojector and have not implemented any network functionality. Contact me ifyou have a network connected BenQ projector and like this to work.### PJLinkThis library does **not** implement the PJLink protocol, but a proparitaryBenQ protocol instead. The PJLink protocol is covered by other libraries.## Supported projectorsKnown to work:* W1100* W1110* X3000iNot tested but use te same protocol according to the documentation:  Others in the L, P, T, W and X SeriesNot supported:* RP552* RP552H* RP840G* RP653* RP703* RP750* RP750K* RP652* RP702* RP790S* RP705HPlease let me know if your projectors is also supported by this plugin so Ican improve the overview of supported devices.## InstallationYou can install the Python BenQ projector library using the Python packagemanager PIP:  `pip3 install benqprojector`## benqprojector CLIYou can use the Python BenQ projector library directly from the command lineto turn on and off your projector using the following syntax:Status of the projector: `python3 -m benqprojector &lt;serial port&gt; &lt;baud&gt; status`  Turn on the projector: `python3 -m benqprojector &lt;serial port&gt; &lt;baud&gt; on`  Turn off the projector: `python3 -m benqprojector &lt;serial port&gt; &lt;baud&gt; off`### Detecting your projector capabilitiesThe benqprojector CLI can detect the commands, sources and modes yourprojector supports. If you like to have your projector fully supported by thisPython library please run this command and create an issue on Github with theoutput attached.To examine your projector capabilities: `python3 -m benqprojector &lt;serial port&gt; &lt;baud&gt; examine`Your projector needs to be on to be able to detact all your projectorcapabilities.Do you enjoy using this Python library? Then consider supporting my work:\[&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Buy Me A Coffee&quot; style=&quot;height: 60px !important;width: 217px !important;&quot; &gt;](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rrooggiieerr)  </longdescription>
