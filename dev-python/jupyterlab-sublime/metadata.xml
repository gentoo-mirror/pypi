I have adapted a few keybindings I find the most useful, more to follow soon. Consult the [checklist](sublimeKeyChecklist.md) for more details.## Why opinionated?There are some keybindings I simply don't feel useful, so I have repurposed them, again see the [checklist](https://github.com/ryantam626/jupyterlab_sublime/blob/master/sublimeKeyChecklist.md).Also I have implemented some extra commands which might collide with other user's shortcuts, see [my list](https://github.com/ryantam626/jupyterlab_sublime/blob/master/myKeys.md).## Prerequisites* JupyterLab## Installation```bashjupyter labextension install @ryantam626/jupyterlab_sublime```## DevelopmentFor a development install (requires npm version 4 or later), do the following in the repository directory:```bashnpm installnpm run buildjupyter labextension link .```To rebuild the package and the JupyterLab app:```bashnpm run buildjupyter lab build```</longdescription>
