It's built on top of the [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc) probabilistic programming framework, and is designed to make it extremely easy to fit mixed-effects models common in social sciences settings using a Bayesian approach.## InstallationBambi requires a working Python interpreter (3.8+). We recommend installing Python and key numerical libraries using the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads), which has one-click installers available on all major platforms.Assuming a standard Python environment is installed on your machine (including pip), Bambi itself can be installed in one line using pip:    pip install bambiAlternatively, if you want the bleeding edge version of the package you can install from GitHub:    pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git### DependenciesBambi requires working versions of ArviZ, formulae, NumPy, pandas and PyMC. Dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml` and should all be installed by the Bambi installer; no further action should be required.## ExampleIn the following two examples we assume the following basic setup```pythonimport bambi as bmbimport numpy as npimport pandas as pddata = pd.DataFrame({    &quot;y&quot;: np.random.normal(size=50),    &quot;g&quot;: np.random.choice([&quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;], size=50),    &quot;x1&quot;: np.random.normal(size=50),    &quot;x2&quot;: np.random.normal(size=50)})```### Linear regression```pythonmodel = bmb.Model(&quot;y ~ x1 + x2&quot;, data)fitted = model.fit()```In the first line we create and build a Bambi `Model`. The second line tells the sampler to startrunning and it returns an `InferenceData` object, which can be passed to several ArviZ functionssuch as `az.summary()` to get a summary of the parameters distribution and sample diagnostics or `az.plot_trace()` to visualize them.### Logistic regressionHere we just add the `family` argument set to `&quot;bernoulli&quot;` to tell Bambi we are modelling a binaryresponse. By default, it uses a logit link. We can also use some syntax sugar to specify which eventwe want to model. We just say `g['Yes']` and Bambi will understand we want to model the probabilityof a `&quot;Yes&quot;` response. But this notation is not mandatory. If we use `&quot;g ~ x1 + x2&quot;`, Bambi willpick one of the events to model and will inform us which one it picked.```pythonmodel = bmb.Model(&quot;g['Yes'] ~ x1 + x2&quot;, data, family=&quot;bernoulli&quot;)fitted = model.fit()```## DocumentationThe Bambi documentation can be found in the [official docs](https://bambinos.github.io/bambi/index.html)## CitationIf you use Bambi and want to cite it please use```@article{Capretto2022, title={Bambi: A Simple Interface for Fitting Bayesian Linear Models in Python}, volume={103}, url={https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v103i15}, doi={10.18637/jss.v103.i15}, number={15}, journal={Journal of Statistical Software}, author={Capretto, Tomás and Piho, Camen and Kumar, Ravin and Westfall, Jacob and Yarkoni, Tal and Martin, Osvaldo A}, year={2022}, pages={1–29}}```## ContributionsBambi is a community project and welcomes contributions.
