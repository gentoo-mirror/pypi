	<longdescription># Nipype 1 legacy workflowsThis package includes the workflows built up over nearly a decade of development of[Nipype](https://nipy.org/nipype/).These workflows were contributed by various users and developers, and are more-or-less tied to thespecific contexts, in terms of available tools and interfaces, as well as consensus best practices,at the time each was developed. It is laborious to identify which have been updated to accommodatechanges in underlying software or changing ideas of best practice, and which serve primarily as apublic record of a particular effort.The Nipype developers have decided to initiate the [niflows](https://github.com/niflows) project,which will allow new workflows, or collections of workflows, to be separately packaged and madeavailable under a common interface and in a common namespace. This will permit each niflowrepository and associated package to describe its history in a natural way, and the level ofmaintenance of a package will not be obscured by the development process of nipype itself.This package serves as an example niflow. In general, it exists as a historical record, and updatesto this package will be for the sake of further developing niflows. If a bug is found in one ofthese workflows that was not introduced by moving the workflows out of nipype, then the preferredresponse is to publish a new niflow.</longdescription>
