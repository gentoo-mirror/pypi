	<longdescription># validataclass[![Unit tests](https://github.com/binary-butterfly/validataclass/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/binary-butterfly/validataclass/actions/workflows/tests.yml)Python library for input validation designed for (but not restricted to) JSON-based APIs, neatly integrating with dataclasses.**Status:** Beta.## Installationvalidataclass is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/validataclass/).To install it using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/), just run:```shellpip install validataclass```If you add the package to your dependencies, it is recommended to use [compatible release](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#compatible-release)version specifiers to make sure you always get the latest version of the library but without running into breaking changes:```shellpip install validataclass~=0.8```However, keep in mind that the library still is in its beta phase (as indicated by the major version of 0). There canand will be smaller breaking changes between 0.x minor versions, but we will try to keep them at a minimum and save themfor the release of version 1.0.0.## UsageSee [`docs/`](https://github.com/binary-butterfly/validataclass/blob/main/docs/index.md) for documentation on how to use this library andfor examples.(**Note:** The documentation is mostly done now, but still a work in progress.)## Development### Virtual environmentTo setup a virtualenv for development of the library, run `make venv`.Alternatively you can manually run the following commands (which do the same as the make target):```$ virtualenv venv$ source venv/bin/activate$ pip install -r requirements.txt$ pip install -e .```### Running unit testsUnit tests can be run using `make tox` or by directly executing `tox`.For this to work you need to either be inside the virtualenv (see above) or to have [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/) installedin your system locally.</longdescription>
