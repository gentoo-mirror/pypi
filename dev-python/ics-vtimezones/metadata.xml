	<longdescription># ics.py vTimezone DataThis project independently packages the timezone data required by [`ics.py`](https://github.com/C4ptainCrunch/ics.py).It includes the [Olson / IANA timezone Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) converted to [iCalender vTimezone](https://icalendar.org/iCalendar-RFC-5545/3-6-5-time-zone-component.html) files by [vzic](https://github.com/libical/vzic/)and the [Unicode CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/index) mapping of [Windows timezone names](http://cldr.unicode.org/development/development-process/design-proposals/extended-windows-olson-zid-mapping) to the Olson identifiers.Having a separate project from ics.py allows regular releases when the timezone data changes(which is not as seldom as you might think) without having to do a new release of `ics.py`.Similar to `pytz`, this project follows the `YYYY.minor` [calendar versioning](https://calver.org/) scheme representing the periodic updates of its data,while `ics.py` uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to allow ensuring compatibility with its more gradually evolving code-base.## LicenseThe source code of the project itself and the IANA time zone database are in the public domain,while the Unicode CLDR Windows timezone name mapping file is under the [Unicode, inc. license agreement for data files and software](https://www.unicode.org/license.html), having the following copyright notice:&gt; Copyright Â© 1991-2013 Unicode, Inc.&gt; CLDR data files are interpreted according to the LDML specification (http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/)&gt; For terms of use, see http://www.unicode.org/copyright.html</longdescription>
