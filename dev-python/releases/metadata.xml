It's compatible with Python 3.6+, and maywork on Sphinx versions as far back as 1.8.x, though 4.x and up arerecommended and generally all we will support.Specifically:* The source format (kept in your Sphinx tree as ``changelog.rst``) is a  stream-like timeline that plays well with source control &amp; only requires one  entry per change (even for changes that exist in multiple release lines).* The output (when you have the extension installed and run your Sphinx build  command) is a traditional looking changelog page with a section for every  release; multi-release issues are copied automatically into each release.* By default, feature and support issues are only displayed under feature  releases, and bugs are only displayed under bugfix releases. This can be  overridden on a per-issue basis.Some background on why this tool was created can be found in `this blog post&lt;http://bitprophet.org/blog/2013/09/14/a-better-changelog/&gt;`_.For more documentation, please see http://releases.readthedocs.io. For aroadmap, see the maintainer's `roadmap page&lt;http://bitprophet.org/projects#roadmap&gt;`_... note::    You can install the development version via ``pip install -e    git+https://github.com/bitprophet/releases/#egg=releases``.</longdescription>
