	<longdescription># HotsosUse hotsos to implement repeatable analysis and extract useful information from common cloud applications and subsystems. Write analysis Scenarios using a high-level language and helpful Python libraries. A catalog of analysis implementations is included.The design of hotsos is oriented around “plugins” that provide easy access to the state of applications and subsystems. Hotsos is run against a Data Root which can either be the host it is run on or a sosreport. The output is a summary containing key information from each plugin along with any issuses or known bugs detected and suggestions on what actions can be taken to handle them.## DocumentationInstallation and Usage: https://hotsos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/index.htmlContributing: https://hotsos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contrib/index.htmlFull documentation: https://hotsos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</longdescription>
