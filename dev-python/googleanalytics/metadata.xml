	<longdescription>Google Analytics for Python and the command-line================================================|Build Status|``google-analytics`` takes the pain out of working with the GoogleAnalytics reporting APIs. It supports both the Core and the Real TimeAPI. It is written in Python but there's also a full-featuredcommand-line interface.-  **Authentication.** OAuth2 is a bit of a pain and we've made it   easier, both for interactive use and for `server   applications &lt;https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/blob/master/examples/server.py&gt;`__.   We can also save your credentials in the operating system's keychain   if you want to.-  **Querying.** Easier to query per week, month or year. Query using   metric IDs or using their full names, whichever you think is nicer.   Work with both the Core and the Real Time APIs.-  **Reporting.** Generate reports from the command-line. Optionally   describe reports and queries in `easy-to-read and easy-to-write YAML   files &lt;https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/blob/master/examples/query.yml&gt;`__.   Reports in Python work better too: iterate through the entire report   or column-per-column.-  **Exploration.** Traverse the account hierarchy from account to   webproperty to profile to dimensions, both programmatically and with   the included command-line interface.-  **Exports.** Clean JSON and CSV – as well as   `Pandas &lt;http://pandas.pydata.org/&gt;`__ data frames – so you can   analyze the data in anything from Excel to R.This package is built on top of `Google's own API client forPython &lt;https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/installation&gt;`__.Quickstart----------First, install the package using`pip &lt;https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/&gt;`__-  Python 2: ``pip install googleanalytics``-  Python 3: ``pip3 install googleanalytics``Then, create a new project in the `Google DevelopersConsole &lt;https://console.developers.google.com&gt;`__, enable the AnalyticsAPI under &quot;APIs &amp; auth &gt; APIs&quot; and generate credentials for an installedapplication under &quot;APIs &amp; auth &gt; Credentials&quot;. Keep this page open. Formore detail, look at the `wiki page onauthentication &lt;https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/Authentication&gt;`__.After that, executing your first query is as easy as.. code:: python    import googleanalytics as ga    accounts = ga.authenticate()    profile = accounts[0].webproperties[0].profile    pageviews = profile.core.query.metrics('pageviews').range('yesterday').value    print(pageviews)Or on the command-line, that'd be:.. code:: shell    googleanalytics --identity &lt;identity&gt; --account &lt;account&gt; --webproperty &lt;webproperty&gt; \        query pageviews --start yesterdayThe account, webproperty and profile determine what data you'll bequerying. Learn more about profiles and querying on the`Querying &lt;https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/Querying&gt;`__wiki page, or alternatively look at the `CommonQueries &lt;https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/Common-Queries&gt;`__page for lots of examples. Read more about how to work with theresulting data in `Working WithReports &lt;https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/Working-With-Reports&gt;`__.`On TheCommand-Line &lt;https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/On-The-Command-Line&gt;`__has more details about the command-line application.The example above will authorize the app and authenticate youinteractively. It is also possible to pass credentials as arguments inPython, using environment variables or from your operating system'skeychain. Authentication is treated in much more depth on the`authentication wikipage &lt;https://github.com/debrouwere/google-analytics/wiki/Authentication&gt;`__... |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/debrouwere/google-analytics.svg   :target: https://travis-ci.org/debrouwere/google-analytics</longdescription>
