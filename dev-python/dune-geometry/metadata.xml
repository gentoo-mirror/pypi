Using C++ techniques DUNE allows to use verydifferent implementation of the same concept (i.e. grid, solver, ...) undera common interface with a very low overhead.DUNE was designed with flexibility in mind. It supports easy discretizationusing methods, like Finite Elements, Finite Volume and also FiniteDifferences. Through separation of data structures DUNE allows fast LinearAlgebra like provided in the ISTL module, or usage of external librarieslike blas.This package contains the basic DUNE geometry classes.More information----------------Check dune-common for more details concerning dependencies, known bugs,license and installation.git-2cec5b8c5b335df922a121c3e6577e89fc3f4d13</longdescription>
