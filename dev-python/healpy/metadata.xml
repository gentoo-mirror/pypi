It is based on the`Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization (HEALPix) &lt;https://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/&gt;`_scheme and bundles the `HEALPix` C++ library.`HEALPix` was developed to efficiently process Cosmic Microwave Background data from Cosmologyexperiments like BOOMERANG and WMAP but it is now used in other branches of Astrophysics tostore data from all-sky surveys. The target audience used to be primarily the Cosmologyscientific community but currently anyone interested in handling pixelated data on the sphereis very welcome to propose new features.Capabilities------------`healpy` provides utilities to:* convert between sky coordinates and pixel indices in `HEALPix` nested and ring schemes* find pixels within a disk, a polygon or a strip in the sky* apply coordinate transformations between Galactic, Ecliptic and Equatorial reference frames* apply custom rotations either to vectors or full maps* read and write `HEALPix` maps to disk in FITS format* upgrade and downgrade the resolution of existing `HEALPix` maps* visualize maps in Mollweide, Gnomonic and Cartographic projections* transform maps to Spherical Harmonics space and back using multi-threaded C++ routines* compute Auto and Cross Power Spectra from maps and create map realizations from spectraThe documentation can be found at https://healpy.readthedocs.io, tutorial athttps://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html, or execute it on `mybinder &lt;https://mybinder.org/v2/gist/zonca/9c114608e0903a3b8ea0bfe41c96f255/master&gt;`_Requirements------------* `Python &lt;http://www.python.org&gt;`_ 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11* `Numpy &lt;http://numpy.scipy.org/&gt;`_ (tested with version &gt;=1.19)* `Matplotlib &lt;http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/&gt;`_* Python development package is required for some distribution (e.g.,  python-dev package for Ubuntu)* `Astropy &lt;http://www.astropy.org&gt;`_Quick installation with Pip---------------------------The quickest way to install Healpy is with `pip &lt;http://www.pip-installer.org&gt;`_(&gt;= 1.4.2), which automatically fetches the latest version of Healpy and anymissing dependencies::    pip install --user healpyIf you have installed with ``pip``, you can keep your installation up to dateby upgrading from time to time::    pip install --user --upgrade healpySee `INSTALL.rst &lt;https://github.com/healpy/healpy/blob/master/INSTALL.rst&gt;`_for further details and other installation options.Optional--------Healpy depends on the `HEALPix` C++ and cfitsio C libraries. Source code isinclude with Healpy and you do not have to install them separately.However, if you have them installed already, Healpy should detect and reusethem instead of building them from source. To use your own installations of`HEALPix` and cfitsio, you will also need:* `pkg-config &lt;http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org&gt;`_* `HEALPix  &lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/healpix/files/Healpix_3.11/autotools_packages/&gt;`_  autotools-style C++ package* `cfitsio &lt;http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/&gt;`_See `INSTALL.rst &lt;https://github.com/healpy/healpy/blob/master/INSTALL.rst&gt;`_for further instructions.Known issues------------* Building with OpenMP support: the underlying `HEALPix` C++ library can be built  to use `OpenMP &lt;http://openmp.org/wp/&gt;`_ to speed up some operations on  systems with multiple cores. Most, but not all, modern C/C++ compilers support  OpenMP, `the notable exception being clang &lt;http://openmp.llvm.org&gt;`_.  If your Healpy build fails with an error message about being unable to link  against `-lgomp`, then this typically means that Healpy detected an  already-installed `HEALPix` C++ library that was built with OpenMP support, but  you are trying to build Healpy with a compiler that does not support OpenMP.  Try cleaning the build with `python setup.py clean --all`, and set the  environment variables `CC` and `CXX` to point to an OpenMP-capable compiler,  such as gcc/g++.* Healpy does not currently support Windows.  See https://github.com/healpy/healpy/issues/25.* Incompatibility with ``cfitisio`` from ``HEASOFT``: due to a conflict of  header file names it is currently not possible to use the cfitsio library  provided with the HEASOFT package for compilation of `HEALPix` C++. HEASOFT's  include directory contains a file called &quot;rotmatrix.h&quot; which clashes with  `HEALPix`'s own rotmatrix.h.* Compilation problems in the C++ package: some gcc versions (we have reports  for 4.4.5 and 4.4.6) crash with an internal compiler error during compilation  of libsharp. Unfortunately we have not found a workaround for this compiler  problem. To our knowledge, it has been fixed in gcc 4.4.7 and in the 4.5.x  and newer versions.* Healpy pixel functions, e.g. ``ang2pix``, do not support 32-bit platforms.  See https://github.com/healpy/healpy/issues/194.Support-------For specific *HOWTO* questions please create a question on StackOverflow_ andtag it with the `healpy` tag, so that answers will be easily searchable ongoogle.If you think you found a bug or you have install issues, open an issue on GitHub:https://github.com/healpy/healpy/issues.. _StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/askContribute----------Project development takes place on github, http://github.com/healpy/healpy,please open an issue over there for reporting bugs or suggest improvements.Collaboration is very welcome, just fork the project on github and send pullrequests back to the main repository.Developers----------Core developers:* Cyrille Rosset* Andrea Zonca* Martin Reinecke* Leo Singer* Daniel LenzList of contributors: https://github.com/healpy/healpy/graphs/contributorsAcknowledgements----------------1.
