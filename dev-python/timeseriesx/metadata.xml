Almost all the features are actually alreadyprovided by `pandas`_. TimeSeriesX extends the pandas time series functionality by the unit functionalities of `pint`_ and `pint-pandas`_.Further, TimeSeriesX offers an easy and convenient interface to work with time series without the need todig deep into these libraries, which nevertheless is still recommended, since they go way beyond time series data.The main challenges that arise when handling time series data are time zones and frequencies. Since time seriesdata is often obtained by measurements, the values are associated with units. Then these units can be confused easily, sincethe units are often not modeled in code.TimeSeriesX forces the user to handle time zones, frequencies and units explicitly, while taking careof validation and convenient formats. It also supports deriving these attributes from raw time series data.It offers a limited set of actions on time series that are translated to pandas or pint functionality under the hood.It was designed to guarantee that every transformation of time series data results in a new valid time series, whichwould require quite some pandas code if done &quot;manually&quot;.Features--------* model time series data with explicit frequency, time zone and unit* convert time zone or unit* resample data to new frequency* fill and get gaps* join time series* perform calculations on time series with python standard operatorsCredits-------This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template... _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.. _`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.. _`pandas`: https://pandas.pydata.org/.. _`pint`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint.. _`pint-pandas`: https://github.com/hgrecco/pint-pandas=======History=======0.1.13 (2022-07-19)-------------------* fix a few bugs by avoiding `is_compatible_with` in `convert_unit`* raise only `ValueError` instead of `DimensionalityError` on unit dimensionality mismatch* remove `pandas` installation dependency because of transitive dependency via `pint-pandas`* loosen requirements for `pytz` and `dateutil`, no special version requirements known* extend `__getitem__` functionality by supporting iterables of timestamps or positional indices* explicitly support indexing by time zone naive timestamps, which is deprecated by `pandas`* make `coerce_unit` behave like `coerce_freq` and `coerce_time_zone` by passing through `None`0.1.12 (2022-03-16)-------------------* fix equals method* update documentation0.1.11 (2022-03-07)-------------------* fix resampling method to support nan-values* update dependencies0.1.10 (2022-01-21)-------------------* fix equals method* update dependencies0.1.9 (2021-11-19)------------------* allow aggregation functions to return magnitudes or quantities* update dependencies0.1.8 (2021-09-28)------------------* fix time zone bug in gap handling* update dependencies* add more tests0.1.7 (2021-09-28)------------------* improve gap handling* update dependencies* improve documentation* fix calculations with quantity scalar0.1.6 (2021-09-13)------------------* fix time zone issue with UTC in basic calculations for TimestampSeries as 2nd operand* update pint-pandas version dependency* use pint's default unit registry* add support of callables as arguments for frequency resampling* add more tests0.1.5 (2021-09-10)------------------* fix time zone issue with UTC in basic calculations* add round-method for TimestampSeries* fix map-function for series with unit* add more tests0.1.4 (2021-09-09)------------------* improve test coverage* improve TimeSeries equality check* support NaN-removal in as_pd_series-method0.1.3 (2021-09-08)------------------* remove manual timezone checks because it is handled by pandas* fix skipped tests* fix repr() method of TimestampSeries* fix basic calculation with units involved0.1.2 (2021-09-07)------------------* fix timezone handling* First release on PyPI Index.0.1.1 (2021-02-16)------------------* First release on PyPI Test Index.</longdescription>
