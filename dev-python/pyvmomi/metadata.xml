You may have toconfigure multiple python interpreters so that you can test in all theenvironments listed in ``tox.ini`` or you will have to run ``tox`` with the``-e`` flag to run only in your version of python. For example, if you onlyhave Python 2.7 then ``tox -e py27`` will limit your test run to Python 2.7.Contributing============* Research `open issues &lt;https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue&gt;`_* Follow the `contribution standards &lt;https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi/wiki/Contributions&gt;`_Documentation=============For general language neutral documentation of vSphere Management API see:* `vSphere Web Services API Doc &lt;https://code.vmware.com/apis/1720/vsphere&gt;`_Python Support==============* pyVmomi supports Python 3.4+Versioning====================pyVmomi: **X.Y.Z.U.P**vCenter-related:**X.Y** - (Major release), **Z** - (Update release), **U** - (Patch)pyVmomi-related:**P** - (pyVmomi patches)Compatibility Policy====================pyVmomi maintains minimum backward compatibility with the previous*four* releases of *vSphere* and it's own previous four releases.Compatibility with much older versions may continue to work but willnot be actively supported.For example, version v6.0.0 is most compatible with vSphere 6.0, 5.5, 5.1 and5.0. Initial releases compatible with a version of vSphere will bare a nakedversion number of v6.0.0 indicating that version of pyVmomi was releasedsimultaneously with the *GA* version of vSphere with the same version number.Support====================For official support, users with Premium SDK Support, Standard SDK Support and Premier/Success360 customers can reach out to `VMware Global Support &lt;https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87265?lang=en_US&gt;`_ for any issues.For community support, please open a `Github issue &lt;https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi/issues&gt;`_ or start a `Discussion &lt;https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi/discussions&gt;`_Related Projects================* VMware vSphere Automation SDK for Python: https://github.com/vmware/vsphere-automation-sdk-python* Samples Project: https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi-community-samplesHave fun!</longdescription>
