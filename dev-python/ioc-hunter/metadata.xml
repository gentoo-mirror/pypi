	<longdescription># ioc-hunterIOC Hunter finds indicators of compromise (IOC). The parse_iocs function can extract IOCs from text.  The type_ioc function can determine the IOC type of a string that you pass in.The IOCs that are recognized are:- ssdeep- sha256- sha1- md5- email- ipv4_public- ipv4_private- ipv6_public- ipv6_private- filename- domain- url## Parse IOCsThe parse_iocs function parses IOCs in the list above from text. There is an optionto defang the IOCs that are passed back as well as an option to provide a whitelist regex.This will also return IOCs labeled as ``unknown`` when text is found to be suspicious, but doesn'tmatch any of the IOC types.    from ioc_hunter import parse_iocs    text = &quot;Your text goes here&quot;    whitelist = r&quot;.*internaldomain\.com.*&quot;    iocs = parse_iocs(text, defang=False, whitelist_regex=whitlist)```parse_iocsParams:    text – A string to parse.    defang – If True, defang any IOCs we can (see DEFANGABLE). If False, return IOCs in their fanged state.    whitelist_regex – Any IOC matching this regex will be ignored    iocs_to_parse – A list of IOC types to look for (see IOC_TYPES_SEARCH_ORDER for options)    whitelist_domains – A list or CSV of domains to exclude from results. Excludes domains and URLs that match    whitelist_ip_cidr_ranges – A list or CSV of CIDR ranges to exclude from results. Excludes IPs and URLs that matchReturns:    A dictionary with the ioc type as the key and a list of iocs for each value.```## Type IOCThe type_ioc function takes in text and determines if that text matches any of the IOC types.If it does not match any, it will return ``unkown``.    from ioc_hunter import type_ioc        suspected_ioc = &quot;mydomain.com&quot;    ioc_type = type_ioc(suspected_ioc)```type_iocParams:    ioc – The IOC to classify.    types_to_find – A list of types you want to look for.Returns:    The type of the IOC as a string, (see IOC_TYPES_SEARCH_ORDER for options)```</longdescription>
