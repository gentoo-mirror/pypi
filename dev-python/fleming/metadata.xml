	<longdescription>This package contains Fleming, which contains a set of routines for doing datetimemanipulation. Named after Sandford Fleming, the father of worldwide standard timezones,this package is meant to aid datetime manipulations with regards to timezones.Fleming addresses some of the common difficulties with timezones and datetime objects,such as performing arithmetic and datetime truncation across a Daylight Savings Timeborder. It also provides utilities for generating date ranges and getting unix timeswith respect to timezones.A brief description of each function in Fleming is below.
