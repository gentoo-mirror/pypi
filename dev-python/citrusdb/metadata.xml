	<longdescription># üçã citrus.### open-source (distributed) vector database## Installation```bashpip install citrusdb```## Getting started#### 1. Create index```pyimport citrusdb# Initialize clientcitrus = citrusdb.Client()# Create indexcitrus.create_index(  name=&quot;example&quot;,  max_elements=1000,            # increases dynamically as you insert more vectors)```#### 2. Insert elements```pyids = [1, 2, 3]documents = [  &quot;Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life&quot;,  &quot;I'd rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right.&quot;,  &quot;Running a start-up is like chewing glass and staring into the abyss.&quot;]citrus.add(index=&quot;example&quot;, ids=ids, documents=documents)```You can directly pass vector embeddings as well. If you're passing a list of strings like we have done here, ensure you have your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment. By default we use OpenAI to to generate the embeddings. Please reach out if you're looking for support from a different provider!#### 3. Search```pyresults = citrus.query(    index=&quot;example&quot;,    documents=[&quot;What is it like to launch a startup&quot;],    k=1,    include=[&quot;document&quot;, &quot;metadata&quot;])print(results)```You can specify if you want the associated text document and metadata to be returned.By default, only the IDs are returned.Go launch a repl on [Replit](https://replit.com) and see what result you get after running the query! `result` will contain the `ids` of the top `k` search hits.## Example[chat w/ replit ai podcast](https://replit.searchcitrus.com)[pokedex search](https://replit.com/@debabratajr/pokedex-search)## Facing issues?Feel free to open issues on this repository! Discord server coming soon!*PS: citrus isn't fully distributed just yet. We're getting there though ;)*</longdescription>
