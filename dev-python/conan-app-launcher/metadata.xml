It can be used on Windows and Linux x64 platforms.#### Application Link Grid# &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goszpeti/conan_app_launcher/master/doc/screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;512&quot;&gt;#### Local Package Manager# &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goszpeti/conan_app_launcher/master/doc/screenshot_pkg_explorer.png&quot; width=&quot;512&quot;&gt;#### Conan Search# &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goszpeti/conan_app_launcher/master/doc/screenshot_conan_search.png&quot; width=&quot;512&quot;&gt;#### Conan Config# &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goszpeti/conan_app_launcher/master/doc/screenshot_conan_conf.png&quot; width=&quot;512&quot;&gt;**Main Features**- compatible with a wide range of conan versions (from 1.24 onwards)- integrated console for information an packages and config file- installable with pipQuicklaunch- configurable layout (tabs and applications) in the GUI- list and grid view- can also open files with their associated default program- installs all referenced packages automatically- automatic conan settings resolution for your platform- uses the default icons of files or can be configured to use custom ones- quick controls to switch between versions and channelsLocal Package Explorer- view for browsing through installed packages- understand package settings at a glance from a shortened representation, e.g. Linux_x64_ggc7- supports copy/paste on file, open in file explorer, copy reference, etc. functions which are often needed in daily Conan workflowConan Search- search for references in selected remotes- show all existing packages for a reference and their infos- install package directly via right-click menuConan Config- view and edit your profiles- view and edit your remotes - with multilogin to the same arifactory server for multiple remotes- see the most important paths and config at one glance## How to install?### Prerequisites on LinuxCurrently testing and compatibility is only endured for Debian based distros, specifically Ubuntu 20.04.1. Qt for Python must be installed with the native package manager, like:    sudo apt install python3-pyqt52. An x-terminal emulator must be available for &quot;Open Files in cmd&quot; and console based programs for the App Grid. Type &quot;x-terminal-emulator&quot; to get a list of available terminals.3. To open files with its associated program xdg-open is used:    sudo apt install xdg-utils### With pip from PyPi`pip install conan-app-launcher`### From sourceAfter checkout use the command:`pip install .`## RunningExecute `conan-app-launcher`, if the Python &quot;scripts&quot; folder is on your system path, or look it up manually in the site-packages folder. You can also assign its icon to it from the site packages folder in conan_app_launcher/assets/icons/icon.ico.### Main dependencies* PyQt5 &gt;= 5.13.0 * conan &gt;= 1.24.0## ToolchainThis project uses Python with Qt as a frontend using the PyQt integration.An IDE configuration is available for VsCode.See https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=goszpeti_conan_app_launcher for Static Code Analysis.## Licenses of used libraries and code#### Resources* Using icons by https://icons8.com under [Universal Multimedia LicensingAgreement for Icons8](https://icons8.com/vue-static/landings/pricing/icons8-license.pdf)* Using Conan Package Manager Icon by Conan.io developers under [MIT License](&lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php&gt;), via Wikimedia Commons##### PyPi runtime dependencies* PyQt5 by Riverbank Computing Limited, [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)* Conan by JFrog LTD under [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)* jsonschema by Julian Berman under [MIT License](&lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php&gt;)* Using a modified version of Toggle Widget from QtWidgets (https://github.com/pythonguis/python-qtwidgets) under [MIT License](&lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php&gt;)##### PyPi backports for older Python versions* importlib-metadata by Jason R.
