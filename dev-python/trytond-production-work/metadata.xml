They can be organized in a tree structure and each center can belinked to a category. A cost can be defined on the work center with twomethods: ``Per Cycle`` or ``Per Hour``.Work****Works define for a production which operation to do at which work center.They also contains the number of cycles consumed to perform the operation.The work can be in one of these states:* Request  The linked production is still waiting.* Draft  The production has started but no cycle was already consumed.* Waiting  There are some draft cycles planned.* Running  There is at least one running cycle.* Finished  All the cycles are done (or cancelled).* Done  The production is done.The works are created on the waiting production using the linked routing. Foreach step of the routing, a work is created with the operation. The work centeris set if the operation has a work center category, by choosing a children workcenter of this category. Or if the operation has no category, it is theproduction work center that is used.Cycle*****Cycles are used to count the consumption and the duration of the work.
