You can use this tool to get the new URLs for the repos after migrationTo run this, you will need the list of old repo URLS. This can be exported from [service now](https://niketech.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fu_cd_template_mapping_list.do%3Fsysparm_view%3D%26sysparm_first_row%3D1%26sysparm_query%3Du_active%253Dtrue%255Eu_cd_template%253Dtrue%255Eu_template%253Df04e470a13952bc0ea05b3b12244b063%26sysparm_clear_stack%3Dtrue)Create a text [file](old_urls.txt) with repo URLs. Run the tool selecting the right options```shell script? What do you want to do?  Find new git URL for CI/CD changes (SNOW)? Source github organization  nike-platform-fulfillment? File path for the list of Old URLs  old_urls.txt? Github Token  ****************************************Getting new url for orderstatusGetting new url for nikeidboxlabelGetting new url for goodsissueGetting new url for fgwschedulersCompleted process. The new git Urls can be found at new_references.csv```### What this tool will not do- update QMA config in service now- Update ```master``` references to ```main``` in Code like Jenkinsfile, etc- If you use build flows based on the branch, you have to update them accordingly- Doesn't organize bmx jobs into folders- It can't skip bmx jobsTODO- [x] Add branch protection rules and status checks- [ ] Update Scan@Source metadata</longdescription>
