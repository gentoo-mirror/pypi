	<longdescription># AbstractThe `sc2xmlreader` allows to query the XML data interface of the solvis remote extension of a Solvis Heating system with a solvis control 2 board. The XML Interface provides a read-only access. Controlling the heating system is not possible.SC2XMLReader returns the data and states of the Solvis Heating device.The xml-file is public and can be retrieved via http://&lt;your-device-ip&gt;/sc2_val.xmlWhen querying this interface remote will return something like: ```&lt;xml&gt;  &lt;data&gt;    AA5555AA056B0C31350600120076028A013A018[...]0000000000  &lt;/data&gt;&lt;/xml&gt;```the returned payload data has a length of 439 Bytes in an coded format. At this point, many thanks to all the other persons that have decoded this format in the past and shared their insights.## InterfaceTo verify your hostname and user credentials and get the correct url: ```[...]    from sc2xmlreader.sc2xmlreader_validator import SC2XMLReaderValidator    [...]    try:        my_sc2_credential_validator = SC2XMLReaderValidate(&quot;hostname&quot;, &quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)    except ConnectionError as err:        # my be the hostname / ip is not correct    except AuthenticationError as err:        # my be the hostname / ip is not correct    correct_url = my_sc2_credential_validator.url```To query data from solvis remote: ```    from sc2xmlreader.sc2xmlreader import SC2XMLReader    [...]        try:        my_sc2_reader = SC2XMLReader(correct_url, &quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)        the_solar_power = my_sc2_reader.data[&quot;solar_power&quot;]    except ConnectionError as err:        # may be the hostname / ip is not correct```## Exceptions generated- Alle kinds of exceptions from &quot;requests&quot; package- ConnectionError - hostname wrong or solvis remote does not answer as expected- AuthenticationError - User and/or password incorrect## HintBefore being able to use the integration, you have to own a solvis remote device and have it attached, configured and available in your network. To retrieve the xml interface, a username and password must be provided.   ## Sensor data providedThe following sensors are available in the data:| key | name                         | Unit   | Description   ||-----|------------------------------|--------|:-------------------------------------------|| time| last_update                  |        | Timestamp of latest data update.                || Z4  | runtime_solar_pump           | h      | Total output runtime of the solar pump. || SL  | solar_power                  | W      | Current solar power from the solar panels. || S7  | solar_pressure               | bar    | Current pressure in the solar pipes. || SE  | solar_yield                  | kWh    | Total yield of the solar panels to the heating system || S1  | temperature_buffer_top       | °C     | current temperature in the buffer top || S3  | temperature_buffer_reference | °C     | current reference temperature in the buffer || S4  | temperature_H_buffer_top     | °C     | current temperature in the heating buffer top || S9  | temperature_H_buffer_bottom  | °C     | current temperature in the heating buffer bottom || S2  | temperature_warm_water_station | °C     | current temperature warm water station || S11 | temperature_circulation      | °C     | current temperature warm water circulation || S12 | temperature_heating_circuit_1_flow | °C     | current flow temperature heating circuit 1 || S13 | temperature_heating_circuit_2_flow | °C     | current flow temperature heating circuit 2 || S10 | temperature_outside          | °C     | current temperature out the building || S5  | temperature_solar_flow       | °C     | current flow temperature of solar heating  || S8  | temperature_solar_panel      | °C     | current temperature on the solar panel(s)  || S16 | temperature_solar_panel2     | °C     | current temperature on the solar2 panel(s) (if east/ west option) || S16 | temperature_oven             | °C     | current temperature on the solar2 panel(s) (if oven option) || S6  | temperature_solar_return     | °C     | current return temperature of solar heating  || S17 | volume_solar_pump            | l/h    | current volume of fluid stream in solar heating  || S18 | volume_warm_water            | l/min  | current volume of fluid stream in warm water station  |## Binary statesThe following binary states are available in the data:|     | name                         | Description   ||-----|------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|| A12 | burner                       | oil/gas burner started. || A13 | burner_s2                    | oil/gas s2 burner started || A5  | circulation_pump             | warm water circulation pump running || A8  | heating_circuit_1_mixer_open | indicates that the heating circuit 1 increases the flow temperature || A9  | heating_circuit_1_mixer_close| indicates that the heating circuit 1 decreases the flow temperature || A3  | heating_circuit_1_pump       | heating circuit 1 pump is running || A10 | heating_circuit_2_mixer_open | indicates that the heating circuit 2 increases the flow temperature || A11 | heating_circuit_2_mixer_close| indicates that the heating circuit 2 decreases the flow temperature || A4  | heating_circuit_2_pump       | heating circuit 2 pump is running || A6  | heating_circuit_3_pump       | heating circuit 3 pump is running || A14 | recovery                     | recovery is active || A1  | solar_pump                   | solar pump is active || A7  | solar_pump_2                 | second solar pump is active || A2  | warm_water_station_pump      | warm water station pump is started |  ## TrademarksSolvis is a registered trademark of Solvis GmbH, Braunschweig (www.solvis.de)</longdescription>
