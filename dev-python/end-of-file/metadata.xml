	<longdescription># End of fileEnd of file is formatter to ensure text files always end with one newline. Eof is able to resolve every possible situation - missing newline, more then one newline and whitespaces mixed with newlines. Simple configuration is done using parameters, no config file is needed.Configurable options: - include or exclude hidden files (file or folders starting with dot) - blacklisted strings that are found inside traversed paths - whitelisted extensions - whitelisted files that are registered with git - identification of text files (mimetype or bruteforce) - validation only mode for ci pipelinesThe code is short and dead simple so if you have more questions feel free to open an issue or take a look into [src](https://github.com/Keeo/end-of-file/blob/master/src/end_of_file/__init__.py).## InstallationEnd_of_file is python script and thus python3.6 or newer must be present on the system. Eof is just another pip package and can be installed with `pip install end-of-file`.## UsageInstallation adds Eof to your environment so feel free to try```sheof --help```To format project```sheof ./project```If you are using git and are concerned only about files that are registered to git following flag can be used. Git must be installed for this option to work.```sheof ./project --git```To format only specific extensions```sheof ./project --extensions=txt,md,py,rb,cpp```To check in ci/cd if project is formatted correctly, return 0 if yes, 1 if changes are needed. Files are not changed.```sheof ./project --check```In case you have for example build destination in your project and want to skip it you can use --ignore flag. Paths with substring from this option are skipped.```eof --ignore /dist -i egg-info```Circleci job example```yamlcircleci-job:  docker:    - image: circleci/python:3  steps:    - checkout    - run: pip install end-of-file    - run: eof --check```## StrategiesEof needs to have a way to identify files that should be checked for correct newline. There are two options to choose from.### Bruteforce (default)Bruteforce strategy just opens the file and tries to read first line, if that does not work it assumes the file does not contain text and is skipped. This should be the most precise but may take more time.```sheof --strategy='bruteforce'```### MimetypeMimetype strategy checks extensions against lookup table.```sheof --strategy='mimetype'```## TestingCode is fairly well tested, feel free to take a [look](https://github.com/Keeo/end-of-file/tree/master/tests).## LicenseBSD 3-Clause</longdescription>
