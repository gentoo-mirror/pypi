Right now this isprimarily used to upload debug symbols to Sentry if you are not using thefastlane tools.* Downloads can be found under  [Releases](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/releases/)* Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.sentry.io/hosted/learn/cli/)## InstallationIf you are on OS X or Linux, you can use the automated downloader which will fetch the latest release version for you and install it:    curl -sL https://sentry.io/get-cli/ | bashWe do however, encourage you to pin the specific version of the CLI, so your builds are always reproducible.To do that, you can use the exact same method, with an additional version specifier:    curl -sL https://sentry.io/get-cli/ | SENTRY_CLI_VERSION=2.0.4 bashThis will automatically download the correct version of `sentry-cli` for your operating system and install it. If necessary, it will prompt for your admin password for `sudo`. For a different installation location or for systems without `sudo` (like Windows), you can `export INSTALL_DIR=/custom/installation/path` before running this command.If you are using `sentry-cli` on Windows environments, [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist) is required.To verify itâ€™s installed correctly you can bring up the help:    sentry-cli --help### pip_New in 2.14.3_: `sentry-cli` can also be installed using `pip`:```bashpip install sentry-cli```### NodeAdditionally you can also install this binary via npm:    npm install @sentry/cliWhen installing globally, make sure to have set[correct permissions on the global node_modules directory](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).If this is not possible in your environment or still produces an EACCESS error,install as root:    sudo npm install -g @sentry/cli --unsafe-permBy default, this package will download sentry-cli from the CDN managed by [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/).To use a custom CDN, set the npm config property `sentrycli_cdnurl`. The downloader will append`&quot;/&lt;version&gt;/sentry-cli-&lt;dist&gt;&quot;`.```shnpm install @sentry/cli --sentrycli_cdnurl=https://mymirror.local/path```Or add property into your `.npmrc` file (https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/npmrc.html)```rcsentrycli_cdnurl=https://mymirror.local/path```Another option is to use the environment variable `SENTRYCLI_CDNURL`.```shSENTRYCLI_CDNURL=https://mymirror.local/path npm install @sentry/cli```If you're installing the CLI with NPM from behind a proxy, the install script willuse either NPM's configured HTTPS proxy server, or the value from your `HTTPS_PROXY`environment variable.### HomebrewA homebrew recipe is provided in the `getsentry/tools` tap:    brew install getsentry/tools/sentry-cli### DockerAs of version _1.25.0_, there is an official Docker image that comes with`sentry-cli` preinstalled. If you prefer a specific version, specify it as tag.The latest development version is published under the `edge` tag. In production,we recommend you to use the `latest` tag. To use it, run:```shdocker pull getsentry/sentry-clidocker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work getsentry/sentry-cli --help```Starting version _`2.8.0`_, in case you see `&quot;error: config value 'safe.directory' was not found;&quot;` message,you also need to correctly set UID and GID of mounted volumes like so:```shdocker run --rm -u &quot;$(id -u):$(id -g)&quot; -v $(pwd):/work getsentry/sentry-cli --help```This is required due to security issue in older `git` implementations. See [here](https://github.blog/2022-04-12-git-security-vulnerability-announced/) for more details.## CompilingIn case you want to compile this yourself, you need to install at minimum thefollowing dependencies:* Rust stable and Cargo* Make, CMake and a C compilerUse cargo to compile:    $ cargo buildAlso, there is a Dockerfile that builds an Alpine-based Docker image with`sentry-cli` in the PATH. To build and use it, run:```shdocker build -t sentry-cli .docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work sentry-cli --help```</longdescription>
