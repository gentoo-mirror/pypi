You can install it with `pip` orfrom the conda channel `conda-forge`:```bashpip install spacy-loggers``````bashconda install -c conda-forge spacy-loggers```# Loggers## WandbLogger### InstallationThis logger requires `wandb` to be installed and configured:```bashpip install wandbwandb login```### Usage`spacy.WandbLogger.v4` is a logger that sends the results of each training stepto the dashboard of the [Weights &amp; Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) tool. To usethis logger, Weights &amp; Biases should be installed, and you should be logged in.The logger will send the full config file to W&amp;B, as well as various systeminformation such as memory utilization, network traffic, disk IO, GPUstatistics, etc. This will also include information such as your hostname andoperating system, as well as the location of your Python executable.**Note** that by default, the full (interpolated)[training config](https://spacy.io/usage/training#config) is sent over to theW&amp;B dashboard. If you prefer to **exclude certain information** such as pathnames, you can list those fields in &quot;dot notation&quot; in the`remove_config_values` parameter. These fields will then be removed from theconfig before uploading, but will otherwise remain in the config file storedon your local system.### Example config```ini[training.logger]@loggers = &quot;spacy.WandbLogger.v4&quot;project_name = &quot;monitor_spacy_training&quot;remove_config_values = [&quot;paths.train&quot;, &quot;paths.dev&quot;, &quot;corpora.train.path&quot;, &quot;corpora.dev.path&quot;]log_dataset_dir = &quot;corpus&quot;model_log_interval = 1000```| Name                   | Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     || ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- || `project_name`         | `str`           | The name of the project in the Weights &amp; Biases interface.

To usethis logger, MLflow should be installed. At the beginning of each model trainingoperation, the logger will initialize a new MLflow run and set it as the activerun under which metrics and parameters wil be logged. The logger will then logthe entire config file as parameters of the active run. After each training step,the following actions are performed:- The final score is logged under the metric `score`.- Individual component scores are logged under their default names.- Loss values of different components are logged with the `loss_` prefix.- If the final score is higher than the previous best score (for the current run),  the model artifact is additionally uploaded to MLflow. This action is only performed  if the `output_path` argument is provided during the training pipeline initialization phase.By default, the tracking API writes data into files in a local `./mlruns` directory.**Note** that by default, the full (interpolated)[training config](https://spacy.io/usage/training#config) is sent over to MLflow. If you prefer to **exclude certain information** such as pathnames, you can list those fields in &quot;dot notation&quot; in the`remove_config_values` parameter. These fields will then be removed from theconfig before uploading, but will otherwise remain in the config file storedon your local system.### Example config```ini[training.logger]@loggers = &quot;spacy.MLflowLogger.v1&quot;experiment_id = &quot;1&quot;run_name = &quot;with_fast_alignments&quot;nested = Falseremove_config_values = [&quot;paths.train&quot;, &quot;paths.dev&quot;, &quot;corpora.train.path&quot;, &quot;corpora.dev.path&quot;]```| Name                   | Type                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             || ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- || `run_id`               | `Optional[str]`            | Unique ID of an existing MLflow run to which parameters and metrics are logged.
