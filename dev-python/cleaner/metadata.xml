Do youthink this bunch of `ls` and `rm &lt;file&gt;` or `mv &lt;file&gt; &lt;destination&gt;` areneeded ?Cleaner solve exactly this problem, submiting to you each file of the directoryyou want to clean, and reducing the commands to type to `rm` and `mv&lt;destination&gt;`.============Installation============Via pip=======you can just `pip install cleaner`=====Usage=====Use `cleaner &lt;directory&gt;` to clean a messy directoryA shell will be spawn, with the prompt containing a filename. The command youwill type will take effect on this file. Next, another filename will be promptedand each file of the directory will be submited to you this way.Directories end with a '/' character on the prompt.To exit the shell, you can either type `quit`, `Ctrl-D` or `Ctrl-C`.The `info` command prints a line containing some useful informations. Thedefault format is `&lt;mode&gt; | &lt;user&gt;:&lt;group&gt;` wiht `&lt;mode&gt;` being in the sameformat than the first columns of a `ls --long` command in bash.Use `enter` on a directory to list its tree. The directory will be printedagain after the traversal.Use `rm` on a filename to remove an entry. If it's used on a directory, itwill recursively remove all its tree.Use `mv &lt;destination&gt;` to move an entry to `&lt;destination&gt;`. If it's used ona directory, it will recursively move all its tree to `&lt;destination&gt;`.Use `chmod &lt;mode&gt;` to modify permissions of a file or directory. The shell willkeep the same file after this command.Use `chown &lt;user&gt;[:&lt;group&gt;]` to modify ownership of the file or directory. Theshell will keep the same file after this command.If you don't type anything, the shell will go to the next element. This sameeffect will take place if you type `pass`.</longdescription>
