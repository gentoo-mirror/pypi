	<longdescription>JOSE====JOSE is a framework intended to provide a method to securely transferclaims (such as authorization information) between parties. The JOSE frameworkprovides a collection of specifications to serve this purpose. A JSON WebToken (JWT) contains claims that can be used to allow a system to apply accesscontrol to resources it owns.JWTs can be represented as either JSON Web Signature (JWS) or a JSON WebEncryption (JWE) objects. Claims within a JWS can be read as they are simplybase64-encoded (but carry with them a signature for authentication). Claimsin a JWE on the other hand, are encrypted and as such, are entirely opaqueto clients using them as their means of authentication and authorization.This library implements JWS and JWEs along with a subset of theencryption / authentication algorithms recommended by the JOSE framework.Documentation=============http://jose.readthedocs.org/en/latestBuilds======https://travis-ci.org/Demonware/joseCHANGES=======1.0.0 (2015-10-06)------------------- Fixed bug in authentication tag computation (patch contributed by jaimeperez)Important: This is a backwards incompatible change, in that tokens produced in this version will not be decipherable by tokens &lt; 1.0.0. The jwe hash string used was changed to use an empty string rather than &quot;.&quot; to fall in line with https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-5.2.2.10.3.0 (2015-04-10)------------------- Fixed critical JWT vulnerability (patch contributed by yuriikonovaliuk)Important: Only unencrypted tokens are vulnerable. This fix lead to backwardincompatible change to `verify` function signature.0.2.2 (2015-01-07)------------------- RFC compliance fixes (patch contributed by jaimeperez)Important: This change introduces a temporarily injected key (__v) in order todistinguish between legacy and newly issued tokens. This allows for the useof either token as to not break backwards compatibility and (possibly)degrade user experience. This will be removed for v1.0.In order to verify whether or not clients are using a legacy token, theapplication code can verify whether or not the key &quot;__v&quot; is contained in theheaders (this can be done after deserialize_compact). The existence of the keyidentifies a newly created token.0.2.1 (2014-11-24)------------------- Unpinned pycrypto dependency (patch contributed by kuba)- Added CLI exposing &quot;decrypt&quot; command- Added custom exceptions, making client error handling easier0.1 (2014-04-16)----------------- Initial releaseContributors============Demian Brecht (demianbrecht)Nick Murtagh (nmurtagh)Jakub Warmuz (kuba)Jaime PÃ©rez (jaimeperez)Yurii Konovaliuk (yuriikonovaliuk)</longdescription>
