	<longdescription># Hubbub BlubberNotice - this package is only compatible with Hubbub projects.## Getting StartedBlubber is an internal object relational mapper for Hubbub's marketplace database. This is important for consistent object structure across all of Hubbub's projects. It's called 'Blubber' because it's a thick layer on raw data (lol)### PrerequisitesBlubber requires you to define two variables in your environment: 'BLUBBER_DEBUG' and 'DATABASE_URL'.'DATABASE_URL' must be a postgresql URL formatted as 'postgresql://NAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/USER'.'BLUBBER_DEBUG' takes a value of '0' for FALSE or '1' for TRUE. Set these before using, and Blubber will run smoothly:```export BLUBBER_DEBUG=1export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://fakeUser:fakePassword@localhost:5432/fakeDB```### InstallingRun the following command in terminal to install the python package:```pip3 install blubber-orm```## About BLUBBER_DEBUGIn debug mode, Blubber will print all of your queries to terminal. In a future release, these outputs will also catch errors and can be configured to log to a file or email to an admin.### Developer ToolsCreate a play-version of the Hubbub database and fill it with dummy data under /src/blubber_orm/dev!## Built With* [psycopg2](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/) - The DBAPI for running posgresql queries## ContributingBlubber is currently not taking contributions. This policy may change in the future.## LicenseThis project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details</longdescription>
