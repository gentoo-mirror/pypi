	<longdescription># cbinterface`cbinterface` is a command line tool and library for interfacing with one or more Carbon Black environments. As of now, `cbinterface` primarily supports Carbon Black PSC EDR (Threathunter) and Carbon Black Response. However, a lot of functionality should also work with other CBC products, like Enterprise Standard. If you're using Enterprise Standard and something doesn't work, open an issue and I can likely swap out an underlying object and have it working quickly.# Install &amp; Setup## Install Via pip```bashpip install cbinterface```## Install Direct from Github```pip install git+https://github.com/ace-ecosystem/cbinterface2```## Setup &amp; Configure[Look here](https://github.com/ace-ecosystem/cbinterface2/wiki/Configuration) for help setting up and configuring `cbinterface` to work with your Carbon Black enviroments and according to your preferences.# The WikiCheck out the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/ace-ecosystem/cbinterface2/wiki) for detailed documentation and help.That said, if you don't find what you need, have a question about anything, or encounter an issue, open an issue here on Github and I'll help or fix it.
