[Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/) is one of many Farcaster [clients](https://github.com/a16z/awesome-farcaster#clients). As more APIs are created and hosted by different clients, these will be added to the SDK.To use the Warpcast API you need to have a Farcaster account. We will use the mnemonic or private key of the Farcaster custody account (not your main wallet) to connect to the API.First, save your Farcaster mnemonic or private key to a `.env` file. Now you can initialize the client, and automatically connect to the Farcaster API!```pythonimport osfrom farcaster import Warpcastfrom dotenv import load_dotenv # can be installed with `pip install python-dotenv`load_dotenv()client = Warpcast(mnemonic=os.environ.get(&quot;&lt;MNEMONIC_ENV_VAR&gt;&quot;))print(client.get_healthcheck())```## ExamplesGet a cast```pythonresponse = client.get_cast(&quot;0x321712dc8eccc5d2be38e38c1ef0c8916c49949a80ffe20ec5752bb23ea4d86f&quot;)print(response.cast.author.username) # &quot;dwr&quot;```Publish a cast```pythonresponse = client.post_cast(text=&quot;Hello world!&quot;)print(response.cast.hash) # &quot;0x....&quot;```Get a user by username```pythonuser = client.get_user_by_username(&quot;mason&quot;)print(user.username) # &quot;mason&quot;```Get a user's followers using a fid (farcaster ID)```pythonresponse = client.get_followers(fid=50)print(response.users) # [user1, user2, user3]```Stream recent casts```pythonfor cast in client.stream_casts():    if cast:        print(cast.text) # &quot;Hello world!&quot;```Get users who recently joined Farcaster```pythonresponse = client.get_recent_users()print(response.users) # [user1, user2, user3]```Get your own user object```pythonuser = client.get_me()print(user.username) # &quot;you&quot;```Recast a cast```pythonresponse = client.recast(&quot;0x....&quot;)print(response.cast.hash) # &quot;0x....&quot;```and many, many more things.
