	<longdescription># codePost API Python SDK[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/codepost-python/community)[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/codepost-io/codePost-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/codepost-io/codePost-python?branch=master)[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/codepost-io/codepost-python/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/codepost-io/codepost-python?branch=master)This package provides a Python library to conveniently access the codePost APIfrom any application or script written in the Python language.You can learn more about [codePost](https://codepost.io), the best tool for educational code feedback, orcheck out the documentation for powerful, best-in-class [REST API](https://docs.codepost.io/reference) thatthis Python SDK allows you to control.You can also dive in directly with the [codePost API Python SDK cheatsheet](https://docs.codepost.io/docs/python-sdk-cheatsheet).# QuickstartThis section provides a quick overview of how to install the library and getting started, for more completeinformation, you can reference our [First Steps with the codePost API PythonSDK](https://docs.codepost.io/docs/first-steps-with-the-codepost-python-sdk).1. This codePost API Python SDK is available on the Python package manager PyPi, and can be installed from allusual sources, such as with `pip`:    ```shell    sudo pipenv install codepost    ```    You can also install the package just for your account (`pip install --user codepost`) or using a tool such    as `pipenv` which will install the library in a virtual environment (`pipenv install codepost`). 2. Once you've import the `codepost` package, you need to configure it with the API key you've obtained    from [your Settings page](https://codepost.io/settings)     (for other means of setting the API key,    [read here](https://docs.codepost.io/docs/first-steps-with-the-codepost-python-sdk)):    ```python    import codepost    codepost.configure_api_key(&quot;ddafde24389de98434f8df3ee482389de98432afde24482f3428923491344f8df3eef34892349134&quot;)    ```3. You can then directly access the codePost objects:    ```python    course = codepost.course.list_available(name=&quot;CS101&quot;, period=&quot;Spring 2020&quot;)[0]    assignment = course.assignments.by_name(&quot;Hello World&quot;)    submissions = assignment.list_submissions()    for submission in submissions:        print(&quot;{student},{grade}&quot;, student=&quot;+&quot;.join(submission.students), grade=submission.grade)    ```    to print the grades of all submissions of the assignment `&quot;Hello World&quot;` of the course CS101 in Spring 2020.# DevelopmentThe codePost API Python SDK is under active development. At this time, we are welcoming allissues, suggestions and feature requests. Please either [post a GitHub issue on thisrepository](https://github.com/codepost-io/codepost-python/issues), or [join our Gitterchannel](https://gitter.im/codepost-python/community) to ask a question.## Running testsTo start developing, install [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv), then installall dependencies (including development dependencies, with the flag `--dev`) for this project:        git clone https://github.com/codepost-io/codepost-python    cd codepost-python    pipenv install --devRun all tests on all supported versions of Python which you have locally installed:    make testRun all tests for a specific Python version (modify `-e` according to your Python target):    pipenv run tox -e py37Run all tests in a single file for a specific Python version:    pipenv run tox -e py37 -- tests/util/test_misc.py</longdescription>
