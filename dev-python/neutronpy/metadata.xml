	<longdescription>NeutronPy=========NeutronPy is a python library with commonly used tools for neutron scattering measurements, primarily for Triple Axis Spectrometer data, but easily applied to other types of data, including some *reduced* Time of Flight data. Below is a non-exhaustive list of Neutronpy's features:    * Triple Axis Spectrometer resolution function calculation (Translated from ResLib), including        * Resolution ellipses        * Instrument visualization        * Convolution    * Time of Flight Spectrometer resolution function calculation (based on Violini et al `doi:10.1016/j.nima.2013.10.042 &lt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2013.10.042&gt;`_ ), including        * Resolution ellipses    * Structure factor calculation, including        * Structure factors with support for            * Mass Normalization            * Debye-Waller factor            * Unit cell visualization        * Single-ion magnetic form factor calculation    * Least-Squares fitting (custom interface for scipy.optimize.leastsq using lmfit features), including        * Built-in physical models    * Basic data operations        * Binning        * Normalization (time/monitor)        * Calculated peak integrated intensity, position, and width        * Plotting        * Slicing    * Loading from common TAS file types, including        * SPICE        * ICE        * ICP        * MADSee `Roadmap &lt;https://github.com/neutronpy/neutronpy/wiki/Roadmap&gt;`_ for panned future features.David M Fobes started development of NeutronPy while in the `Neutron Scattering Group &lt;http://neutrons.phy.bnl.gov/&gt;`_, part of the Condensed Matter Physics &amp; Materials Science Department (CMPMSD) at `Brookhaven National Laboratory &lt;http://www.bnl.gov/&gt;`_, and has continued within the `MPA-CMMS &lt;http://www.lanl.gov/org/padste/adeps/materials-physics-applications/condensed-matter-magnet-science&gt;`_ and A-1 groups of `Los Alamos National Laboratory &lt;http://www.lanl.gov/&gt;`_. Both are `US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences &lt;http://science.energy.gov/bes/&gt;`_ funded laboratories.NeutronPy is a work-in-progress (see the `Roadmap &lt;https://github.com/neutronpy/neutronpy/wiki/Roadmap&gt;`_ in the wiki for indications of new upcoming features) and as such, still has many bugs, so use at your own risk; see Disclaimer.
