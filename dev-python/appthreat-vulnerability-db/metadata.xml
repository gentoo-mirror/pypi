	<longdescription># IntroductionThis repo is a vulnerability database and package search for sources such as Aqua Security vuln-list, OSV, NVD, GitHub, and NPM. Vulnerability data are downloaded from the sources and stored in a custom file based storage with indexes to allow offline access and quick searches.## Vulnerability Data sources- Linux [vuln-list](https://github.com/appthreat/vuln-list) (Forked from AquaSecurity)- OSV- NVD- GitHub- NPM## Linux distros- AlmaLinux- Debian- Alpine- Amazon Linux- Arch Linux- RHEL/CentOS- Rocky Linux- Ubuntu- OpenSUSE/SLES- Photon## Installation```bashpip install appthreat-vulnerability-db```## UsageThis package is ideal as a library for managing vulnerabilities. This is used by [dep-scan](http://github.com/AppThreat/dep-scan), a free open-source dependency audit tool. However, there is a limited cli capability available with few features to test this tool directly.### Download pre-built databaseUse the [ORAS cli](https://oras.land/cli/) to download a pre-built database containing all application and OS vulnerabilities.```export VDB_HOME=$HOME/vdboras pull ghcr.io/appthreat/vdb:v5 -o $VDB_HOME```### Cache vulnerability dataCache application vulnerabilities```bashvdb --cache```Typical size of this database is over 1.1 GB.Cache application and OS vulnerabilities```bashvdb --cache-os```Note the size of the database with OS vulnerabilities is over 3.1 GB.Cache from just [OSV](https://osv.dev)```bashvdb --cache --only-osv```It is possible to customise the cache behaviour by increasing the historic data period to cache by setting the following environment variables.- NVD_START_YEAR - Default: 2018. Supports upto 2002- GITHUB_PAGE_COUNT - Default: 2. Supports upto 20### Periodic syncTo periodically sync the latest vulnerabilities and update the database cache.```bashvdb --sync```### Basic searchIt is possible to perform simple search using the cli.```bashvdb --search android:8.0vdb --search google:android:8.0vdb --search android:8.0,simplesamlphp:1.14.11```Syntax is package:version,package:version or vendor : package : version (Without space)</longdescription>
