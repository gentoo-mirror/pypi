We contributed as much as possible to the upstream project, but the two projects are now deviating in a way that pushing new changes upstream doesn't make sense anymore.## Python HCL2A parser for [HCL2](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/blob/hcl2/hclsyntax/spec.md) written in Python using[Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark). This parser only supports HCL2 and isn't backwards compatiblewith HCL v1. It can be used to parse any HCL2 config file such as Terraform.## About AmplifyAmplify builds innovative and compelling digital educational products that empower teachers and students across the country. We have a long history as the leading innovator in K-12 education - and have been described as the best tech company in education and the best education company in tech.

You will need to install tox with `pip install tox`.Running `tox` will automatically execute linters as well as the unit tests.You can also run them individually with the `-e` argument.For example, `tox -e py37-unit` will run the unit tests for python 3.7To see all the available options, run `tox -l`.## Responsible DisclosureIf you have any security issue to report, contact project maintainers privately.You can reach us at &lt;mailto:github@amplify.com&gt;## ContributingWe welcome pull requests!
