	<longdescription># [JSONRequest](https://pypi.org/project/jsonrequest/)Lightweight wrapper for requests library that only supports Content-Type: application/json.This only supports `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` http(s) request methods.## How to UseFirst, install the package```bashpip install jsonrequest```Then, you can use the package.```python&gt;&gt;&gt; from jsonrequest import RequestModel, make_request&gt;&gt;&gt; r = make_request(RequestModel(endpoint=&quot;&quot;, method='GET', url='https://google.com'))&gt;&gt;&gt; r&lt;Response [200]&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ```## Note:This data passed also only applies to `application/json` content.Across multiple times over the past many years in my python projects, I found this codeblock repeated whenever I tried to make various http(s) requests using the requests library and thought it'd be much simpler to pass the method as a parameter instead of changing the function. [Here's a medium article](https://medium.com/@justinryanwong/creating-and-releasing-a-new-pypi-package-20218f316aef) of how I created this package as a result. Hope this helps and Happy coding :)- by Justin</longdescription>
