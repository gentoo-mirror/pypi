	<longdescription># ipynbnameWhen run in a Jupyter notebook, simply returns the notebook filename or the full path to the notebook.I created this to help with automating posting blog posts written in Jupyter notebooks directly toGitHub Pages.You would think there was already some built-in way to access the current notebook name, but it took many hoursof searching for a way to do it. As it seems many others did, I tried using Javascript, but the async nature ofJS meant that it was unreliable. Finally I stumbled on this [post](https://forums.fast.ai/t/jupyter-notebook-enhancements-tips-and-tricks/17064/39).I have refactored the code there so a user can get either the name or path, but credit for most of the codegoes to the author of this post, thanks!## ExamplesGet the notebook name:```pythonimport ipynbnamenb_fname = ipynbname.name()```Get the full path to the notebook:```pythonimport ipynbnamenb_path = ipynbname.path()```## LimitationsNote that this only reliably works when running a notebook in a browser. So it does not currently work for things like nbconvert or papermill.For VS Code there is a [workaround](https://github.com/msm1089/ipynbname/issues/17#issuecomment-1293269863).</longdescription>
