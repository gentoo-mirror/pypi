	<longdescription>=============================================================================devpi-server: server for private package indexes and PyPI caching=============================================================================PyPI cache==========You can point ``pip or easy_install`` to the ``root/pypi/+simple/``index, serving as a transparent cache for pypi-hosted packages.User specific indexes=====================Each user (which can represent a person, project or team) can havemultiple indexes and upload packages and docs via standard ``twine`` or``setup.py`` invocations.  Users and indexes can be manipulated through`devpi-client`_ and a RESTful HTTP API.Index inheritance=================Each index can be configured to merge in other indexes so that it servesboth its uploads and all releases from other index(es).  For example, anindex using ``root/pypi`` as a parent is a good place to test out arelease candidate before you push it to PyPI.Good defaults and easy deployment=================================Get started easily and create a permanent devpi-server deploymentincluding pre-configured templates for ``nginx`` and process managers.Separate tool for Packaging/Testing activities==============================================The complementary `devpi-client`_ toolhelps to manage users, indexes, logins and typical setup.py-based upload andinstallation workflows.See https://doc.devpi.net on how to get started and further documentation... _devpi-client: https://pypi.org/project/devpi-client/Support=======If you find a bug, use the `issue tracker at Github`_.For general questions use `GitHub Discussions`_ or the `devpi-dev@python.org mailing list`_.For support contracts and paid help contact ``mail at pyfidelity.com``... _issue tracker at Github: https://github.com/devpi/devpi/issues/.. _devpi-dev@python.org mailing list: https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/devpi-dev.python.org/.. _GitHub Discussions: https://github.com/devpi/devpi/discussions=========Changelog=========.. towncrier release notes start6.9.1 (2023-07-02)==================Bug Fixes---------- Prevent error in find_pre_existing_file in case of incomplete metadata.- Fix #980: Remove long deprecated backward compatibility for old pluggy versions to fix error with pluggy 1.1.0.6.9.0 (2023-05-23)==================Features--------- Support export directory layout for ``--replica-file-search-path`` option.- Fix #931: Add ``mirror_no_project_list`` setting for mirror indexes that have no full project list like google cloud artifacts or if you want to prevent downloading the full list for huge indexes like PyPI.Bug Fixes---------- Keep a reference to async tasks to avoid their removal mid execution.- Support changed default of ``enforce_content_length`` in urllib3 &gt;= 2.- Fix #934: Properly set PATH_INFO when outside URL is used with sub-path.- Fix #945: Adapt FatalError to be usable as an async HTTP response when updating a project on a mirror.- Fix wrong hash metadata introduced in 6.5.0 for toxresults which prevents replication. The metadata can be fixed by an export/import cycle.6.8.0 (2022-12-05)==================Features--------- Fix #929: Cache normalized project names per transaction on mirror index instances.Bug Fixes---------- Fix #914: add locking to list_projects_perstage of mirror indexes to prevent multiple slow concurrent updates of the full project name list.- Catch exceptions in async_httpget analog to httpget.- Add locking to mirror name cache to prevent race condition on updates.6.7.0 (2022-09-28)==================Features--------- Add nginx example to ``devpi-gen-config`` with caching of simple pages for installers like pip.- Automatically check for ``+files`` when using ``--replica-file-search-path``.- Set headers to prevent caching for simple links with stale results.Bug Fixes---------- Fix #840: Correct url scheme in config if nginx is behind another proxy.6.6.1 (2022-09-12)==================Bug Fixes---------- Fix slowdown introduced in 6.6.0 when simple links for mirrors are requested more than once in the same thread.- Removed preservation of original server uuid during import. Imported state is different from the original server. Replicas could not detect the change and get into an inconsistent state.- Prevent cache trashing when updating simple links on mirrors for projects with huge number of releases.- Preserve toxresult filenames during import to keep them being accessible on the same URLs after the fix for #686 in 5.2.0.</longdescription>
