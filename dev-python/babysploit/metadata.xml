Your config file is automaticallygenerated and located at `./babysploit/config/config.cfg`. You can manually change configuration settingsby opening up the file and editing with a text editor or you can use the set command to set a new value fora key. Use the set command like so:```set rhost&gt;&gt; Enter Value For rhost: 10&gt;&gt; Config Key Saved!```If before running this command the rhost key had a value of 80, the rhost key after running this command has avalue of 10. You can also add configuration variables to the config by using the set command with a new key after itlike so:```set newkey&gt;&gt; Enter Value For newkey: hello&gt;&gt; Config Key Saved!```Before running this there was no key named &quot;newkey&quot;. After running this you will have a key named &quot;newkey&quot; in your configuntil you use the `reset` command which resets the saved configuration.#### Running A ToolIn order to run a tool all you have to do is enter the name of the tool into BabySploit.
