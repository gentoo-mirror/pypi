It also doescopy-paste detection (code clone detection/code duplicate detection) and many other forms of staticcode analysis.A list of supported languages:-  C/C++ (works with C++14)-  Java-  C# (C Sharp)-  JavaScript (With ES6 and JSX)-  TypeScript-  Objective-C-  Swift-  Python-  Ruby-  TTCN-3-  PHP-  Scala-  GDScript-  Golang-  Lua-  Rust-  Fortran-  KotlinBy default lizard will search for any source code that it knows and mixall the results together. This might not be what you want. You can usethe &quot;-l&quot; option to select language(s).It counts-  the nloc (lines of code without comments),-  CCN (cyclomatic complexity number),-  token count of functions.-  parameter count of functions.You can set limitation for CCN (-C), the number of parameters (-a).Functions that exceed these limitations will generate warnings. The exitcode of lizard will be none-Zero if there are warnings.This tool actually calculates how complex the code 'looks' rather thanhow complex the code really 'is'. People will need this tool because it'soften very hard to get all the included folders and files right whenthey are complicated. But we don't really need that kind of accuracy forcyclomatic complexity.It requires python2.7 or above (early versions are not verified).Installation------------lizard.py can be used as a stand alone Python script, mostfunctionalities are there. You can always use it without anyinstallation. To acquire all the functionalities of lizard, you willneed a proper install.::   python lizard.pyIf you want a proper install:::   [sudo] pip install lizardOr if you've got the source:::   [sudo] python setup.py install --install-dir=/path/to/installation/directory/Usage-----::   lizard [options] [PATH or FILE] [PATH] ...Run for the code under current folder (recursively):::   lizardExclude anything in the tests folder:::    lizard mySource/ -x&quot;./tests/*&quot;Options~~~~~~~::  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  --version             show program's version number and exit  -l LANGUAGES, --languages LANGUAGES                        List the programming languages you want to analyze. if left empty, it'll                        search for all languages it knows. `lizard -l cpp -l java`searches for                        C++ and Java code. The available languages are: cpp, java, csharp,                        javascript, python, objectivec, ttcn, ruby, php, swift, scala, GDScript,                        go, lua, rust, typescript  -V, --verbose         Output in verbose mode (long function name)  -C CCN, --CCN CCN     Threshold for cyclomatic complexity number warning. The default value is                        15. Functions with CCN bigger than it will generate warning  -f INPUT_FILE, --input_file INPUT_FILE                        get a list of filenames from the given file  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output_file OUTPUT_FILE                        Output file. The output format is inferred from the file extension (e.g.                        .html), unless it is explicitly specified (e.g. using --xml).  -L LENGTH, --length LENGTH                        Threshold for maximum function length warning. The default value is 1000.                        Functions length bigger than it will generate warning  -a ARGUMENTS, --arguments ARGUMENTS                        Limit for number of parameters  -w, --warnings_only   Show warnings only, using clang/gcc's warning format for printing                        warnings. http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#cmdoption-                        fdiagnostics-format  --warning-msvs        Show warnings only, using Visual Studio's warning format for printing                        warnings. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yxkt8b26.aspx  -i NUMBER, --ignore_warnings NUMBER                        If the number of warnings is equal or less than the number, the tool will                        exit normally; otherwise, it will generate error. If the number is                        negative, the tool exits normally regardless of the number of warnings.                        Useful in makefile for legacy code.  -x EXCLUDE, --exclude EXCLUDE                        Exclude files that match the pattern. * matches everything, ? matches any                        single character, &quot;./folder/*&quot; exclude everything in the folder                        recursively. Multiple patterns can be specified. Don't forget to add &quot;&quot;                        around the pattern.  -t WORKING_THREADS, --working_threads WORKING_THREADS                        number of working threads. The default value is 1. Using a bigger number                        can fully utilize the CPU and often faster.  -X, --xml             Generate XML in cppncss style instead of the tabular output. Useful to                        generate report in Jenkins server  --csv                 Generate CSV output as a transform of the default output  -H, --html            Output HTML report  -m, --modified        Calculate modified cyclomatic complexity number , which count a                        switch/case with multiple cases as one CCN.  -E EXTENSIONS, --extension EXTENSIONS                        User the extensions. The available extensions are: -Ecpre: it will ignore                        code in the #else branch. -Ewordcount: count word frequencies and                        generate tag cloud. -Eoutside: include the global code as one function.                        -EIgnoreAssert: to ignore all code in assert. -ENS: count nested control                        structures.  -s SORTING, --sort SORTING                        Sort the warning with field. The field can be nloc,                        cyclomatic_complexity, token_count, parameter_count, etc. Or an customized field.  -T THRESHOLDS, --Threshold THRESHOLDS                        Set the limit for a field. The field can be nloc, cyclomatic_complexity,                        token_count, parameter_count, etc. Or an customized file. Lizard will                        report warning if a function exceed the limit  -W WHITELIST, --whitelist WHITELIST                        The path and file name to the whitelist file. It's './whitelizard.txt' by                        default.

Any function thathas NLOC greater than 10 will generate a warning.Generated code-----------------------------Lizard has a simple solution with generated code. Any code in a source file that is followinga comment containing &quot;GENERATED CODE&quot; will be ignored completely. The ignored code will notgenerate any data, except the file counting.Code Duplicate Detector-----------------------------::   lizard -Eduplicate &lt;path to your code&gt;Generate A Tag Cloud For Your Code----------------------------------You can generate a &quot;Tag cloud&quot; of your code by the following command. It counts the identifiers in your code (ignoring the comments).::   lizard -EWordCount &lt;path to your code&gt;Using lizard as Python module-----------------------------You can also use lizard as a Python module in your code:.. code:: python    &gt;&gt;&gt; import lizard    &gt;&gt;&gt; i = lizard.analyze_file(&quot;../cpputest/tests/AllTests.cpp&quot;)    &gt;&gt;&gt; print i.__dict__    {'nloc': 9, 'function_list': [&lt;lizard.FunctionInfo object at 0x10bf7af10&gt;], 'filename': '../cpputest/tests/AllTests.cpp'}    &gt;&gt;&gt; print i.function_list[0].__dict__    {'cyclomatic_complexity': 1, 'token_count': 22, 'name': 'main', 'parameter_count': 2, 'nloc': 3, 'long_name': 'main( int ac , const char ** av )', 'start_line': 30}You can also use source code string instead of file. But you need toprovide a file name (to identify the language)... code:: python    &gt;&gt;&gt; i = lizard.analyze_file.analyze_source_code(&quot;AllTests.cpp&quot;, &quot;int foo(){}&quot;)Whitelist---------If for some reason you would like to ignore the warnings, you can usethe whitelist. Add 'whitelizard.txt' to the current folder (or use -W to point to the whitelist file), then thefunctions defined in the file will be ignored. Please notice that if you assign the file pathname, it needs tobe exactly the same relative path as Lizard to find the file. An easy way to get the file pathname is to copy it fromthe Lizard warning output.This is an example whitelist:::   #whitelizard.txt   #The file name can only be whitelizard.txt and put it in the current folder.   #You may have commented lines begin with #.   function_name1, function_name2 # list function names in multiple lines or split with comma.   file/path/name:function1, function2  # you can also specify the filenameOptions in Comments-------------------You can use options in the comments of the source code to change thebehavior of lizard. By putting &quot;#lizard forgives&quot; inside a function orbefore a function it will suppress the warning for that function.::   int foo() {       // #lizard forgives the complexity       ...   }Limitations-----------Lizard requires syntactically correct code.Upon processing input with incorrect or unknown syntax:- Lizard guarantees to terminate eventually (i.e., no forever loops, hangs)  without hard failures (e.g., exit, crash, exceptions).- There is a chance of a combination of the following soft failures:    - omission    - misinterpretation    - improper analysis / tally    - success (the code under consideration is not relevant, e.g., global macros in C)This approach makes the Lizard implementationsimpler and more focused with partial parsers for various languages.Developers of Lizard attempt to minimize the possibility of soft failures.Hard failures are bugs in Lizard code,while soft failures are trade-offs or potential bugs.In addition to asserting the correct code,Lizard may choose not to deal with some advanced or complicated language features:- C/C++ digraphs and trigraphs are not recognized.- C/C++ preprocessing or macro expansion is not performed.  For example, using macro instead of parentheses (or partial statements in macros)  can confuse Lizard's bracket stacks.- Some C++ complicated templates may cause confusion with matching angle brackets  and processing less-than ``&lt;`` or more-than ``&gt;`` operators  inside of template arguments.Literatures Referring to Lizard-------------------------------Lizard is often used in software related researches. If you used it to support your work, you may contact the lizard author to add your work in the following list.- Software Quality in the ATLAS experiment at CERN, which refers to Lizard as one of the tools, has been published in the Journal of Physics: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/898/7/072011    - S Martin-Haugh et al 2017 J.
