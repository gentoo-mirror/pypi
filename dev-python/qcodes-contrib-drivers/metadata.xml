	<longdescription>######################QCoDeS contrib drivers######################This repository contains QCoDeS instrument drivers developed by members of the QCoDeS community.These drivers are not supported by the QCoDeS developers but instead supported on a best effort basisby the developers of the individual drivers.Default branch is now main##########################The default branch in qcodes_contrib_drivers has been remamed to main.If you are working with a local clone of qcodes_contrib_drivers you should update it as follows.* Run ``git fetch origin`` and ``git checkout main``* Run ``git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main`` to update your HEAD reference.Getting started###############Prerequisites*************The drivers in this repository work with and heavily depend on QCoDeS. Start by installing `QCoDeS &lt;https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes&gt;`_ .Installation************Install the contrib drivers with ``pip``.. code-block::  pip install qcodes_contrib_driversDrivers documentation*********************The documentations of the drivers in this repository can be read `here &lt;https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes_contrib_drivers&gt;`_.Contributing############This repository is open for contribution of new drivers, as well as improvements to existing drivers. Each driver shouldcontain an implementation of the driver and a Jupyter notebook showing how thedriver should be used. In addition we strongly encourage writing tests for the drivers.An introduction for writing tests with PyVISA-sim can be found in the QCoDeS documentation linkedbelow.Drivers are expected to be added to ``qcodes_contrib_drivers/drivers/MakerOfInstrument/`` folderwhile examples should be added to the ``docs/examples`` folder and tests placed in the``qcodes_contrib_drivers/tests/MakerOfInstrument`` folder. Please follow naming conventions forconsistency.For general information about writing drivers and how to write tests refer to the `QCoDeS documentation &lt;http://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/&gt;`_.Especially the examples `here &lt;https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/examples/index.html#writing-drivers&gt;`__are useful.LICENSE#######QCoDeS-Contrib-drivers is licensed under the MIT license except the ``Tektronix AWG520`` and``Tektronix Keithley 2700`` drivers which are licensed under the GPL 2 or later License.</longdescription>
