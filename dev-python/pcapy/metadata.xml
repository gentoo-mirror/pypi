	<longdescription>This file is an extract from the the online documentation athttps://www.coresecurity.com/corelabs-research/open-source-tools/pcapyWhat is Pcapy?==============Pcapy is a Python extension module that enables software written inPython to access the routines from the pcap packet capture library.From libpcap's documentation: &quot;Libpcap is a system-independentinterface for user-level packet capture. Libpcap provides a portableframework for low-level network monitoring. Applications includenetwork statistics collection, security monitoring, network debugging,etc.&quot;What makes pcapy different from the others?------------------------------------------- * works with Python threads. * works both in UNIX with libpcap and Windows with WinPcap. * provides a simpler Object Oriented API.Getting Pcapy=============Current and past releases are available fromhttps://www.coresecurity.com/corelabs-research/open-source-tools/pcapySetup=====Quick start-----------Grab the latest stable release, unpack it and run 'python setup.pyinstall' from the directory where you placed it. Isn't that easy?Requirements------------ * A Python interpreter. Versions 2.1.3 and newer are known to work. * A C++ compiler. GCC G++ 2.95, as well as Microsoft Visual Studio   6.0, are known to work. * Libpcap 0.7.2 or newer. Windows user are best to check WinPcap 3.0   or newer. * A recent release of Pcapy.Compiling the source and installing-----------------------------------As this extension is written in C++ it needs to be compiled for thehost system before it can be accessed from Python. Fortunately thisprocess has been made easy by the setup.py script. In order to compileand install the source execute the following command from thedirectory where the pcapy's distribution has been unpacked: 'pythonsetup.py install'. This will install the extension into the defaultPython's modules path; note that you might need special permissions towrite there. For more information on what commands and options areavailable from setup.py, run 'python setup.py --help-commands'.This extension has been tested under Linux and Windows systemsand is known to work there, but it ought to work out-of-the-box on anysystem where Python and libpcap are available.Licensing=========This software is provided under under a slightly modified version ofthe Apache Software License.
