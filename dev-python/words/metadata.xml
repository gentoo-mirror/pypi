	<longdescription>words=====Get large collection of words from books.Usage-----1. Make a directory called ``books/``2. Put ``.txt`` files in it. Presumably large ones, i.e. books, which are easily available from Gutenberg_.3. Run ``words.py`` and wait a moment.4. Receive ``dictionary.txt``.Description-----------`words.py` simply reads each of the books and puts each of the words in a book filtering any that obviously aren't words (anything containing numbers or punctuation).NOTE: This method may generate non-words which look like words. It is worth revieiwng the lexicon before any serious use... _Gutenberg: http://www.gutenberg.org/</longdescription>
