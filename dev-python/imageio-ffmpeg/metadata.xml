	<longdescription>FFMPEG wrapper for Python.Note that the platform-specific wheels contain the binary executableof ffmpeg, which makes this package around 60 MiB in size.I guess that's the cost for being able to read/write video files.For Linux users: the above is not the case when installing via yourLinux package manager (if that is possible), because this package wouldsimply depend on ffmpeg in that case.</longdescription>
