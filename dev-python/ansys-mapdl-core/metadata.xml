The latest``ansys-mapdl-core`` package enables a more comprehensive interface withMAPDL and supports:- All the features of the original module (for example, Pythonic commands  and interactive sessions).- Remote connections to MAPDL from anywhere via gRPC.- Direct access to MAPDL arrays, meshes, and geometry as Python  objects.- Low-level access to the MAPDL solver through APDL math in a SciPy-  like interface.Here's a quick demo of PyMAPDL within Visual Studio Code:.. image:: https://github.com/ansys/pymapdl/raw/main/doc/landing_page_demo.gifPyMAPDL works within Jupyter Notebooks, the standard Python console,or in batch mode on Windows, Linux, and even Mac OS.Documentation and issues------------------------Documentation for the latest stable release of PyMAPDL is hosted at `PyMAPDL Documentation&lt;https://mapdl.docs.pyansys.com&gt;`_.In the upper right corner of the documentation's title bar, there is an option for switching fromviewing the documentation for the latest stable release to viewing the documentation for thedevelopment version or previously released versions.You can also `view &lt;https://cheatsheets.docs.pyansys.com/pymapdl_cheat_sheet.png&gt;`_ or`download &lt;https://cheatsheets.docs.pyansys.com/pymapdl_cheat_sheet.pdf&gt;`_ thePyMAPDL cheat sheet. This one-page reference provides syntax rules and commandsfor using PyMAPDL. On the `PyMAPDL Issues &lt;https://github.com/ansys/pymapdl/issues&gt;`_ page,you can create issues to report bugs and request new features. On the `PyMAPDL Discussions&lt;https://github.com/ansys/pymapdl/discussions&gt;`_ page or the `Discussions &lt;https://discuss.ansys.com/&gt;`_page on the Ansys Developer portal, you can post questions, share ideas, and get community feedback. To reach the project support team, email `pyansys.core@ansys.com &lt;pyansys.core@ansys.com&gt;`_.Project transition - legacy support-----------------------------------This project was formerly known as ``pyansys``, and we'd like to thankall the early adopters, contributors, and users who submitted issues,gave feedback, and contributed code through the years.  The``pyansys`` project has been taken up at Ansys and is being leveraged increating new Pythonic, cross-platform, and multi-language service-basedinterfaces for Ansys's products.  Your contributions to``pyansys`` has shaped it into a better solution.The ``pyansys`` project is expanding beyond just MAPDL, and whilethere are many new features and changes to the original Python module,many steps have been taken to ensure compatibility with legacy codewhile supporting new features.  The original python module has beensplit up into the following projects and modules:- `ansys.mapdl.core &lt;https://github.com/ansys/pymapdl&gt;`_- `ansys.mapdl.reader &lt;https://github.com/ansys/pymapdl-reader&gt;`_- `ansys.mapdl.corba &lt;https://github.com/ansys/pymapdl-corba&gt;`_For more information on each project, visit their GitHub pages.Installation------------The ``ansys-mapdl-core`` package currently supports Python 3.8 throughPython 3.11 on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.Install the latest release from `PyPi&lt;https://pypi.org/project/ansys-mapdl-core/&gt;`_ with:.. code:: console   pip install ansys-mapdl-coreAlternatively, install the latest from `PyMAPDL GitHub&lt;https://github.com/ansys/pymapdl/issues&gt;`_ via:.. code:: console   pip install git+https://github.com/ansys/pymapdl.gitFor a local &quot;development&quot; version, install with (requires pip &gt;= 22.0):.. code:: console   git clone https://github.com/ansys/pymapdl.git   cd pymapdl   pip install -e .Offline installation~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~If you lack an internet connection on your install machine, the recommended wayof installing PyMAPDL is downloading the wheelhouse archive from the `ReleasesPage &lt;https://github.com/ansys/pymapdl/releases&gt;`_ for your correspondingmachine architecture.Each wheelhouse archive contains all the python wheels necessary to installPyMAPDL from scratch on Windows and Linux for Python 3.8 and 3.11. You can installthis on an isolated system with a fresh python or on a virtual environment.For example, on Linux Ubuntu with Python 3.10, unzip it and install it with the following:.. code:: console   unzip ansys-mapdl-core-v0.65.0-wheelhouse-ubuntu-latest-3.10.zip wheelhouse   pip install ansys-mapdl-core -f wheelhouse --no-index --upgrade --ignore-installedIf you're on Windows with Python 3.10, unzip manually to a ``wheelhouse`` directory andinstall using the same command as above.Consider installing using a `virtual environment&lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html&gt;`_.Dependencies------------You must have a local licenced copy of Ansys to run MAPDL prior andincluding 2021R1.  If you have the latest version of 2021R1 you donot need MAPDL installed locally and can connect to a remote instance.Getting started---------------Launch MAPDL locally~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~You can launch MAPDL locally directly from Python using ``launch_mapdl``:.. code:: python    from ansys.mapdl.core import launch_mapdl    mapdl = launch_mapdl()This automatically searches for the latest local version of MAPDL,launches it as a background process, and immediately connects to it.You can then start sending python commands to MAPDL.Launching manually or connecting to a remote instance~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~If you want to connect to a session of MAPDL on a remote computer(either locally the LAN or through the internet), first ensure youhave MAPDL started in gRPC server mode.  This example assumes that youare launching an instance locally from Windows, but it can be easilyadapted to run from Linux, or the LAN provided the necessary ports areopen. This example specifies the port with ``-port 50052``, but thisoption can be left out if you plan on using the default port 50052... code:: pwsh-session    start &quot;MAPDL&quot; &quot;%ANSYS211_DIR%\bin\winx64\ANSYS211.exe&quot; -port 50052 -grpcNext, connect to the instance of MAPDL from python with:.. code:: pycon    &gt;&gt;&gt; from ansys.mapdl.core import Mapdl    &gt;&gt;&gt; ip = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;    &gt;&gt;&gt; mapdl = Mapdl(ip=ip, port=50052, start_instance=False)    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(mapdl)A successful connection returns:.. code:: output    Product:             ANSYS Mechanical Enterprise    MAPDL Version:       RELEASE  2020 R2           BUILD 20.2TEST  UPDATE 20200601    ansys.mapdl.core Version: 0.57.0Should you want to connect to this instance of MAPDL from a remotecomputer, you substitute ``ip=`` with the LAN or WAN address of thecomputer you wish to connect to.  Depending on your network settings,you may have to open local ports or enable port redirection across theWAN.Basic usage~~~~~~~~~~~You run MAPDL commands via:.. code:: python    mapdl.run(&quot;/PREP7&quot;)Nearly all the built-in MAPDL commands have an associated pythonicmethod mapped to it.  For example, `/PREP7` is:.. code:: python    mapdl.prep7()There are also non-mapdl commands such as ``mapdl.eplot`` which plotelements using ``vtk`` and ``pyvista`` rather than relying on MAPDL'sgraphics server.  Another is ``mapdl.vget``, which leverages gRPC torapidly exchange binary arrays from MAPDL to Python rather thanrelying on file IO to exchange data.Additionally, there are the ``post_processing``, ``geometry``, and``mesh`` properties, which you can use to perform remote (or local)post processing without result file exchange, display geometryproperties, or view mesh statistics.  Additionally, there's the``parameters`` property which shows the active MAPDL parameters, andyou can use to send or receive arrays between MAPDL and Python.For more information, see the full documentation at `PyMAPDL Documentation&lt;https://mapdl.docs.pyansys.com&gt;`_.Citing this module-------------------If you use ``PyMAPDL`` for research and would like to cite the moduleand source, you can visit `pyansys Zenodo&lt;https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/70696039&gt;`_ and generate thecorrect citation.

This tool extends the functionality of ``MAPDL`` byadding a Python interface to the MAPDL service without changing thecore behavior or license of the original software.  The use of theinteractive APDL control of ``PyMAPDL`` requires a legally licensedlocal copy of Ansys.To get a copy of Ansys, visit `Ansys &lt;https://www.ansys.com/&gt;`_.</longdescription>
