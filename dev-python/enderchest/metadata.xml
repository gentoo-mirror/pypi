With your `enderchest` virtualenvironment activated, run the following command to get an overview of theavailable actions:```bash$ enderchest --help```and use:```bash$ enderchest &lt;verb&gt; --help```(_e.g._ `enderchest place --help`)for further details on running each of those commands.Full documentation, including tutorials, examples and full CLI docs, can befound on [GitHub Pages](https://openbagtwo.github.io/EnderChest/).### Quick-Start GuideTo get started, navigate your terminal to the directory where you'd like tostore your EnderChest. Then run:```bash$ enderchest craft```which will take you through a guided setup.Once your EnderChest is set up (and you've hopefully registered a few instances),run```bash$ enderchest craft shulker_box &lt;name&gt;```for a guided setup of your first shulker box.Run this command again (with  a different name) to create a new shulker box.Now move whatever Minecraft assets (mods, configs, worlds) you want into thatshulker box and run:```bash$ enderchest place```to create symlinks from your registered instance.If you've set up your EnderChest to sync with other remote installations, youcan push your local changes by running:```bash$ enderchest close```To pull in any changes from other installations, run:```bash$ enderchest open```and then```bash$ enderchest place```to update your symlinks.More detailed usage instructions can be found on[GitHub Pages](https://openbagtwo.github.io/EnderChest/dev/usage).## ContributingIf you're interested in helping develop this project, have a look at the[repo backlog](https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/EnderChest/issues) and then readthrough the[contributor's guide](https://openbagtwo.github.io/EnderChest/dev/contrib).## LicenseThis project--the executable, source code and all documentation--are publishedunder the[GNU Public License v3](https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/EnderChest/blob/dev/LICENSE),and any contributions to or derivatives of this project _must_ be licensed undercompatible terms.</longdescription>
