Once you have your API key create an environment variable named `OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY` thatconstains your API key.```shexport OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=your-api-key```Each time the shell is restarted this variable will be cleared. To avoid this it can be added to yourprofile. For example if your shell is zsh the API key can be added to the `~/.zshenv` file. Doing thiswill prevent the need to re-add the key each time the shell is started.To get the weather for a city:```shweather city seattle```Once installed you can also add aliases to your shell to make it quick to get a forecast. For exampleif your shell is zsh you can add something like the following to your `~/.zshrc` file:```shalias we=&quot;weather zip 98109 -i --am-pm&quot;alias wed=&quot;weather zip 98109 -i --am-pm -f daily&quot;alias weh=&quot;weather zip 98109 -i --am-pm -f hourly&quot;```After adding this to the `~/.zshrc` you will need to restart your terminal. After that typing `we`will get the current forecast, `wed` will get the daily forecast and `weh` will get the hourly forecast.## Examples- Current Weather![Current weather](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanders41/weather-command/main/assets/current.png)- Current Weather Temp Only![Current weather temp only](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanders41/weather-command/main/assets/current_temp_only.png)- Daily Weather![Daily weather](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanders41/weather-command/main/assets/daily.png)- Daily Weather Temp Only![Daily weather temp only](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanders41/weather-command/main/assets/daily_temp_only.png)- Hourly Weather![Hourly weather](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanders41/weather-command/main/assets/hourly.png)- Hourly Weather Temp Only![Hourl weather temp only](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanders41/weather-command/main/assets/hourly_temp_only.png)## Settingsweather now has the ability to save settings to default certain flags.
