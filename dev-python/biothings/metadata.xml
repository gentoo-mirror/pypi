It has the particular focus on building data APIs for biomedical-related entities, a.k.a &quot;BioThings&quot; (such as genes, genetic variants, drugs, chemicals, diseases, etc.).Documentation about BioThings SDK can be found at https://docs.biothings.io## Introduction### What's BioThings?We use &quot;**BioThings**&quot; to refer to objects of any biomedical entity-typerepresented in the biological knowledge space, such as genes, geneticvariants, drugs, chemicals, diseases, etc.### BioThings SDKSDK represents &quot;Software Development Kit&quot;. BioThings SDK provides a[Python-based](https://www.python.org/) toolkit to buildhigh-performance data APIs (or web services) from a single data sourceor multiple data sources. It has the particular focus on building dataAPIs for biomedical-related entities, a.k.a &quot;*BioThings*&quot;, though it'snot necessarily limited to the biomedical scope. For any given&quot;*BioThings*&quot; type, BioThings SDK helps developers to aggregateannotations from multiple data sources, and expose them as a clean andhigh-performance web API.The BioThings SDK can be roughly divided into two main components: datahub (or just &quot;hub&quot;) component and web component. The hub componentallows developers to automate the process of monitoring, parsing anduploading your data source to an[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) backend.From here, the web component, built on the high-concurrency [Tornado WebServer](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) , allows you to easilysetup a live high-performance API. The API endpoints exposesimple-to-use yet powerful query features using [Elasticsearch'sfull-text query capabilities and querylanguage](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax).### BioThings APIWe also use &quot;*BioThings API*&quot; (or *BioThings APIs*) to refer to an API(or a collection of APIs) built with BioThings SDK. For example, bothour popular [MyGene.Info](http://mygene.info/) and[MyVariant.Info](http://myvariant.info/) APIs are built and maintainedusing this BioThings SDK.### BioThings Studio*BioThings Studio* is a buildin, pre-configured environment used to build andadminister a BioThings API. At its core is the *Hub*, a backend service responsible for maintaining data up-to-date, producing data releases andupdate API frontends.## Installing BioThings SDKYou can install the latest stable BioThings SDK release with pip from[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi), like:    pip install biothingsYou can install the latest development version of BioThings SDK directlyfrom our github repository like:    pip install git+https://github.com/biothings/biothings.api.git#egg=biothingsAlternatively, you can download the source code, or clone the [BioThingsSDK repository](https://github.com/biothings/biothings.api) and run:    python setup.py install## Get started to build a BioThings APIWe recommend to follow [this tutorial](https://docs.biothings.io/en/latest/tutorial/studio.html) to develop your first BioThings API in our pre-configured **BioThings Studio** development environment.## DocumentationThe latest documentation is available at https://docs.biothings.io.## How to contributePlease check out this [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) document.</longdescription>
