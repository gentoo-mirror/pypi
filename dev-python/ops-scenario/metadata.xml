	<longdescription>Scenario============This is a state transition testing framework for Operator Framework charms.Where the Harness enables you to procedurally mock pieces of the state the charm needs to function, Scenario tests allowyou to declaratively define the state all at once, and use it as a sort of context against which you can fire a singleevent on the charm and execute its logic.This puts scenario tests somewhere in between unit and integration tests.Scenario tests nudge you into thinking of charms as an input-&gt;output function. Input is what we call a `Scene`: theunion of an `Event` (why am I being executed) and a `State` (am I leader? what is my relation data? what is myconfig?...).The output is another context instance: the context after the charm has had a chance to interact with the mocked jujumodel.![state transition model depiction](resources/state-transition-model.png)Scenario-testing a charm, then, means verifying that:- the charm does not raise uncaught exceptions while handling the scene- the output state (or the diff with the input state) is as expected.# Core concepts as a metaphorI like metaphors, so here we go:- There is a theatre stage.- You pick an actor (a Charm) to put on the stage. Not just any actor: an improv one.- You arrange the stage with content that the actor will have to interact with. This consists of selecting:    - An initial situation (State) in which the actor is, e.g. is the actor the main role or an NPC (is_leader), or what other actors are there around it, what is written in those pebble-shaped books on the table?    - Something that has just happened (an Event) and to which the actor has to react (e.g. one of the NPCs leaves the stage (relation-departed), or the content of one of the books changes).- How the actor will react to the event will have an impact on the context: e.g. the actor might knock over a table (a container), or write something down into one of the books.# Core concepts not as a metaphorScenario tests are about running assertions on atomic state transitions treating the charm being tested like a black box.An initial state goes in, an event occurs (say, `'start'`) and a new state comes out.Scenario tests are about validating the transition, that is, consistency-checking the delta between the two states, and verifying the charm author's expectations.Comparing scenario tests with `Harness` tests:- Harness exposes an imperative API: the user is expected to call methods on the Harness driving it to the desired state, then verify its validity by calling charm methods or inspecting the raw data.- Harness instantiates the charm once, then allows you to fire multiple events on the charm, which is breeding ground for subtle bugs. Scenario tests are centered around testing single state transitions, that is, one event at a time. This ensures that the execution environment is as clean as possible (for a unit test).- Harness maintains a model of the juju Model, which is a maintenance burden and adds complexity. Scenario mocks at the level of hook tools and stores all mocking data in a monolithic data structure (the State), which makes it more lightweight and portable.- TODO: Scenario can mock at the level of hook tools. Decoupling charm and context allows us to swap out easily any part of this flow, and even share context data across charms, codebases, teams...# Writing scenario testsA scenario test consists of three broad steps:- Arrange:    - declare the input state    - select an event to fire- Act:    - run the state (i.e. obtain the output state)- Assert:    - verify that the output state is how you expect it to be    - verify that the delta with the input state is what you expect it to beThe most basic scenario is the so-called `null scenario`: one in which all is defaulted and barely any data isavailable. The charm has no config, no relations, no networks, and no leadership.With that, we can write the simplest possible scenario test:```pythonfrom scenario.state import Statefrom ops.charm import CharmBasefrom ops.model import UnknownStatusclass MyCharm(CharmBase):    passdef test_scenario_base():    out = State().trigger(        'start',         MyCharm, meta={&quot;name&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;})    assert out.status.unit == UnknownStatus()```Now let's start making it more complicated.Our charm sets a special state if it has leadership on 'start':```pythonimport pytestfrom scenario.state import Statefrom ops.charm import CharmBasefrom ops.model import ActiveStatusclass MyCharm(CharmBase):    def __init__(self, ...):        self.framework.observe(self.on.start, self._on_start)    def _on_start(self, _):        if self.unit.is_leader():            self.unit.status = ActiveStatus('I rule')        else:            self.unit.status = ActiveStatus('I am ruled')@pytest.mark.parametrize('leader', (True, False))def test_status_leader(leader):    out = State(leader=leader).trigger(        'start',         MyCharm,        meta={&quot;name&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;})    assert out.status.unit == ActiveStatus('I rule' if leader else 'I am ruled')```By defining the right state we can programmatically define what answers will the charm get to all the questions it can ask the juju model: am I leader? What are my relations? What is the remote unit I'm talking to? etc...## StatusesOne of the simplest types of black-box testing available to charmers is to execute the charm and verify that the charm sets the expected unit/application status.We have seen a simple example above including leadership.But what if the charm transitions through a sequence of statuses?```pythonfrom ops.model import MaintenanceStatus, ActiveStatus, WaitingStatus, BlockedStatus# charm code:def _on_event(self, _event):    self.unit.status = MaintenanceStatus('determining who the ruler is...')    try:        if self._call_that_takes_a_few_seconds_and_only_passes_on_leadership:            self.unit.status = ActiveStatus('I rule')        else:            self.unit.status = WaitingStatus('checking this is right...')            self._check_that_takes_some_more_time()            self.unit.status = ActiveStatus('I am ruled')    except:        self.unit.status = BlockedStatus('something went wrong')```You can verify that the charm has followed the expected path by checking the **unit status history** like so:```pythonfrom charm import MyCharmfrom ops.model import MaintenanceStatus, ActiveStatus, WaitingStatus, UnknownStatusfrom scenario import Statedef test_statuses():    out = State(leader=False).trigger(        'start',        MyCharm,        meta={&quot;name&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;})    assert out.status.unit_history == [      UnknownStatus(),      MaintenanceStatus('determining who the ruler is...'),      WaitingStatus('checking this is right...'),      ActiveStatus(&quot;I am ruled&quot;),    ]```Note that the current status is not in the **unit status history**.Also note that, unless you initialize the State with a preexisting status, the first status in the history will always be `unknown`. That is because, so far as scenario is concerned, each event is &quot;the first event this charm has ever seen&quot;.If you want to simulate a situation in which the charm already has seen some event, and is in a status other than Unknown (the default status every charm is born with), you will have to pass the 'initial status' to State.```pythonfrom ops.model import ActiveStatusfrom scenario import State, StatusState(leader=False, status=Status(unit=ActiveStatus('foo')))```## RelationsYou can write scenario tests to verify the shape of relation data:```pythonfrom ops.charm import CharmBasefrom scenario.state import Relation, State# This charm copies over remote app data to local unit dataclass MyCharm(CharmBase):    ...    def _on_event(self, e):        rel = e.relation        assert rel.app.name == 'remote'        assert rel.data[self.unit]['abc'] == 'foo'        rel.data[self.unit]['abc'] = rel.data[e.app]['cde']def test_relation_data():    out = State(relations=[        Relation(            endpoint=&quot;foo&quot;,            interface=&quot;bar&quot;,            remote_app_name=&quot;remote&quot;,            local_unit_data={&quot;abc&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;},            remote_app_data={&quot;cde&quot;: &quot;baz!&quot;},        ),    ]    ).trigger(&quot;start&quot;, MyCharm, meta={&quot;name&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;})    assert out.relations[0].local_unit_data == {&quot;abc&quot;: &quot;baz!&quot;}    # you can do this to check that there are no other differences:    assert out.relations == [        Relation(            endpoint=&quot;foo&quot;,            interface=&quot;bar&quot;,            remote_app_name=&quot;remote&quot;,            local_unit_data={&quot;abc&quot;: &quot;baz!&quot;},            remote_app_data={&quot;cde&quot;: &quot;baz!&quot;},        ),    ]# which is very idiomatic and superbly explicit. Noice.```The only mandatory argument to `Relation` (and other relation types, see below) is `endpoint`. The `interface` will be derived from the charm's `metadata.yaml`. When fully defaulted, a relation is 'empty'. There are no remote units, the remote application is called `'remote'` and only has a single unit `remote/0`, and nobody has written any data to the databags yet.That is typically the state of a relation when the first unit joins it.When you use `Relation`, you are specifying a regular (conventional) relation. But that is not the only type of relation. There are alsopeer relations and subordinate relations. While in the background the data model is the same, the data access rules and the consistency constraints on them are very different. For example, it does not make sense for a peer relation to have a different 'remote app' than its 'local app', because it's the same application.    ### PeerRelationTo declare a peer relation, you should use `scenario.state.PeerRelation`.The core difference with regular relations is that peer relations do not have a &quot;remote app&quot; (it's this app, in fact).So unlike `Relation`, a `PeerRelation` does not have `remote_app_name` or `remote_app_data` arguments. Also, it talks in terms of `peers`:- `Relation.remote_unit_ids` maps to `PeerRelation.peers_ids` - `Relation.remote_units_data` maps to `PeerRelation.peers_data` ```pythonfrom scenario.state import PeerRelationrelation = PeerRelation(    endpoint=&quot;peers&quot;,    peers_data={1: {}, 2: {}, 42: {'foo': 'bar'}},)```be mindful when using `PeerRelation` not to include **&quot;this unit&quot;**'s ID in `peers_data` or `peers_ids`, as that would be flagged by the Consistency Checker:```pythonfrom scenario import State, PeerRelationState(relations=[    PeerRelation(        endpoint=&quot;peers&quot;,        peers_data={1: {}, 2: {}, 42: {'foo': 'bar'}},    )]).trigger(&quot;start&quot;, ..., unit_id=1)  # invalid: this unit's id cannot be the ID of a peer.```### SubordinateRelationTo declare a subordinate relation, you should use `scenario.state.SubordinateRelation`.The core difference with regular relations is that subordinate relations always have exactly one remote unit (there is always exactly one primary unit that this unit can see). So unlike `Relation`, a `SubordinateRelation` does not have a `remote_units_data` argument. Instead, it has a `remote_unit_data` taking a single `Dict[str:str]`, and takes the primary unit ID as a separate argument.Also, it talks in terms of `primary`:- `Relation.remote_unit_ids` becomes `SubordinateRelation.primary_id` (a single ID instead of a list of IDs) - `Relation.remote_units_data` becomes `SubordinateRelation.remote_unit_data` (a single databag instead of a mapping from unit IDs to databags) - `Relation.remote_app_name` maps to `SubordinateRelation.primary_app_name````pythonfrom scenario.state import SubordinateRelationrelation = SubordinateRelation(    endpoint=&quot;peers&quot;,    remote_unit_data={&quot;foo&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;},    primary_app_name=&quot;zookeeper&quot;,    primary_id=42)relation.primary_name  # &quot;zookeeper/42&quot;```## Triggering Relation EventsIf you want to trigger relation events, the easiest way to do so is get a hold of the Relation instance and grab the event from one of its aptly-named properties:```pythonfrom scenario import Relationrelation = Relation(endpoint=&quot;foo&quot;, interface=&quot;bar&quot;)changed_event = relation.changed_eventjoined_event = relation.joined_event# ...```This is in fact syntactic sugar for:```pythonfrom scenario import Relation, Eventrelation = Relation(endpoint=&quot;foo&quot;, interface=&quot;bar&quot;)changed_event = Event('foo-relation-changed', relation=relation)```The reason for this construction is that the event is associated with some relation-specific metadata, that Scenario needs to set up the process that will run `ops.main` with the right environment variables.### Additional event parametersAll relation events have some additional metadata that does not belong in the Relation object, such as, for a relation-joined event, the name of the (remote) unit that is joining the relation. That is what determines what `ops.model.Unit` you get when you get `RelationJoinedEvent().unit` in an event handler.In order to supply this parameter, you will have to **call** the event object and pass as `remote_unit_id` the id of the remote unit that the event is about.The reason that this parameter is not supplied to `Relation` but to relation events, is that the relation already ties 'this app' to some 'remote app' (cfr. the `Relation.remote_app_name` attr), but not to a specific unit. What remote unit this event is about is not a `State` concern but an `Event` one.  The `remote_unit_id` will default to the first ID found in the relation's `remote_unit_ids`, but if the test you are writing is close to that domain, you should probably override it and pass it manually.```pythonfrom scenario import Relation, Eventrelation = Relation(endpoint=&quot;foo&quot;, interface=&quot;bar&quot;)remote_unit_2_is_joining_event = relation.joined_event(remote_unit_id=2)# which is syntactic sugar for:remote_unit_2_is_joining_event = Event('foo-relation-changed', relation=relation, relation_remote_unit_id=2)```## ContainersWhen testing a kubernetes charm, you can mock container interactions.When using the null state (`State()`), there will be no containers. So if the charm were to `self.unit.containers`, it would get back an empty dict.To give the charm access to some containers, you need to pass them to the input state, like so:`State(containers=[...])`An example of a scene including some containers:```pythonfrom scenario.state import Container, Statestate = State(containers=[    Container(name=&quot;foo&quot;, can_connect=True),    Container(name=&quot;bar&quot;, can_connect=False)])```In this case, `self.unit.get_container('foo').can_connect()` would return `True`, while for 'bar' it would give `False`.You can configure a container to have some files in it:```pythonfrom pathlib import Pathfrom scenario.state import Container, State, Mountlocal_file = Path('/path/to/local/real/file.txt')state = State(containers=[    Container(name=&quot;foo&quot;,              can_connect=True,              mounts={'local': Mount('/local/share/config.yaml', local_file)})])```In this case, if the charm were to:```pythondef _on_start(self, _):    foo = self.unit.get_container('foo')    content = foo.pull('/local/share/config.yaml').read()```then `content` would be the contents of our locally-supplied `file.txt`. You can use `tempdir` for nicely wrapping strings and passing them to the charm via the container.`container.push` works similarly, so you can write a test like:```pythonimport tempfilefrom ops.charm import CharmBasefrom scenario.state import State, Container, Mountclass MyCharm(CharmBase):    def __init__(self, *args):        super().__init__(*args)        self.framework.observe(self.on.foo_pebble_ready, self._on_pebble_ready)    def _on_pebble_ready(self, _):        foo = self.unit.get_container('foo')        foo.push('/local/share/config.yaml', &quot;TEST&quot;, make_dirs=True)def test_pebble_push():    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as local_file:        container = Container(name='foo',                              can_connect=True,                              mounts={'local': Mount('/local/share/config.yaml', local_file.name)})        out = State(            containers=[container]        ).trigger(            container.pebble_ready_event,            MyCharm,            meta={&quot;name&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;containers&quot;: {&quot;foo&quot;: {}}},        )        assert local_file.read().decode() == &quot;TEST&quot;````container.pebble_ready_event` is syntactic sugar for: `Event(&quot;foo-pebble-ready&quot;, container=container)`. The reason we need to associate the container with the event is that the Framework uses an envvar to determine which container the pebble-ready event is about (it does not use the event name). Scenario needs that information, similarly, for injecting that envvar into the charm's runtime.`container.exec` is a tad more complicated, but if you get to this low a level of simulation, you probably will have far worse issues to deal with.You need to specify, for each possible command the charm might run on the container, what the result of that would be: its return code, what will be written to stdout/stderr.```pythonfrom ops.charm import CharmBasefrom scenario.state import State, Container, ExecOutputLS_LL = &quot;&quot;&quot;.rw-rw-r--  228 ubuntu ubuntu 18 jan 12:05 -- charmcraft.yaml    .rw-rw-r--  497 ubuntu ubuntu 18 jan 12:05 -- config.yaml        .rw-rw-r--  900 ubuntu ubuntu 18 jan 12:05 -- CONTRIBUTING.md    drwxrwxr-x    - ubuntu ubuntu 18 jan 12:06 -- lib                &quot;&quot;&quot;class MyCharm(CharmBase):    def _on_start(self, _):        foo = self.unit.get_container('foo')        proc = foo.exec(['ls', '-ll'])        stdout, _ = proc.wait_output()        assert stdout == LS_LLdef test_pebble_exec():    container = Container(        name='foo',        exec_mock={            ('ls', '-ll'):  # this is the command we're mocking                ExecOutput(return_code=0,  # this data structure contains all we need to mock the call.                           stdout=LS_LL)        }    )    out = State(        containers=[container]    ).trigger(        container.pebble_ready_event,        MyCharm,        meta={&quot;name&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;containers&quot;: {&quot;foo&quot;: {}}},    )```# Deferred eventsScenario allows you to accurately simulate the Operator Framework's event queue. The event queue is responsible for keeping track of the deferred events.On the input side, you can verify that if the charm triggers with this and that event in its queue (they would be there because they had been deferred in the previous run), then the output state is valid.```pythonfrom scenario import State, deferredclass MyCharm(...):    ...    def _on_update_status(self, e):        e.defer()    def _on_start(self, e):        e.defer()        def test_start_on_deferred_update_status(MyCharm):    &quot;&quot;&quot;Test charm execution if a 'start' is dispatched when in the previous run an update-status had been deferred.&quot;&quot;&quot;    out = State(      deferred=[            deferred('update_status',                      handler=MyCharm._on_update_status)        ]    ).trigger('start', MyCharm)    assert len(out.deferred) == 1    assert out.deferred[0].name == 'start'```You can also generate the 'deferred' data structure (called a DeferredEvent) from the corresponding Event (and the handler):```pythonfrom scenario import Event, Relationclass MyCharm(...):    ...deferred_start = Event('start').deferred(MyCharm._on_start)deferred_install = Event('install').deferred(MyCharm._on_start)```## relation events:```python   foo_relation = Relation('foo') deferred_relation_changed_evt = foo_relation.changed_event.deferred(handler=MyCharm._on_foo_relation_changed)```On the output side, you can verify that an event that you expect to have been deferred during this trigger, has indeed been deferred.```pythonfrom scenario import Stateclass MyCharm(...):    ...    def _on_start(self, e):        e.defer()        def test_defer(MyCharm):    out = State().trigger('start', MyCharm)    assert len(out.deferred) == 1    assert out.deferred[0].name == 'start'```    ## Deferring relation eventsIf you want to test relation event deferrals, some extra care needs to be taken. RelationEvents hold references to the Relation instance they are about. So do they in Scenario. You can use the deferred helper to generate the data structure:```pythonfrom scenario import State, Relation, deferredclass MyCharm(...):    ...    def _on_foo_relation_changed(self, e):        e.defer()        def test_start_on_deferred_update_status(MyCharm):    foo_relation = Relation('foo')     State(      relations=[foo_relation],      deferred=[            deferred('foo_relation_changed',                      handler=MyCharm._on_foo_relation_changed,                     relation=foo_relation)        ]    )```but you can also use a shortcut from the relation event itself, as mentioned above:```pythonfrom scenario import Relationclass MyCharm(...):    ...foo_relation = Relation('foo') foo_relation.changed_event.deferred(handler=MyCharm._on_foo_relation_changed)```### Fine-tuningThe deferred helper Scenario provides will not support out of the box all custom event subclasses, or events emitted by charm libraries or objects other than the main charm class.For general-purpose usage, you will need to instantiate DeferredEvent directly.```pythonfrom scenario import DeferredEventmy_deferred_event = DeferredEvent(   handle_path='MyCharm/MyCharmLib/on/database_ready[1]',   owner='MyCharmLib',  # the object observing the event. Could also be MyCharm.   observer='_on_database_ready')```# StoredStateScenario can simulate StoredState.You can define it on the input side as:```pythonfrom ops.charm import CharmBasefrom ops.framework import StoredState as Ops_StoredState, Frameworkfrom scenario import State, StoredStateclass MyCharmType(CharmBase):    my_stored_state = Ops_StoredState()    def __init__(self, framework: Framework):        super().__init__(framework)        assert self.my_stored_state.foo == 'bar'  # this will pass!state = State(stored_state=[  StoredState(    owner_path=&quot;MyCharmType&quot;,    name=&quot;my_stored_state&quot;,    content={      'foo': 'bar',      'baz': {42: 42},    })])```And the charm's runtime will see `self.stored_State.foo` and `.baz` as expected.Also, you can run assertions on it on the output side the same as any other bit of state.# Emitted eventsIf your charm deals with deferred events, custom events, and charm libs that in turn emit their own custom events, it can be hard to examine the resulting control flow.In these situations it can be useful to verify that, as a result of a given juju event triggering (say, 'start'), a specific chain of deferred and custom events is emitted on the charm. The resulting state, black-box as it is, gives little insight into how exactly it was obtained. `scenario.capture_events` allows you to open a peephole and intercept any events emitted by the framework. Usage: ```pythonfrom ops.charm import StartEvent, UpdateStatusEventfrom scenario import State, DeferredEventfrom scenario import capture_eventswith capture_events() as emitted:    state_out = State(deferred=[DeferredEvent('start', ...)]).trigger('update-status', ...)# deferred events get reemitted firstassert isinstance(emitted[0], StartEvent)# the main juju event gets emitted nextassert isinstance(emitted[1], UpdateStatusEvent)# possibly followed by a tail of all custom events that the main juju event triggered in turn# assert isinstance(emitted[2], MyFooEvent)# ... ```You can filter events by type like so:```pythonfrom ops.charm import StartEvent, RelationEventfrom scenario import capture_eventswith capture_events(StartEvent, RelationEvent) as emitted:    # capture all `start` and `*-relation-*` events.    pass  ```Passing no event types, like: `capture_events()`, is equivalent to `capture_events(EventBase)`.By default, **framework events** (`PreCommit`, `Commit`) are not considered for inclusion in the output list even if they match the instance check. You can toggle that by passing: `capture_events(include_framework=True)`.By default, **deferred events** are included in the listing if they match the instance check. You can toggle that by passing:`capture_events(include_deferred=True)`.# The virtual charm rootBefore executing the charm, Scenario writes the metadata, config, and actions `yaml`s to a temporary directory. The charm will see that tempdir as its 'root'. This allows us to keep things simple when dealing with metadata that can be either inferred from the charm type being passed to `trigger()` or be passed to it as an argument, thereby overridingthe inferred one. This also allows you to test with charms defined on the fly, as in:```pythonfrom ops.charm import CharmBasefrom scenario import Stateclass MyCharmType(CharmBase):    passstate = State().trigger(charm_type=MyCharmType, meta={'name': 'my-charm-name'}, event='start')```A consequence of this fact is that you have no direct control over the tempdir that we arecreating to put the metadata you are passing to trigger (because `ops` expects it to be a file...).That is, unless you pass your own:```pythonfrom ops.charm import CharmBasefrom scenario import Stateimport tempfileclass MyCharmType(CharmBase):  passtd = tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()state = State().trigger(charm_type=MyCharmType, meta={'name': 'my-charm-name'}, event='start',                        charm_root=td.name)```Do this, and you will be able to set up said directory as you like before the charm is run, as well as verify its contents after the charm has run. Do keep in mind that the metadata files will be overwritten by Scenario, and therefore ignored.# Consistency checksA Scenario, that is, the combination of an event, a state, and a charm, is consistent if it's plausible in JujuLand.For example, Juju can't emit a `foo-relation-changed` event on your charm unless your charm has declared a `foo` relationendpoint in its `metadata.yaml`. If that happens, that's a juju bug.Scenario however assumes that Juju is bug-free, therefore, so far as we're concerned, that can't happen, and therefore we help you verify that the scenarios you create are consistent and raise an exception if that isn't so.That happens automatically behind the scenes whenever you trigger an event; `scenario.consistency_checker.check_consistency`is called and verifies that the scenario makes sense.## Caveats:- False positives: not all checks are implemented yet; more will come.- False negatives: it is possible that a scenario you know to be consistent is seen as inconsistent. That is probably a bug in the consistency checker itself, please report it.- Inherent limitations: if you have a custom event whose name conflicts with a builtin one, the consistency constraints of the builtin one will apply. For example: if you decide to name your custom event `bar-pebble-ready`, but you are working on a machine charm or don't have either way a `bar` container in your `metadata.yaml`, Scenario will flag that as inconsistent. ## Bypassing the checkerIf you have a clear false negative, are explicitly testing 'edge', inconsistent situations, or for whatever reason the checker is in your way, you can set the `SCENARIO_SKIP_CONSISTENCY_CHECKS` envvar and skip it altogether. Hopefully you don't need that.# SnapshotScenario comes with a cli tool called `snapshot`. Assuming you've pip-installed `ops-scenario`, you should be able to reach the entry point by typing `scenario snapshot` in a shell.Snapshot's purpose is to gather the State data structure from a real, live charm running in some cloud your local juju client has access to. This is handy in case:- you want to write a test about the state the charm you're developing is currently in- your charm is bork or in some inconsistent state, and you want to write a test to check the charm will handle it correctly the next time around (aka regression testing)- you are new to Scenario and want to quickly get started with a real-life example.Suppose you have a Juju model with a `prometheus-k8s` unit deployed as `prometheus-k8s/0`. If you type `scenario snapshot prometheus-k8s/0`, you will get a printout of the State object. Copy-paste that in some file, import all you need from `scenario`, and you have a working `State` that you can `.trigger()` events from.You can also pass a `--format json | pytest | state (default=state)` flag to obtain- jsonified `State` data structure, for portability- a full-fledged pytest test case (with imports and all), where you only have to fill in the charm type and the event that you wish to trigger. # TODOS:- Recorder</longdescription>
