See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_retry/pull/202.1 (2019-09-30)================- Add ``exception`` and ``response`` attributes to the  ``pyramid_retry.IBeforeRetry`` event.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_retry/pull/192.0 (2019-06-06)================- No longer call ``invoke_exception_view`` if the policy catches an exception.  If on the last attempt or non-retryable then the exception will now bubble  out of the app and into WSGI middleware.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_retry/pull/171.0 (2018-10-18)================- Support Python 3.7.- Update the version we require for Pyramid to a non-prerelease so that pip and  other tools don't accidentally install pre-release software.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_retry/pull/130.5 (2017-06-19)================- Update the policy to to track changes in Pyramid 1.9b1. This is an  incompatible change and requires at least Pyramid 1.9b1.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_retry/pull/110.4 (2017-06-12)================- Add the ``mark_error_retryable`` function in order to easily mark  certain errors as retryable for ``pyramid_retry`` to detect.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_retry/pull/8- Add the ``IBeforeRetry`` event that can be subscribed to be notified  when a retry is about to occur in order to perform cleanup on the  ``environ``. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_retry/pull/90.3 (2017-04-10)================- Support a ``retry.activate_hook`` setting which can return a per-request  number of retries. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_retry/pull/4- Configuration is deferred so that settings may be changed after  ``config.include('pyramid_retry')`` is invoked until the configurator  is committed. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_retry/pull/4- Rename the view predicates to ``last_retry_attempt`` and  ``retryable_error``. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_retry/pull/3- Rename ``pyramid_retry.is_exc_retryable`` to  ``pyramid_retry.is_error_retryable``.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_retry/pull/30.2 (2017-03-02)================- Change the default attempts to 3 instead of 1.- Rename the view predicates to ``is_last_attempt`` and ``is_exc_retryable``.- Drop support for the ``tm.attempts`` setting.- The ``retry.attempts`` setting is always set now in  ``registry.settings['retry.attempts']`` so that apps can inspect it.0.1 (2017-03-01)================- Initial release.</longdescription>
