	<longdescription># remotezip[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gtsystem/python-remotezip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gtsystem/python-remotezip)This module provides a way to access single members of a zip file archive without downloading the full content from a remote web server. For this library to work, the web server hosting the archive needs to support the [range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests) header. ## Installation`pip install remotezip`## Usage### Initialization`RemoteZip(url, ...)`To download the content, this library rely on the `requests` module. The constructor interface matches the function `requests.get` module.* **url**: Url where the zip file is located *(required)*.* **auth**: authentication credentials.* **headers**: headers to pass to the request.* **timeout**: timeout for the request.* **verify**: enable/disable certificate verification or set custom certificates location.* ... Please look at the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#make-a-request) documentation for futher usage details.* **initial\_buffer\_size**: How much data (in bytes) to fetch during the first connection to download the zip file central directory. If your zip file conteins a lot of files, would be a good idea to increase this parameter in order to avoid the need for further remote requests. *Default: 64kb*.* **session**: a custom session object to use for the request.* **support_suffix_range**: You can set this attribute to `False` if the remote server doesn't support suffix range  (negative offset). Notice that this option will use one more HEAD request to fetch the content length.### Class Interface`RemoteZip` is a subclass of the python standard library class `zipfile.ZipFile`, so it supports all its read methods:* `RemoteZip.close()`* `RemoteZip.getinfo(name)`* `RemoteZip.extract(member[, path[, pwd]])`* `RemoteZip.extractall([path[, members[, pwd]]])`* `RemoteZip.infolist()`* `RemoteZip.namelist()`* `RemoteZip.open(name[, mode[, pwd]])`* `RemoteZip.printdir()`* `RemoteZip.read(name[, pwd])`* `RemoteZip.testzip()`* `RemoteZip.filename`* `RemoteZip.debug`* `RemoteZip.comment`Please look at the [zipfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile-objects) documentation for usage details.**NOTE**:* `extractall()` and `testzip()` require to access the full content of the archive. If you need to use such methods, a full download of it would be probably more efficient.* `RemoteZip.open()` now supports seek operations when reading archive members. However as the content is streamed and DEFLATE format doesn't support seek natively, any negative seek operation will result in a new remote request from the beginning of the member content. This is very inefficient, the recommandation is to use `RemoteZip.extract()` and then open and operate on the extracted file.### Examples#### List members in archivePrint all members part of the archive:```pythonfrom remotezip import RemoteZipwith RemoteZip('http://.../myfile.zip') as zip:    for zip_info in zip.infolist():        print(zip_info.filename)```#### Download a memberThe following example will extract the file `somefile.txt` from the archive stored at the url `http://.../myfile.zip`.```pythonfrom remotezip import RemoteZipwith RemoteZip('http://.../myfile.zip') as zip:    zip.extract('somefile.txt')```#### S3 exampleIf you are trying to download a member from a zip archive hosted on S3 you can use the [aws-requests-auth](https://github.com/DavidMuller/aws-requests-auth) library for that as follow: ```pythonfrom aws_requests_auth.boto_utils import BotoAWSRequestsAuthfrom hashlib import sha256auth = BotoAWSRequestsAuth(    aws_host='s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com',    aws_region='eu-west-1',    aws_service='s3')headers = {'x-amz-content-sha256': sha256('').hexdigest()}url = &quot;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/.../file.zip&quot;with RemoteZip(url, auth=auth, headers=headers) as z:     zip.extract('somefile.txt')```## Command line toolA simple command line tool is included in this distribution.```usage: remotezip [-h] [-l] [-d DIR] url [filename [filename ...]]Unzip remote filespositional arguments:  url                Url of the zip archive  filename           File to extractoptional arguments:  -h, --help         show this help message and exit  -l, --list         List files in the archive  -d DIR, --dir DIR  Extract directory, default current directory```#### Example```$ remotezip -l &quot;http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.zip&quot;  Length  DateTime             Name--------  -------------------  ------------------------    2962  2008-07-30 13:58:46  Readme.txt   24740  2008-07-30 12:16:46  TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.dbf     145  2008-03-12 13:11:54  TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.prj 6478464  2008-07-30 12:16:46  TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.shp    2068  2008-07-30 12:16:46  TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.shx    $ remotezip &quot;http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.zip&quot; Readme.txtExtracting Readme.txt...```## How it worksThis module uses the `zipfile.ZipFile` class under the hood to decode the zip file format. The `ZipFile` class is initialized with a file like object that will perform transparently the remote queries.The zip format is composed by the content of each compressed member followed by the central directory.How many requests will this module perform to download a member?* If the full archive content is smaller than **initial\_buffer\_size**, only one request will be needed.* Normally two requests are needed, one to download the central directory and one to download the archive member.* If the central directory is bigger than **initial\_buffer\_size**, a third request will be required.* If negative seek operations are used in `ZipExtFile`, each of them will result in a new request.## Alternative modulesThere is a similar module available for python [pyremotezip](https://github.com/fcvarela/pyremotezip).</longdescription>
