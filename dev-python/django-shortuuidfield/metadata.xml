	<longdescription>django-shortuuidfield----------------Provides a ShortUUIDField for your Django models which uses the base-57 &quot;Short UUID&quot; package at https://github.com/stochastic-technologies/shortuuid/ .Originally, a fork from David Cramer's excellent django-uuidfield, but not much is left of that besides a bit of structure.Installation============Install it with pip (or easy_install)::pip install django-shortuuidfieldUsage=====First you'll need to attach a ShortUUIDField to your class. This acts as a char(22) to maintain compatibility with SQL versions::from shortuuidfield import ShortUUIDFieldclass MyModel(models.Model):    uuid = ShortUUIDField()Enjoy!Notes=====* ShortUUIDField is a subclass of django.db.models.CharField* You can pass usual Django CharField parameters on init, although some of them are added/overwritten:     + max_length=22 (since we are using base-57 format which is fixed at 22 characters)    + blank=True, editable=False (set auto=False to remove these fields enforcement)* Uses shortuuid.uuid() that generates uuid4 random values</longdescription>
