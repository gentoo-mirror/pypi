	<longdescription># SamariumSamarium is a dynamic interpreted language transpiled to Python.Samarium, in its most basic form, doesn't use any digits or letters.Here's a `Hello, World!` program written in Samarium:```kt&quot;Hello, World!&quot;!;```Documentation on how to program in Samarium can be found [here](https://samarium-lang.github.io/Samarium/).# Installation## [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)```shpip install samarium```## [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/)```shgit clone https://aur.archlinux.org/samarium.git &amp;&amp; cd samarium &amp;&amp; makepkg -sirc```or use your favorite [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers).## Using SamariumYou can run Samarium programs with `samarium program.sm`.`samarium-debug` may be used instead, which will first print out the intermediary Python code that the Samarium program is transpiled into, before executing it.Short | Long | Description:---: | :---: | :---`-c &lt;cmd&gt;` | `--command &lt;cmd&gt;` | Can be used to execute Samarium code from the string `cmd`,&lt;br&gt;directly in the terminal. `cmd` can be one or more statements&lt;br&gt;separated by semicolons as usual. Note that the last statement&lt;br&gt; of `cmd` will be printed if it does not end in a semicolon.`-h` | `--help` | Shows the help message`-v` | `--version` | Prints Samarium versionThere is also a VSCode syntax highlighting extension for Samarium, which can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Samarium.samarium-language). The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/samarium-lang/vscode-samarium).# CreditsSamarium was inspired by several languages, including [brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and [Python](https://www.python.org/).Special thanks to:- [tetraxile](https://github.com/tetraxile) for helping with design choices and writing the docs- [MithicSpirit](https://github.com/MithicSpirit) for making an AUR package for Samarium- [DarviL82](https://github.com/DarviL82) for fixing some issues- [Endercheif](https://github.com/Endercheif) for making the documentation look fancy, helping with design choices, and adding partial Python InteroperabilityIf you have any questions, or would like to get in touch, join my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/C8QE5tVQEq)!</longdescription>
