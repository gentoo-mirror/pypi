	<longdescription>Pure Python implementation of rpmvercmp.The RPM Package Manager (http://rpm.org) has a version comparision algorithm,implemented in its C library, which performs the comparison in a certain way.In certain circumstances, where the C library is not installable (for example,on non-rpm based systems), or does not support the desired version of thepython interpreter, the pure-python implementation may be useful.Source Code===========https://github.com/sassoftware/python-rpm-vercmpInstallation============        $ pip install rpm_vercmpUsage=====        import rpm_vercmp        assert rpm_vercmp.vercmp(&quot;1.0&quot;, &quot;1.0&quot;) == 0        assert rpm_vercmp.vercmp(&quot;1.0&quot;, &quot;1.1&quot;) == -1Testing=======The testsuite uses rpm's test file in m4 format.The file cat be fetched from:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/master/tests/rpmvercmp.at</longdescription>
