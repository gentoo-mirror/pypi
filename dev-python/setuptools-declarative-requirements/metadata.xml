	<longdescription># Declarative `setuptools` Config Requirements Files SupportThis projects adds the ability for projects using setuptools declarative configurationto specify requirements using requirements files.### ⚠ **There's a reason why this isn't, at least yet, supported by default. Please [read why](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1951).**Anyway, if you know what you're doing, then this library solves the missing featureof defining requirements using requirements files.## `setup.cfg`Your `setup.cfg` should include a section named `requirements-files`, like:```ini[requirements-files]setup_requires = requirements/setup.txtinstall_requires = requirements/base.txttests_require = requirements/tests.txtextras_require =  docs = requirements/docs.txt  cli = requirements/cli.txt```### ⚠ ATTENTION#### The requirements files **MUST** be included in the wheel file aswell as the source tarballFor the example shown above, in ``setup.cfg``, add something like:```ini[options.data_files]. = requirements/*.txt```Or something like the folowing on your ``MANIFEST.in``:```include requirements/*.txt```Or, if you use [setuptools-scm](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm), the requirements filesneed to be committed to the SCM repo.## `pyproject.toml`Your `pyproject.toml` should also include `setuptools-declarative-requirements`:```toml[build-system]requires = [&quot;setuptools&gt;=50.3.2&quot;, &quot;wheel&quot;, &quot;setuptools-declarative-requirements&quot;]build-backend = &quot;setuptools.build_meta&quot;```## `setup.py`Some projects still use a `setup.py` shim, similar to:```python#!/usr/bin/env pythonimport setuptoolsif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    setuptools.setup()```If this is your case, your `setup.cfg` needs an extra bit of tweak. Make sure you have``setuptools-declarative-requirements`` in your `setup_requires`:```ini[options]setup_requires =  setuptools&gt;=50.3.2  setuptools-declarative-requirements```## Do Note That### ⚠ This project makes no attempt to validate your requirements files.**The only thing it does is include every non empty line from your requirements files which doesnot start with `#`, `-r` or `--`.**</longdescription>
