	<longdescription>## maelstrom-radiationA dataset plugin for climetlab (https://climetlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the dataset maelstrom-radiation.## Datasets descriptionThis data is for learning theemulation of the ECMWF radiation scheme, using the McICA solver, found in the ecRad package (https://github.com/ecmwf/ecrad). Building an accurate emulator of radiative heatingcould accelerate weather and climate models partially by enabling the use of GPUhardware within our models.There are two datasets, allowing different views on the same data:### 1 : `maelstom-radiation`Supports the `to_xarray` method and allows users to explore the data with all structure kept intact.### 2 : `maelstrom-radiation-tf`Loads the same data but from a shuffled and repacked into the TFRecord format. This dataset supports `to_tfdataset` which uses Tensorflow's dataset object.## Using climetlab to access the data Both datasets and downloaded and explained in the demo notebook herehttps://git.ecmwf.int/projects/MLFET/repos/maelstrom-radiation/browse/notebooks/demo_radiation.ipynbThe climetlab python package allows easy access to the data with a few lines of code such as:```!pip install climetlab climetlab_maelstrom_radiationimport climetlab as cmlcml_ds = cml.load_dataset(&quot;maelstrom-radiation&quot;, subset=&quot;tier-1&quot;)ds = cml_ds.to_xarray()!or for the TFdataset versioncml_ds = cml.load_dataset(&quot;maelstrom-radiation-tf&quot;, subset=&quot;tier-1&quot;)ds = cml_ds.to_tfdataset(batch_size=256)```</longdescription>
