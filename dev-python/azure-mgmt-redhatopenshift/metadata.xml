	<longdescription># Microsoft Azure SDK for PythonThis is the Microsoft Azure Red Hat Openshift Management Client Library.This package has been tested with Python 3.7+.For a more complete view of Azure libraries, see the [azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).## _Disclaimer__Azure SDK Python packages support for Python 2.7 has ended 01 January 2022. For more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_## Getting started### Prerequisites- Python 3.7+ is required to use this package.- [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)### Install the package```bashpip install azure-mgmt-redhatopenshiftpip install azure-identity```### AuthenticationBy default, [Azure Active Directory](https://aka.ms/awps/aad) token authentication depends on correct configure of following environment variables.- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` for Azure client ID.- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` for Azure tenant ID.- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` for Azure client secret.In addition, Azure subscription ID can be configured via environment variable `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.With above configuration, client can be authenticated by following code:```pythonfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredentialfrom azure.mgmt.redhatopenshift import AzureRedHatOpenShiftClientimport ossub_id = os.getenv(&quot;AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID&quot;)client = AzureRedHatOpenShiftClient(credential=DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id=sub_id)```## ExamplesCode samples for this package can be found at:- [Search Red Hat Openshift Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&amp;term=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing&amp;terms=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing) on docs.microsoft.com- [Azure Python Mgmt SDK Samples Repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)## Troubleshooting## Next steps## Provide FeedbackIf you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the[Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)section of the project. # Release History## 1.4.0 (2023-10-23)### Features Added  - Model NetworkProfile has a new parameter preconfigured_nsg  - Model OpenShiftCluster has a new parameter worker_profiles_status  - Model OpenShiftClusterUpdate has a new parameter worker_profiles_status## 1.3.0 (2023-08-18)### Features Added  - Model NetworkProfile has a new parameter outbound_type## 1.3.0b1 (2023-02-16)### Other Changes  - Added generated samples in github repo  - Drop support for python&lt;3.7.0## 1.2.0 (2023-01-17)### Features Added  - Added operation group MachinePoolsOperations  - Added operation group OpenShiftVersionsOperations  - Added operation group SecretsOperations  - Added operation group SyncIdentityProvidersOperations  - Added operation group SyncSetsOperations  - Model Resource has a new parameter system_data  - Model TrackedResource has a new parameter system_data## 1.1.0 (2022-05-10)**Features**  - Added operation OpenShiftClustersOperations.list_admin_credentials  - Model ClusterProfile has a new parameter fips_validated_modules  - Model MasterProfile has a new parameter disk_encryption_set_id  - Model MasterProfile has a new parameter encryption_at_host  - Model OpenShiftCluster has a new parameter system_data  - Model OpenShiftClusterUpdate has a new parameter system_data  - Model WorkerProfile has a new parameter disk_encryption_set_id  - Model WorkerProfile has a new parameter encryption_at_host## 1.0.0 (2021-05-20)- GA release## 1.0.0b1 (2020-12-10)This is beta preview version.This version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).**General breaking changes**- Credential system has been completly revamped:  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user  - For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)**General new features**- Type annotations support using `typing`. SDKs are mypy ready.- This client has now stable and official support for async. Check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.- This client now support natively tracing library like OpenCensus or OpenTelemetry. See this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.## 0.1.0 (2020-03-28)* Initial Release</longdescription>
