	<longdescription>.. inclusion-marker-1-5-do-not-removecoffea is a prototype package for pulling together all the typical needsof a high-energy collider physics (HEP) experiment analysis using the scientificpython ecosystem. It makes use of `uproot &lt;https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot4&gt;`_and `awkward-array &lt;https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0&gt;`_ to provide anarray-based syntax for manipulating HEP event data in an efficient and numpythonicway. There are sub-packages that implement histogramming, plotting, and look-uptable functionalities that are needed to convey scientific insight, apply transformationsto data, and correct for discrepancies in Monte Carlo simulations compared to data.coffea also supplies facilities for horizontally scaling an analysis in order to reducetime-to-insight in a way that is largely independent of the resource the analysisis being executed on. By making use of modern *big-data* technologies like`Apache Spark &lt;https://spark.apache.org/&gt;`_,  `parsl &lt;https://github.com/Parsl/parsl&gt;`_,`Dask &lt;https://dask.org&gt;`_ , and `Work Queue &lt;http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/workqueue&gt;`_,it is possible with coffea to scale a HEP analysis from a testingon a laptop to: a large multi-core server, computing clusters, and super-computers withoutthe need to alter or otherwise adapt the analysis code itself.coffea is a HEP community project collaborating with `iris-hep &lt;http://iris-hep.org/&gt;`_and is currently a prototype. We welcome input to improve its quality as we progress towardsa sensible refactorization into the scientific python ecosystem and a first release. Pleasefeel free to contribute at our `github repo &lt;https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea&gt;`_!.. inclusion-marker-2-do-not-removeInstallation============Install coffea like any other Python package:.. code-block:: bash    pip install coffeaor similar (use ``sudo``, ``--user``, ``virtualenv``, or pip-in-conda if you wish).For more details, see the `Installing coffea &lt;https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea/installation.html&gt;`_ section of the documentation.Strict dependencies===================- `Python &lt;http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/&gt;`__ (3.6+)The following are installed automatically when you install coffea with pip:- `numpy &lt;https://scipy.org/install.html&gt;`__ (1.15+);- `uproot &lt;https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot4&gt;`__ for interacting with ROOT files and handling their data transparently;- `awkward-array &lt;https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0&gt;`__ to manipulate complex-structured columnar data, such as jagged arrays;- `numba &lt;https://numba.pydata.org/&gt;`__ just-in-time compilation of python functions;- `scipy &lt;https://scipy.org/scipylib/index.html&gt;`__ for many statistical functions;- `matplotlib &lt;https://matplotlib.org/&gt;`__ as a plotting backend;- and other utility packages, as enumerated in ``setup.py``.</longdescription>
