	<longdescription># Brawling 2.0Sync + async wrapper for the Brawl Stars API (additionally via an unofficial proxy) and BrawlAPI by Brawlify## InstallationTo install normally (only sync, no cache)```pip install brawling```There are three additional extras you can install: `async`, `cache`, `acache`To install with caching support (only sync, installs `requests-cache`)```pip install brawling[cache]```To install with async support (will install `aiohttp`)```pip install brawling[async]```To install with async caching support (will also install `aiohttp`, `aiohttp-client-cache` and `aiosqlite`)```pip install brawling[acache]```## UsageUsage is fairly simple and straightforward:```pyimport brawling# either a token, or a path to the file with itTOKEN = &quot;...&quot;client = brawling.Client(TOKEN)player = client.get_player(&quot;#YOURTAG&quot;)print(f&quot;Hi, {player.tag}&quot;)# or, asynchronouslyclient = brawling.AsyncClient(TOKEN)player = await client.get_player(&quot;#YOURTAG&quot;)print(f&quot;Hi, {player.tag}&quot;)```If you only need to make one or few calls, you can use a context manager:```pywith brawling.Client(TOKEN) as client:    player = client.get_player(&quot;#YOURTAG&quot;)# or, asynchronouslyasync with brawling.AsyncClient(TOKEN) as client:    player = await client.get_player(&quot;#YOURTAG&quot;)```If you want to paginate over data, there are also paginator functions available to do exactly that:```pypages = client.page_brawler_rankings(    brawling.BrawlerID.SHELLY,    per_page=10, region='us', max=200)# ^ this operation was immediate, no data was fetched yetfor page in pages:    # prints a list of 10 items    print(page)# if asynchronous, use 'await client.page_xx()' and 'async for'```When initializing a client, there are additional options:```pyClient(token: str,       proxy = False,       strict_errors = True,       cache = False)````proxy` - uses the Royale API proxy (read [Special thanks](#special-thanks) before using!) to make requests, useful if you don't have a static IP.`strict_errors` - throw an error if the API returned one, if set to `False`, will return an `ErrorResponse` object instead.`cache` - enables caching of responses, caching period is determined by either the API, or a fallback default value of 10 minutes.## Common issuesIf you are having troubles with getting the `AsyncClient` to work, make sure that you initialize it inside an asynchronous function, like so:```pyclient = None# correctasync def init():    client = brawling.AsyncClient(&quot;...&quot;)asyncio.run(init())# wrongclient = brawling.AsyncClient(&quot;...&quot;)```## Special thanksThanks to [brawlify](https://brawlify.com) for the amazing project [BrawlAPI](https://brawlapi.com)Thanks to [Royale API](https://royaleapi.com/) for providing a [proxy service](https://docs.royaleapi.com/proxy.html#how-to-use-with-the-clash-royale-api) to bypass the static IP limitationNOTE: These two tools were made by neither me nor Supercell.
