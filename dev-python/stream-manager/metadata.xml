	<longdescription>## AWS Greengrass Stream Manager SDK for PythonThe **AWS Greengrass Stream Manager SDK for Python** enables Python developers to manage data streams using [StreamManager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/manage-data-streams.html) on AWS IoT Greengrass core.## OverviewThis document provides instructions for preparing your Python code to manage Streams in Stream Manager using the PythonSDK.## Using Stream Manager Client to work with StreamsFollow the guide [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/work-with-streams.html) to workwith Streams using the Stream Manager Client from the Stream Manager SDK.View Python SDK documentation [here](https://aws-greengrass.github.io/aws-greengrass-stream-manager-sdk-python/).## CompatibilityStream Manager SDK provided by this repo is compatible with Stream Manager running on Greengrass Core 1.11 and above.## RequirementsThis SDK has additional requirements. Specifically, Stream Manager SDK requires Python version 3.6 or above. It also has package requirements listed in the requirements.txt file. Please install these requirements.To install the requirements you can use pip such as :code:`pip install --user -r requirements.txt`. This will installthe requirements to your Python path on the device. However if you are deploying the code to a device, you can bundlethe requirements with your code. With the pip command above, the dependencies will be installed to the usersite-packages directory. To find its location, use :code:`python -m site --user-site`. You can then simply copy theentire user site package directory contents into the final artifact before deploying which will ensure that the StreamManager dependencies are present.## InstallationOne way to install both stream-manager and its dependencies (i.e. cbor) is to run the following command:```consolepip3 install stream_manager```## Getting Help*   [Ask on AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/)## LicenseApache 2.0</longdescription>
