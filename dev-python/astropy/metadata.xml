This repository contains the core package which isintended to contain much of the core functionality and some common tools neededfor performing astronomy and astrophysics with Python.Releases are `registered on PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/astropy&gt;`_,and development is occurring at the`project's GitHub page &lt;http://github.com/astropy/astropy&gt;`_.For installation instructions, see the `online documentation &lt;https://docs.astropy.org/&gt;`_or  `docs/install.rst &lt;docs/install.rst&gt;`_ in this source distribution.Contributing Code, Documentation, or Feedback---------------------------------------------The Astropy Project is made both by and for its users, so we welcome andencourage contributions of many kinds. Our goal is to keep this a positive,inclusive, successful, and growing community by abiding with the`Astropy Community Code of Conduct &lt;http://www.astropy.org/about.html#codeofconduct&gt;`_.More detailed information on contributing to the project or submitting feedbackcan be found on the `contributions &lt;http://www.astropy.org/contribute.html&gt;`_page. A `summary of contribution guidelines &lt;CONTRIBUTING.md&gt;`_ can also beused as a quick reference when you are ready to start writing or validatingcode for submission.Getting started with GitHub Codespaces--------------------------------------Codespaces is a cloud development environment supported by GitHub. None of the Astropy build machinery depends on it, but it is a convenient way to quickly get started doing development on Astropy.To get started, create a codespace for this repository by clicking this ðŸ‘‡|Codespaces|A codespace will open in a web-based version of Visual Studio Code. The `dev container &lt;.devcontainer/devcontainer.json&gt;`_ is fully configured with software needed for this project. Feel free to take a look at `GitHub Codespaces Support &lt;https://support.github.com/features/codespaces&gt;`_ page for help.**Note**: Dev containers is an open spec which is supported by `GitHub Codespaces &lt;https://github.com/codespaces&gt;`_ and `other tools &lt;https://containers.dev/supporting&gt;`_.Supporting the Project----------------------|NumFOCUS| |Donate|The Astropy Project is sponsored by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in theUnited States. You can donate to the project by using the link above, and thisdonation will support our mission to promote sustainable, high-level code basefor the astronomy community, open code development, educational materials, andreproducible scientific research.License-------Astropy is licensed under a 3-clause BSD style license - see the`LICENSE.rst &lt;LICENSE.rst&gt;`_ file... |Actions Status| image:: https://github.com/astropy/astropy/workflows/CI/badge.svg    :target: https://github.com/astropy/astropy/actions    :alt: Astropy's GitHub Actions CI Status.. |CircleCI Status| image::  https://img.shields.io/circleci/build/github/astropy/astropy/main?logo=circleci&amp;label=CircleCI    :target: https://circleci.com/gh/astropy/astropy    :alt: Astropy's CircleCI Status.. |Coverage Status| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/astropy/astropy/branch/main/graph/badge.svg    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/astropy/astropy    :alt: Astropy's Coverage Status.. |PyPI Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/astropy.svg    :target: https://pypi.org/project/astropy    :alt: Astropy's PyPI Status.. |Zenodo| image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4670728.svg   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4670728   :alt: Zenodo DOI.. |Documentation Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/astropy/latest.svg?logo=read%20the%20docs&amp;logoColor=white&amp;label=Docs&amp;version=stable    :target: https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/?badge=stable    :alt: Documentation Status.. |Pre-Commit| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/pre--commit-enabled-brightgreen?logo=pre-commit&amp;logoColor=white   :target: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit   :alt: pre-commit.. |isort Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/%20imports-isort-%231674b1?style=flat&amp;labelColor=ef8336    :target: https://pycqa.github.io/isort/    :alt: isort Status.. |black| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg    :target: https://github.com/psf/black.. |NumFOCUS| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/powered%20by-NumFOCUS-orange.svg?style=flat&amp;colorA=E1523D&amp;colorB=007D8A    :target: http://numfocus.org    :alt: Powered by NumFOCUS.. |Donate| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-to%20Astropy-brightgreen.svg    :target: https://numfocus.salsalabs.org/donate-to-astropy/index.html.. |Codespaces| image:: https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg    :target: https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&amp;ref=main&amp;repo=2081289    :alt: Open in GitHub CodespacesIf you locally cloned this repo before 7 Apr 2021-------------------------------------------------The primary branch for this repo has been transitioned from ``master`` to``main``.  If you have a local clone of this repository and want to keep yourlocal branch in sync with this repo, you'll need to do the following in yourlocal clone from your terminal::   git fetch --all --prune   # you can stop here if you don't use your local &quot;master&quot;/&quot;main&quot; branch   git branch -m master main   git branch -u origin/main mainIf you are using a GUI to manage your repos you'll have to find the equivalentcommands as it's different for different programs. Alternatively, you can justdelete your local clone and re-clone!</longdescription>
