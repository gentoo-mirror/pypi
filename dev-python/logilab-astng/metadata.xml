	<longdescription>ASTNG=====What's this ?-------------The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation ofpython source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse,pylint... Well, actually the development of this library is essentiallygoverned by pylint's needs.It provides a compatible representation which comes from the `_ast` module.It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by recursivelywalking down the AST and building an extended ast (let's call it astng ;). Thenew node classes have additional methods and attributes for different usages.They include some support for static inference and local name scopes.Furthermore, astng builds partial trees by inspecting living objects.Main modules are:* `bases`, `node_classses` and `scoped_nodes` contain the classes for the  different type of nodes of the tree.* the `manager` contains a high level object to get astng trees from  source files and living objects. It maintains a cache of previously  constructed tree for quick accessInstallation------------Extract the tarball, jump into the created directory and run ::python setup.py installFor installation options, see ::python setup.py install --helpIf you have any questions, please mail thepython-project@lists.logilab.org mailing list for support. Seehttp://lists.logilab.org/mailman/listinfo/python-projects forsubscription information and archives.Test----Tests are in the 'test' subdirectory. To launch the whole tests suiteat once, you may use the 'pytest' utility from logilab-common (simplytype 'pytest' from within this directory) or if you're running python&gt;= 2.7, using discover, for instance::  python -m unittest discover -p &quot;unittest*.py&quot;</longdescription>
