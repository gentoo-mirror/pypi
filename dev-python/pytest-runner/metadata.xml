For example 'setup_requires' and 'tests_require' bypass ``pip --require-hashes``.See also `pypa/setuptools#1684 &lt;https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1684&gt;`_.It is recommended that you:- Remove ``'pytest-runner'`` from your ``setup_requires``, preferably removing the ``setup_requires`` option.- Remove ``'pytest'`` and any other testing requirements from ``tests_require``, preferably removing the ``tests_requires`` option.- Select a tool to bootstrap and then run tests such as tox.Usage=====- Add 'pytest-runner' to your 'setup_requires'. Pin to '&gt;=2.0,&lt;3dev' (or  similar) to avoid pulling in incompatible versions.- Include 'pytest' and any other testing requirements to 'tests_require'.- Invoke tests with ``setup.py pytest``.- Pass ``--index-url`` to have test requirements downloaded from an alternate  index URL (unnecessary if specified for easy_install in setup.cfg).- Pass additional py.test command-line options using ``--addopts``.- Set permanent options for the ``python setup.py pytest`` command (like ``index-url``)  in the ``[pytest]`` section of ``setup.cfg``.- Set permanent options for the ``py.test`` run (like ``addopts`` or ``pep8ignore``) in the ``[pytest]``  section of ``pytest.ini`` or ``tox.ini`` or put them in the ``[tool:pytest]``  section of ``setup.cfg``. See `pytest issue 567  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/567&gt;`_.- Optionally, set ``test=pytest`` in the ``[aliases]`` section of ``setup.cfg``  to cause ``python setup.py test`` to invoke pytest.Example=======The most simple usage looks like this in setup.py::    setup(        setup_requires=[            'pytest-runner',        ],        tests_require=[            'pytest',        ],    )Additional dependencies require to run the tests (e.g. mock or pytestplugins) may be added to tests_require and will be downloaded andrequired by the session before invoking pytest.Follow `this search on github&lt;https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=filename%3Asetup.py+pytest-runner&amp;type=Code&amp;ref=searchresults&gt;`_for examples of real-world usage.Standalone Example==================This technique is deprecated - if you have standalone scriptsyou wish to invoke with dependencies, `use pip-run&lt;https://pypi.org/project/pip-run&gt;`_.Although ``pytest-runner`` is typically used to add pytest testrunner support to maintained packages, ``pytest-runner`` mayalso be used to create standalone tests. Consider `this examplefailure &lt;https://gist.github.com/jaraco/d979a558bc0bf2194c23&gt;`_,reported in `jsonpickle #117&lt;https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/117&gt;`_or `this MongoDB test&lt;https://gist.github.com/jaraco/0b9e482f5c0a1300dc9a&gt;`_demonstrating a technique that works even when dependenciesare required in the test.Either example file may be cloned or downloaded and simply run onany system with Python and Setuptools. It will download thespecified dependencies and run the tests. Afterward, the thecloned directory can be removed and with it all trace ofinvoking the test. No other dependencies are needed and nosystem configuration is altered.Then, anyone trying to replicate the failure can do so easilyand with all the power of pytest (rewritten assertions,rich comparisons, interactive debugging, extensibility throughplugins, etc).As a result, the communication barrier for describing andreplicating failures is made almost trivially low.Considerations==============Conditional Requirement-----------------------Because it uses Setuptools setup_requires, pytest-runner will install itselfon every invocation of setup.py. In some cases, this causes delays forinvocations of setup.py that will never invoke pytest-runner. To help avoidthis contingency, consider requiring pytest-runner only when pytestis invoked::    needs_pytest = {'pytest', 'test', 'ptr'}.intersection(sys.argv)    pytest_runner = ['pytest-runner'] if needs_pytest else []    # ...    setup(        #...        setup_requires=[            #... (other setup requirements)        ] + pytest_runner,    )For Enterprise==============Available as part of the Tidelift Subscription.This project and the maintainers of thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver one enterprise subscription that covers all of the open source you use.`Learn more &lt;https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-PROJECT?utm_source=pypi-PROJECT&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=github&gt;`_.Security Contact================To report a security vulnerability, please use the`Tidelift security contact &lt;https://tidelift.com/security&gt;`_.Tidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure.</longdescription>
