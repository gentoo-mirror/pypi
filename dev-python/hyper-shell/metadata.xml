It is a highlyscalable workflow automation tool for *many-task* scenarios.Several tools offer similar functionality but not all together in a single tool withthe ergonomics we provide. Novel design elements include but are not limited to(1) cross-platform, (2) client-server design, (3) staggered launch for large scales,(4) persistent hosting of the server, and optionally (5) a database in-the-loop forpersisting task metadata and automated retries.*HyperShell* is pure Python and is tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows 10 inPython 3.9+ environments. The server and client don't even need to use the sameplatform simultaneously.Documentation-------------Documentation is available at `hyper-shell.readthedocs.io &lt;https://hyper-shell.readthedocs.io&gt;`_.For basic usage information on the command line use: ``hyper-shell --help``. For a more comprehensive usage guide on the command line you can view the manual page with ``man hyper-shell``.Contributions-------------Contributions are welcome.
