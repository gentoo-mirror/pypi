Please support them in their efforts to maintain and improve Cookiecutter Django:* [pydanny on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pydanny)Projects that provide financial support to the maintainer:- [Django Crash Course 3.x](https://www.feldroy.com/products/django-crash-course)- [Two Scoops of Django 3.x](https://www.feldroy.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-3-x)# About the forkThis project is a fork of the &quot;django-pagination&quot; projectoriginally written by 'Eric Florenzano' then forked by the LinaroValidation/Infrastructure team. Latest releases can be found on pypi.# About top-level package name changeThe top level package name was changed from `pagination` to`linaro_django_pagination` to `dj_pagination`. Following the Linaro patternI did this to ensure that existing users of the original package could easilytransition, on their own terms. Since both packages are co-installable youare free to check things out and see if the new pagination code works well foryou or not.Since the implementation of the actual tags were rewritten since thedjango-pagination days it's fairly certain the new package is a NOT adrop-in replacement.</longdescription>
