For more information, visit the project website:    http://pyenchant.github.io/pyenchant/What is Enchant?----------------Enchant is used to check the spelling of words and suggest correctionsfor words that are miss-spelled.  It can use many popular spellcheckingpackages to perform this task, including ispell, aspell and MySpell.  Itis quite flexible at handling multiple dictionaries and multiplelanguages.More information is available on the Enchant website:    https://abiword.github.io/enchant/How do I use it?----------------For Windows users, install the pre-built binary packages usingpip::    pip install pyenchantThese packages bundle a pre-built copy of the underlying enchant library.Users on other platforms will need to install &quot;enchant&quot; using their systempackage manager (brew on macOS).Once the software is installed, python's on-line help facilities canget you started.  Launch python and issue the following commands:    &gt;&gt;&gt; import enchant    &gt;&gt;&gt; help(enchant)Who is responsible for all this?--------------------------------The credit for Enchant itself goes to Dom Lachowicz.  Find out more detailson the Enchant website listed above.  Full marks to Dom for producing sucha high-quality library.The glue to pull Enchant into Python via ctypes was written by Ryan Kelly.He needed a decent spellchecker for another project he was working on, andall the solutions turned up by Google were either extremely non-portable(e.g. opening a pipe to ispell) or had completely disappeared from the web(what happened to SnakeSpell?)  It was also a great excuse to teach himselfabout SWIG, ctypes, and even a little bit of the Python/C API.Finally, after Ryan stepped down from the project, Dimitri Merejkowskybecame the new maintainer.</longdescription>
