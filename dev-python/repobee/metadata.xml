The archetypical use case is toautomate creation of student repositories based on template repositories, thatcan contain for example instructions and skeleton code. Given any number oftemplate repositories, creating a copy for each student or group is[just one command away](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/repos.html#set-up-student-repositories-the-setup-action).RepoBee also has functionality for[updating student repos](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/repos.html#updating-student-repositories-the-update-action),[batch cloning of student repos](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/repos.html#cloning-repos-in-bulk-the-clone-action),[opening, closing and listing issues](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/issues.html),[no-blind](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/peer.html) and[double-blind](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/peer.html#double-blind-peer-review)peer review, and much more!In addition, RepoBee features a powerful[plugin system](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/plugins.html) that allowsusers to either use existing plugins, or[write their own](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/repobee_plug/index.html).Plugins can do a wide range of things, including making RepoBee compatible withmultiple hosting platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea), providing compatibilitywith repositories managed by GitHub Classroom, or running JUnit4 test classeson cloned student repositories.Still not quite sure what RepoBee actually does? The demo video below brieflyexplains some of the most important concepts, and showcases how RepoBee can beused to setup and clone student repositories, as well as how to write a simpleplugin.https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14223379/121573132-2d725380-ca25-11eb-8aa0-8f50ac3f28f0.mp4&gt; Short video demonstration of using RepoBee and writing a simple plugin. [For a higher-quality version of this demo, click this link!](https://repobee.org/media/repobee-demo.mp4)### Feature highlightsRepoBee has a lot going for it. Here are some of the things we are most proudof:* Compatible with GitHub, GitLab and Gitea: No platform lock-in!* Support for group assignments (multiple students per repository)* No-blind and double-blind peer review, directly on the hosting platform* Generate, clone and update student repositories based on templates* Open, close and list issues* Extend and customize RepoBee with the  [plugin system](https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins.html)* Very little configuration required on the Git service platform side    - The only requirement is to have an Organization/Group with private repository      capabilities!* No local configuration required    - Although [setting a few defaults](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/getting_started.html#configure-repobee-for-the-target-organization-the-config-category)      is highly recommendedFor a full list of RepoBee's built-in (i.e. non-plugin) features, see the[user guide](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/userguide.html) and[CLI reference](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/cli.html).### Getting startedFirst, either [install RepoBee](#install) or grab the [Docker image](#docker).Then, start exploring the [Docs](https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),where you (among other things) will find the [userguide](https://repobee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/userguide.html). It covers useof RepoBee's various commands by way of practical example, and should set youon the right path with little effort.We also provide a [Gitea test instance](https://gitea.repobee.org) for playingaround around with RepoBee in an environment where messing up has noconsequence. See the[RepoBee Gitea docs](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/gitea.html) for detailson how to use RepoBee with Gitea.### InstallWe provide an install script that sets up an isolated and correctly configuredenvironment for RepoBee, granted that you have [Python 3.7+ and Gitinstalled](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/install.html#requirements). The scriptsupports macOS, Linux and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). You can execute itdirectly using `curl`, with either `bash` or `zsh`.&gt; **IMPORTANT:** If you use any other shell than bash or zsh, you must still&gt; execute the install script with one of them.```bash$ bash &lt;(curl -s https://repobee.org/install.sh)``````bash$ zsh &lt;(curl -s https://repobee.org/install.sh)```For additional details, please see [the installdocs](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/install.html).### DockerWe offer a fully featured[Docker image](https://docs.repobee.org/en/stable/docker.html#docker-usage)that can be used instead of installing RepoBee.## VersioningAs of December 17th 2018, RepoBee's CLI is a stable release and adheres to[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). The internalsof RepoBee _do not_ adhere to this versioning, so using RepoBee as a libraryis not recommended.The plugin system is mostly stable as of RepoBee 3.0, but there is a slightrisk of breakage due to unforeseen problems. **If you develop a plugin, pleaseget in touch so that can be taken into consideration if breaking changes areintroduced to the plugin system**.## LicenseThis software is licensed under the MIT License.
