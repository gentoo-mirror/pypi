	<longdescription># replenoRepleno allows you to easily answer supply chain questions considering bill ofmaterials (BOM) structure.- **PyPI**: https://pypi.org/project/repleno/ - **Source code**: - **Documentation**: - **Bug reports**: It answers the following questions:1. &quot;Which finished/purchased goods are associated with this stock keeping unit (SKU)?&quot;2. &quot;Based on this master production schedule (MPS), which specific SKU quantities should be ordered from suppliers?&quot;3. &quot;Using the master requirements planning (MRP) results and current supplier orders, when will there be stock-out periods?&quot;4. &quot;If I discontinue SKU X, which other SKU's will also need to be discontinued?&quot;By providing:- efficient queries about parent-child relationships for SKUs in the BOM- MRP simulations to analyze the impact of MPS changes on purchase orders to suppliers- inventory levels over a specific time periods- identification of collateral SKU's that need to be phased-out along with a specific SKUInstalling:```bashpython -m pip install requests```## Roadmap:1. Integrate phantom scenarios to `run_mrp` and `get_lineage` and `get_collaterals` methods;2. issue a warning when a parameter is not being loaded or a column has not been found;3. get_collaterals function should return a tree, so it can be used to fully deplete the inventory inside it;4. run special mrp for scenarios: produce all inventory left in the BOM (placing more order to deplete everything or with scrapage);5. method for propagating any general label from roots to child nodes (from fininshed goods to purchased goods, in supply chain terms);6. Method for quickly answering the question: if one component goes out of stock, what's the impact on the finished goods?7. per component, shows how much of its demand impact finished goods. If 1 component goes into only 1 FG, then 100%8. Add support to add lead times in different units (currently only support calendar days), like weeks or months</longdescription>
