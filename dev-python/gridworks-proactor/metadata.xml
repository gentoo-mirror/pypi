This separationallows the scada code to be more focussed on on application specific details and provides the potential to re-use the&quot;live actor&quot; and &quot;application monitored&quot; infrastructure.## Features- [](Proactor), a single threaded event loop running on asyncio, for exchanging messages between the main application  object, &quot;live actor&quot; subobjects and MQTT clients.- A [communication state] (&quot;active&quot; or not) for each external communications link is available to the proactor and  sub-objects. &quot;Active&quot; communications is defined as ALL of the following:  - The underlying communications mechanism (MQTT) is connected.  - All input channels of underlying mechanism (MQTT topics) are established.  - A application messages requiring acknowledgement have been ACKed in timely fashion (by default 5 seconds).  - A message has been received &quot;recently&quot; (by default within 1 minute).- Reliable delievery of &quot;Events&quot; generated locally. Generated Events are stored locally until they are acknowledged  and unacknowledged Events are retransmitted when the &quot;Active&quot; communication state is restored.- [](gwproactor_test), a test package for development and test environments of projects that implement a class derived  from [](Proactor), allowing the derived class to be tested with the base-class tests.## RequirementsTesting requires an MQTT broker. This can be installed on a mac with:```shellbrew install mosquittobrew services restart mosquitto```Alternatively, the MQTT broker used by tests be controlled by .env file as described in [](DefaultTestEnv).## InstallationYou can install _Gridworks Proactor_ via [pip] from [PyPI]:```console$ pip install gridworks-proactor```## ContributingContributions are very welcome. In order to develop, do this:```console$ poetry install --all-extras```To learn more, see the [Contributor Guide].## LicenseDistributed under the terms of the [MIT license][license],_Gridworks Proactor_ is free and open source software.## IssuesIf you encounter any problems,please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.## CreditsThis project was generated from [@cjolowicz]'s [Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter] template.[@cjolowicz]: https://github.com/cjolowicz[pypi]: https://pypi.org/[hypermodern python cookiecutter]: https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python[file an issue]: https://github.com/thegridelectric/gridworks-proactor/issues[pip]: https://pip.pypa.io/&lt;!-- github-only --&gt;[license]: https://github.com/thegridelectric/gridworks-proactor/blob/main/LICENSE[contributor guide]: https://github.com/thegridelectric/gridworks-proactor/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md[communication state]: https://gridworks-proactor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comm_state.html</longdescription>
