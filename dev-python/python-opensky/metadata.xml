The format of the log is based on[Keep a Changelog][keepchangelog].Releases are based on [Semantic Versioning][semver], and use the formatof ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``. In a nutshell, the version will be incrementedbased on the following:- ``MAJOR``: Incompatible or major changes.- ``MINOR``: Backwards-compatible new features and enhancements.- ``PATCH``: Backwards-compatible bugfixes and package updates.## ContributingThis is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want touse the code or contribute to it.We've set up a separate document for our[contribution guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:## Setting up development environmentThis Python project is fully managed using the [Poetry][poetry] dependency manager. But also relies on the use of NodeJS for certain checks during development.You need at least:- Python 3.10+- [Poetry][poetry-install]- NodeJS 12+ (including NPM)To install all packages, including all development requirements:```bashnpm installpoetry install```As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changesare linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and testsmanually, using the following command:```bashpoetry run pre-commit run --all-files```To run just the Python tests:```bashpoetry run pytest```## Authors &amp; contributorsThe original setup of this repository is heavily inspired by [Franck Nijhof][frenck].The content is by [Joost Lekkerkerker][joostlek]For a full list of all authors and contributors,check [the contributor's page][contributors].## LicenseMIT LicenseCopyright (c) 2023 Joost LekkerkerkerPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
