	<longdescription>=================AboutCode Toolkit=================Introduction------------The AboutCode Toolkit and ABOUT files provide a simple way to document theorigin, license, usage and other important or interesting information aboutthird-party software components that you use in your project.You start by storing ABOUT files (a small YAML formatted text file with field/value pairs)side-by-side with each of the third-party software components you use.Each ABOUT file documents origin and license for one software.There are many examples of ABOUT files (valid or invalid) in the testdata/directory of the whole repository.The current version of the AboutCode Toolkit can read these ABOUT files so that youcan collect and validate the inventory of third-party components that you use.In addition, this tool is able to generate attribution notices andidentify redistributable source code used in your project to help you complywith open source licenses conditions.This version of the AboutCode Toolkit follows the ABOUT specification version 3.3.1 at:https://aboutcode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specification.htmlBuild and tests status----------------------+-------+-----------------+--------------+|Branch | **Linux/macOS** | **Windows**  |+=======+=================+==============+|Master | |master-posix|  | |master-win| |+-------+-----------------+--------------+|Develop| |devel-posix|   | |devel-win|  |+-------+-----------------+--------------+REQUIREMENTS------------The AboutCode Toolkit is tested with Python 3.7 or above only on Linux, Mac and Windows.You will need to install a Python interpreter if you do not have one alreadyinstalled.On Linux and Mac, Python is typically pre-installed. To verify whichversion may be pre-installed, open a terminal and type:    python --versionNote~~~~    Debian has decided that distutils is not a core python package, so it is not included in the last versions of debian and debian-based OSes.    A solution is to run: `sudo apt install python3-distutils`On Windows or Mac, you can download the latest Python here:    https://www.python.org/downloads/Download the .msi installer for Windows or the .dmg archive for Mac.Open and run the installer using all the default options.INSTALLATION------------Checkout or download and extract the AboutCode Toolkit from:    https://github.com/nexB/aboutcode-toolkit/To install all the needed dependencies in a virtualenv, run (on posix):    ./configureor on windows:    configureACTIVATE the VIRTUALENV-----------------------To activate the virtualenv, run (on posix):    source venv/bin/activateor on windows:    venv\\bin\\activateDEACTIVATE the VIRTUALENV-------------------------To deactivate the virtualenv, run (on both posix and windows):    deactivateVERSIONING SCHEMA-----------------Starting at AboutCode version 4.0.0, the AboutCode Toolkit will follow SemVer for the versioning schema.i.e. MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format    1.
