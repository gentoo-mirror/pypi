If your operating system ask you to choose an application, you can use a simple text editoror your IDE of choice like PyCharm, IDLE, Visual Studio Code, etc.###### *opened data.ini file (in PyCharm)*![private prefs data.ini file](https://github.com/DarrenHaba/privateprefs/blob/master/images/privateprefs_data_file.png?raw=true)We can add, remove, update, and delete key-value pairs by directly editing the data.ini file. Let's add the key `my_email` with a value of `darren@spammed.com` to the file manually.###### *data.ini with newly added line*![private prefs data.ini file](https://github.com/DarrenHaba/privateprefs/blob/master/images/privateprefs_date_file_add_key_value.png?raw=true)For those who don't like to use the cli (command line interface) feel free to edit the data.ini file directly, but please follow a few rules to ensure you don't break the package1. The first line must contain `[privateprefs]`2. the next lines must be `my_key = my value` pairs3. don't add quotes to strings like `my_key = &quot;my value&quot;` (don't do this!)4. it's best to use the same name rules for keys as with [Python variables name](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_variable_names.asp)### Delete Value```shprivateprefs delete &quot;secret_api_key&quot;```### Delete All Values###### &lt;sub&gt; *-- WARNING ALL SAVED DATA WILL BE PERMANENTLY DELETED --* &lt;/sub&gt;```sh# don't run if you have saved data you want to keepprivateprefs delete_all```### ConclusionYou now have a basic understanding of how `privateprefs` works and how to use it. We left out a few Python functions and CLI commands, but they are covered in the docs below if you're interested.## Python DocsThe following Python code assumes we have the following two savedkey-value pairs###### *run these commands to add some data for testing*```shprivateprefs save my_key &quot;my value&quot;privateprefs save my_other_key &quot;my other key&quot;```###### *run these commands to remove the test data when done*```shprivateprefs delete my_keyprivateprefs delete my_other_key```### Load Value```python from privateprefs import loadmy_value = load(&quot;my_key&quot;)print(my_value)```Return the `value` for the given `key` or `None` if the key doesn't exist.### Load All Values```python from privateprefs import load_keysmy_value_dict = load_keys()my_value = my_value_dict[&quot;my_key&quot;]my_other_value = my_value_dict[&quot;my_other_key&quot;]print(f&quot;My Value: {my_value}&quot;)print(f&quot;My Other Value: {my_other_value}&quot;)```Return all saved key-value pairs as a dictionary ### Load Only Filtered Key Values```python from privateprefs import load_keysfilter_keys = [&quot;my_key&quot;]my_value_dict = load_keys(filter_keys)my_value = my_value_dict[&quot;my_key&quot;]print(f&quot;My Value: {my_value}&quot;)does_my_other_key_exist = 'my_other_key' in my_value_dict.keys()print(f&quot;does_my_other_key_exist: {does_my_other_key_exist}&quot;)```Only returns key-value pairs that are in the `filter_keys` list### Load All Values as List of Tuples```python from privateprefs import load_keysmy_tuple_list = load_keys(return_as_list=True)for my_tuple in my_tuple_list:    print(f&quot;Tuple: {my_tuple}&quot;)    my_key = my_tuple[0]    my_value = my_tuple[1]    print(f&quot;key: {my_key}&quot;)    print(f&quot;value: {my_value} \n&quot;)```Return all saved key-value pairs as a dictionary ### Delete Value```python from privateprefs import deletedelete(&quot;my_key&quot;)```Delete the value for a given key ### Delete All Values###### &lt;sub&gt; *-- WARNING ALL SAVED DATA WILL BE PERMANENTLY DELETED --* &lt;/sub&gt;```python from privateprefs import delete_all# don't run if you have saved data you want to keepdelete_all()```Delete all saved/stored values###### Python Note:Note there are no functions to save values using Python; this is by design, by forcing everyone to save values only using the CLI or editing the data.ini file ensures that hardcoded values will never end up in version control repositories.But never say never. If you dig around in the package core, you can find the save functions, but using the internal Python save functions means hard-coding sensitive data directly in Python and defeating the purpose of this package.## CLI Docs### Help```shprivateprefs -h```Display the potential arguments and options to use.### Save```shprivateprefs save my_key &quot;My Value&quot;```Save a key-value pair to the data.ini file, quotes required if there are spaces in the string.### Load```shprivateprefs load my_key```Load a value for the given key.### Delete```shprivateprefs delete my_key```Delete the value for the given key.### Delete All```shprivateprefs delete_all```Deletes all values.### Data```shprivateprefs data```Display the data.ini file path and its contents as a data table.### Open```shprivateprefs open```Open the data.ini file in the application associated with opening .ini file extension.### Pre-Uninstall```shprivateprefs pre_uninstall```Removes all files and folders created by this package.## License`privateprefs` is distributed under the terms of the [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) license.</longdescription>
