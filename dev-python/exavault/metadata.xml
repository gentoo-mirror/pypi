	<longdescription># ExaVault Python API Library - v2 APIWelcome to ExaVault's Python code library for our v2 API. Use our API to interact with all aspects of the service the same way our web portal would. The library is generated from our API's [public swagger YAML file](https://www.exavault.com/api/docs/evapi_2.0_public.yaml).## Requirements The SDK supports the following versions of Python:-  Python 2 versions 2.7.9 and later-  Python 3 versions 3.4 and laterYou will also need an ExaVault account, as well as an API key and access token.## Installing the Code Library### Option 1 - Using PIPYou can use pip to add this library to your project by running this command in your project folder:```bash% pip install exavault```### Option 2 - Manual InstallationAlternatively, you can:1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/ExaVault/evapi-python.git evapi-python` or manually download the library.2. Run setup script `python setup.py install` Depending on your python setup, you may need to run the script as root; e.g. `sudo python setup.py install`## Sample CodeFor a gentle introduction to using Python code with ExaVault's API, check out [our code samples](https://github.com/ExaVault/evapi-python-samples). Follow the instructions in that repository's README to run the sample scripts, which will demonstrate how to use several of the APIs to interact with your ExaVault account.## Writing Your Own CodeWhen you're ready to write your own code using this library, you'll need to:1. Install our code library in your project, either with `pip install exavault` or by downloading this repository and importing the package directly1. Provide your API key and access token with every function method on the Api classes1. Whenever you instantiate an Api object (ResourcesApi, UsersApi, etc.), override the configuration to point the code at the correct API URL:```pythonfrom exavault import AccountApiACCOUNT_URL = &quot;https://YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE.exavault.com/api/v2/&quot;;account_api = AccountApi()account_api.api_client.configuration.host = ACCOUNT_URL``````pythonfrom exavault import ResourcesApiACCOUNT_URL = &quot;https://YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE.exavault.com/api/v2/&quot;;resources_api = ResourcesApi()resources_api.api_client.configuration.host = ACCOUNT_URL``````pythonfrom exavault import NotificationsApiACCOUNT_URL = &quot;https://YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE.exavault.com/api/v2/&quot;;notifications_api = NotificationsApi()notifications_api.api_client.configuration.host = ACCOUNT_URL```If you'd like to see this done in sample code, please take a look at [our code samples](https://github.com/ExaVault/evapi-python-samples).## Authorsupport@exavault.com</longdescription>
