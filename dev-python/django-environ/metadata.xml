	<longdescription>==============django-environ==============``django-environ`` is the Python package that allows you to use`Twelve-factor methodology &lt;https://www.12factor.net/&gt;`_ to configure yourDjango application with environment variables... -teaser-end-For that, it gives you an easy way to configure Django application usingenvironment variables obtained from an environment file and provided by the OS:.. -code-begin-.. code-block:: python   import environ   import os   env = environ.Env(       # set casting, default value       DEBUG=(bool, False)   )   # Set the project base directory   BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))   # Take environment variables from .env file   environ.Env.read_env(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '.env'))   # False if not in os.environ because of casting above   DEBUG = env('DEBUG')   # Raises Django's ImproperlyConfigured   # exception if SECRET_KEY not in os.environ   SECRET_KEY = env('SECRET_KEY')   # Parse database connection url strings   # like psql://user:pass@127.0.0.1:8458/db   DATABASES = {       # read os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] and raises       # ImproperlyConfigured exception if not found       #       # The db() method is an alias for db_url().       'default': env.db(),       # read os.environ['SQLITE_URL']       'extra': env.db_url(           'SQLITE_URL',           default='sqlite:////tmp/my-tmp-sqlite.db'       )   }   CACHES = {       # Read os.environ['CACHE_URL'] and raises       # ImproperlyConfigured exception if not found.       #       # The cache() method is an alias for cache_url().       'default': env.cache(),       # read os.environ['REDIS_URL']       'redis': env.cache_url('REDIS_URL')   }.. -overview-The idea of this package is to unify a lot of packages that make the same stuff:Take a string from ``os.environ``, parse and cast it to some of useful pythontyped variables. To do that and to use the `12factor &lt;https://www.12factor.net/&gt;`_approach, some connection strings are expressed as url, so this package can parseit and return a ``urllib.parse.ParseResult``. These strings from ``os.environ``are loaded from a ``.env`` file and filled in ``os.environ`` with ``setdefault``method, to avoid to overwrite the real environ.A similar approach is used in `Two Scoops of Django &lt;https://www.feldroy.com/books/two-scoops-of-django-3-x&gt;`_book and explained in `12factor-django &lt;https://wellfire.co/learn/easier-12-factor-django&gt;`_article.Using ``django-environ`` you can stop to make a lot of unversioned``settings_*.py`` to configure your app.See `cookiecutter-django &lt;https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django&gt;`_for a concrete example on using with a django project.**Feature Support**- Fast and easy multi environment for deploy- Fill ``os.environ`` with .env file variables- Variables casting- Url variables exploded to django specific package settings- Optional support for Docker-style file based config variables (use  ``environ.FileAwareEnv`` instead of ``environ.Env``).. -project-information-Project Information===================``django-environ`` is released under the `MIT / X11 License &lt;https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/&gt;`__,its documentation lives at `Read the Docs &lt;https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_,the code on `GitHub &lt;https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ&gt;`_,and the latest release on `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/django-environ/&gt;`_.It’s rigorously tested on Python 3.6+, and officially supportsDjango 1.11, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 4.0, 4.1 and 4.2.If you'd like to contribute to ``django-environ`` you're most welcome!.. -support-Support=======Should you have any question, any remark, or if you find a bug, or if there issomething you can't do with the ``django-environ``, please`open an issue &lt;https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ&gt;`_.Contributing============If you would like to contribute to ``django-environ``, please take a look at the`current issues &lt;https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ/issues&gt;`_.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What isyour environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What OS experience theproblem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will helppeople to fix any potential bugs.Feature requests----------------Feature requests are welcome.

Pleaseprovide as much detail and context as possible.Pull requests-------------Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastichelp. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelatedcommits.Follow this process if you'd like your work considered for inclusion in theproject:1. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a   feature idea or a bug.2. Fork `the repository &lt;https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ&gt;`_   on GitHub to start making your changes to the ``develop`` branch   (or branch off of it).3. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works as   expected.4. Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published.If you are intending to implement a fairly large feature we'd appreciate if youopen an issue with GitHub detailing your use case and intended solution todiscuss how it might impact other work that is in flight.We also appreciate it if you take the time to update and write tests for anychanges you submit.**By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to license yourwork under the same license as that used by the project.**Resources---------* `How to Contribute to Open Source &lt;https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/&gt;`_* `Using Pull Requests &lt;https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests&gt;`_* `Writing good commit messages &lt;https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html&gt;`_Release Information===================v0.11.1 - 30-August-2023---------------------------Fixed+++++- Revert &quot;Add interpolate argument to avoid resolving proxied values.&quot; feature  due to `#485 &lt;https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ/issues/485&gt;`_.`Full changelog &lt;https://django-environ.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changelog.html&gt;`_.Security Policy===============Reporting a Vulnerability-------------------------If you discover a security vulnerability within ``django-environ``, pleasesend an e-mail to Serghei Iakovlev via egrep@protonmail.ch.
