We now have a method tomanually test downstream packages, too.Bug fixes---------* Make sure include dir is found even if the lib is not present in `#974 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/974&gt;`_.Scikit-build 0.17.3===================A small release related to ``PYTHON_LIBRARY`` handling changes in 0.17.2;scikit-build 0.17.3 returns an empty string from ``get_python_library`` if noPython library is present (like on manylinux), where 0.17.2 returned None, andprevious versions returned a non-existent path. Note that adding ``REQUIRED``to ``find_package(PythonLibs`` will fail, but it is incorrect (you must notlink to ``libPython.so``) and was really just injecting a non-existent pathbefore.Bug fixes---------* Keep ``get_python_library``  return type string if python lib non-existing  for now in `#959 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/959&gt;`_.* Avoid 'not found' warning if libs are not found by FindPythonExtensions in `#960 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/960&gt;`_.* FindNumPy should not call FindPythonLibs in `#958 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/958&gt;`_.Scikit-build 0.17.2===================Another small release with fixes for non-MSVC Windows platforms.Bug fixes---------* RPM spec fix by `@LecrisUT &lt;https://github.com/LecrisUT&gt;`_ in `#937 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/937&gt;`_.* Validate value before returning library path by `@dlech &lt;https://github.com/dlech&gt;`_ in `#942 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/942&gt;`_.* Only add ``Python_LIBRARY`` on Windows MSVC in `#943 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/943&gt;`_ and `#944 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/944&gt;`_.* Slightly nicer traceback for failed compiler in `#947 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/947&gt;`_.Testing-------* Hide a few warnings that are expected in `#948 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/948&gt;`_.Scikit-build 0.17.1===================This is a small release fixing a few bugs; the primary one being a change thatwas triggering a bug in older FindPython. The unused variable messages havebeen deactivated to simplify output, as well.Bug fixes---------* Older (&lt;3.24) CMake breaks when lib specified in `#932 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/932&gt;`_.* An error output was missing formatting in `#931 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/931&gt;`_.* Make empty ``CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` a warning (bug in conda-forge's  clang activation fixed upstream) in `#934 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/934&gt;`_.* Remove unused variable warnings by in `#930 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/930&gt;`_.Testing-------* Add Fedora packaging with packit automation by `@LecrisUT &lt;https://github.com/LecrisUT&gt;`_ in `#928 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/928&gt;`_.* Fix codecov ci by `@LecrisUT &lt;https://github.com/LecrisUT&gt;`_ in `#929 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/929&gt;`_.* Update some coverage settings in `#933 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/933&gt;`_.Scikit-build 0.17.0===================A lot of bug fixes are present in this release, focusing on Windows, PyPy, andcross compiling. We've also improved the compatibility with default setuptoolsbehaviors a little, and enabled some things that were previously unavailable,like overriding the build type via the cmake argument environment variables.We've expanded our CI matrix to include Windows and macOS PyPy and some Fortrantests on Linux. This release requires Python 3.7+.Bug fixes---------* Match setuptools behavior for ``include_package_data`` default. by `@vyasr &lt;https://github.com/vyasr&gt;`_ in `#873 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/873&gt;`_.* Misc. fixes for F2PY and PythonExtensions modules by `@benbovy &lt;https://github.com/benbovy&gt;`_ in `#495 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/495&gt;`_.* Provide more useful error if user provides ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` by `@vyasr &lt;https://github.com/vyasr&gt;`_ in `#872 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/872&gt;`_.* Stop assuming that ``.pyx`` files are in the same directory as ``CMakeLists.txt`` by `@vyasr &lt;https://github.com/vyasr&gt;`_ in `#871 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/871&gt;`_.* Allow build type overriding in `#902 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/902&gt;`_.* Detect PyPy library correctly on Windows by user:`gershnik` in `#904 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/904&gt;`_.* Include library for FindPython for better Windows cross-compiles in `#913 &lt;https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/913&gt;`_.

Building Binary Extensions with pybind11, scikit-build, and cibuildwheel. https://doi.org/10.25080/majora-212e5952-033History-------PyCMake was created at SciPy 2014 in response to general difficulties buildingC++ and Fortran based Python extensions across platforms.  It was renamed to&quot;scikit-build&quot; in 2016.Known Issues------------These issues are likely to be addressed in upcoming releases.* Editable installs do not work with the latest versions of Setuptools (and had  issues with older versions, too).* Configuration scikit-build cares about _must_ be specified in ``setup()``  currently.* The cache directory (``_skbuild``) may need to be deleted between builds in  some cases (like rebuilding with a different Python interpreter).We are also working on improving scikit-build, so there are some upcomingchanges and deprecations:* All deprecated setuptools/distutils features are also deprecated in  scikit-build, like the ``test`` command, ``easy_install``, etc.* Older versions of CMake (&lt;3.15) are not recommended; a future version will  remove support for older CMake's (along with providing a better mechanism for  ensuring a proper CMake is available).If you need any of these features, please open or find an issue explaining whatand why you need something.Miscellaneous-------------* Free software: MIT license* Documentation: http://scikit-build.readthedocs.org* Source code: https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build* Discussions: https://github.com/orgs/scikit-build/discussionsSupport for this work was provided by NSF cooperative agreement `OAC-2209877 &lt;https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2209877&gt;`_.</longdescription>
