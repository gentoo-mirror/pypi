	<longdescription>Public Suffix List module for Python====================================Deprecated----------Please don't use this module. It is provided for historical reasons only. Newcode should instead use one of the other libraries that provide similarfunctionality. For example: * publicsuffix2_ * publicsuffixlist_.. _publicsuffix2: https://pypi.org/project/publicsuffix2.. _publicsuffixlist: https://pypi.org/project/publicsuffixlistAbout-----This module allows you to get the public suffix of a domain name using thePublic Suffix List from http://publicsuffix.orgA public suffix is one under which Internet users can directly registernames. Some examples of public suffixes are .com, .co.uk and pvt.k12.wy.us.Accurately knowing the public suffix of a domain is useful when handlingweb browser cookies, highlighting the most important part of a domain namein a user interface or sorting URLs by web site.It's up the user to provide this module with an appropriate version of thePublic Suffix List. A convenience function is provided that downloads the mostrecent version available on http://publicsuffix.orgModule content--------------The `fetch()` function downloads the most recent version of the list andreturns a file object. You should cache the data as appropriate for yourapplication::    &gt;&gt;&gt; from publicsuffix import fetch    &gt;&gt;&gt; psl_file = fetch()Alternatively, if you have the list already downloaded by other means::    &gt;&gt;&gt; import codecs    &gt;&gt;&gt; psl_file = codecs.open('publicsuffix/public_suffix_list.dat', encoding='utf8')The `PublicSuffixList` class parses the Public Suffix List and allows queriesfor individual domain names::    &gt;&gt;&gt; from publicsuffix import PublicSuffixList    &gt;&gt;&gt; psl = PublicSuffixList(psl_file)    &gt;&gt;&gt; psl.get_public_suffix(&quot;www.example.com&quot;)    'example.com'Please note that the ``host`` part of an URL can contain strings that arenot plain DNS domain names (IP addresses, Punycode-encoded names, name incombination with a port number or an username, etc.). It is up to thecaller to ensure only domain names are passed to the get_public_suffix()method.Installation------------To install from the source distribution and run unit tests, use thesecommands::    $ python setup.py install    $ python setup.py testSource------You can get a local copy of the development repository with::    git clone https://www.tablix.org/~avian/git/publicsuffix.gitNotes on backwards compatibility--------------------------------This module ships with an out-dated copy of the Public Suffix List forcompatibility with older versions. Use of this list is deprecated since itencouraged applications that never updated the Public Suffix List data. Thebuilt-in list will be removed in a future version.If you are using the `PublicSuffixList` constructor without any arguments,please use the `fetch()` function and implement an appropriate cache, as shownabove.Support-------See deprecation notice above.
