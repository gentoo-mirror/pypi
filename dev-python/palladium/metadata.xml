It is a **pluggable framework**for developing real-world **machine learning solutions**.  It providesgeneric implementations for things commonly needed in machinelearning, such as dataset loading, model training with parametersearch, a web service, and persistence capabilities, allowing you toconcentrate on the core task of developing an accurate machinelearning model.  Having a well-tested core framework that is used fora number of different services can lead to a reduction of costs duringdevelopment and maintenance due to harmonization of different servicesbeing based on the same code base and identical processes. Palladiumhas a web service overhead of a few milliseconds only, making itpossible to **set up services with low response times**.A **configuration file** lets you conveniently tie together existingcomponents with components that you developed.  As an example, if whatyou want to do is to develop a model where you load a dataset from aCSV file or an SQL database, and train an SVM classifier to predictone of the rows in the data given the others, and then find out aboutyour model's accuracy, then that's what Palladium allows you to do**without writing a single line of code**. However, it is alsopossible to independently integrate own solutions... image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ottogroup/palladium/master/docs/palladium_illustration.png   :width: 700px   :align: center   :alt: Illustration of Palladium|Much of Palladium's functionality is based on the **scikit-learn**library.  Thus, a lot of times you will find yourself looking at the`documentation for scikit-learn &lt;http://scikit-learn.org/&gt;`_ whendeveloping with Palladium.  Although being implemented in Python,Palladium provides support for other languages and is shipped withexamples how to **integrate and expose R and Julia models**.For an efficient deployment of services based on Palladium, a script to**create Docker images automatically** is provided. In order to manageand monitor a number of Palladium service instances in a cluster,**Mesosphere’s Mesos framework Marathon can be used for deployment**,also enabling **scalability by having a variable number of servicenodes behind a load balancer**.  Examples how to create PalladiumDocker images and how to use them with Mesos / Marathon are part ofthe documentation. Other important aspects – especially relevant inenterprise contexts for setting up productive services – like**authentication, logging, or monitoring, can be easily integrated viapluggable decorator lists** in the configuration file of a service,keeping track of service calls and corresponding permissions.Everyone is welcome to contribute to Palladium.
