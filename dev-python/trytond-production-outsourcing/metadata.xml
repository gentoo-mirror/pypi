	<longdescription>Production Outsourcing Module#############################The production outsourcing module allows to outsource production order perrouting. When such outsourced production is set to waiting, a purchase order iscreated and its cost is added to the production.To define an outsourced production, the routing must have a *Supplier*, a*Service* and its *Quantity* defined. Those values will be used to create thepurchase order. The bought quantity is computed by multiplying the *Quantity*by the factor between the bill of material and the production quantity.</longdescription>
