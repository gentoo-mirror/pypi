	<longdescription>***********git-project***********The extensible stupid project managerSetup=====``pip install git-project``Description===========git-project is a git extension to manage development of a project hosted in agit repository.  By itself git-project does almost nothing.  Its functionalityis enhanced by plugins.`git-project-core-plugins&lt;http://www.github.com/greened/git-project-core-plugins&gt;`_ provides a set ofbasic functionality and should almost always be installed alongside git-project.Conventions===========Symlinks identiy projects to the ``git-project`` command.  For example, if``git-fizzbin`` is symlinked to ``git-project``, then ``git fizzbin &lt;command&gt;``will invoke ``git-project`` with ``fizzbin`` as the &quot;active project.&quot;  Toemphasize this, we show git-project commands with a generic ``&lt;project&gt;``identifier::  git &lt;project&gt; --helpDiscussion==========With git-project and its core plugins you can:* Initialize a development environment at clone time (or after clone time)* Manage branches* Manage worktrees* Set and invoke commandsgit-project is intended to make switching between active 'tasks' in a repositorysimple and fast, without losing the progress context of existing tasks.  Forexample the core plugins set up build environments such that switching amongprojects and worktrees does not result in &quot;rebuilding the world.&quot;  Builds can beconfigured to invoke complex commands via a convenient name (e.g. ``git&lt;project&gt; build debug``)Substitution variables======================Commands that allow substitution take a form ``{varname}`` in their configuredtextual representation and substitute it with the value of ``varname``.``varname`` can be any configured value under ``&lt;project&gt;``, for example::    [project]        myvar = value``git-project`` has several built-in substitution variables that variouscommands and plugins can use:``branch``    The name of the currently checked-out branch``gitdir``    The value of ``GITDIR````git_common_dir``    The value of ``GIT_COMMON_DIR````project``    The value of ``&lt;project&gt;``</longdescription>
