When you create a project, data are imported into an sqlite database that cutevariant queries according your needs. Presently, SnpEff and VEP annotations are supported. Once your project is created, you can query variant using different gui controller or directly using the VQL language. This Domain Specific Language is specially designed for cutevariant and try to keep the same syntax than SQL for an easy use.![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/labsquare/cutevariant/master/screencast.gif)| | | ||:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:||&lt;img width=&quot;1604&quot; alt=&quot;screen shot 2017-08-07 at 12 18 15 pm&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/labsquare/cutevariant/master/screenshot1.png&quot;&gt; |&lt;img width=&quot;1604&quot; alt=&quot;screen shot 2017-08-07 at 12 18 15 pm&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/labsquare/cutevariant/master/screenshot2.png&quot;&gt;|&lt;img width=&quot;1604&quot; alt=&quot;screen shot 2017-08-07 at 12 18 15 pm&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/labsquare/cutevariant/master/screenshot4.png&quot;&gt;|# Installation## Windows Standalone binary are available for windows:  - [Download cutevariant 32 bit](https://github.com/labsquare/cutevariant/releases/latest/download/cutevariant-standalone-x86.zip)- [Download cutevariant 64 bit](https://github.com/labsquare/cutevariant/releases/latest/download/cutevariant-standalone-x64.zip)## LinuxIf you run Linux, then you can either use PyPI or install from source.But before you proceed to installation, make sure that running this command:```bashsqlite3 --version```returns at least `3.32`.If not, run:```bash# Uninstall previous versions of sqlite3 (to avoid conflicts)sudo apt remove sqlite3# Download latest sqlite versionwget https://www.sqlite.org/2022/sqlite-autoconf-3380500.tar.gz# Extract ittar -xvf sqlite-autoconf-3380500.tar.gzcd sqlite-autoconf-3380500./configure# Run make to buildmake# Run make install, this will put the shared object in /usr/local/libsudo make install# Then add LD_LIBRARY_PATH to your bash profile (either ~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, or whatever is your favorite)echo &quot;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc# Source your shell profile so you don't have to restart itsource ~/.zshrc#Now just to be sure:sqlite3 --version# You should see 3.38 now. If not, this means that the installation went wrong.# That's it! Now you can install cutevariant, either from PyPI or directly from source```## PyPiCutevariant is avaible from [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/cutevariant/) :     pip install cutevariant # install    python -m cutevariant   # run## From source - Python 3.7 or newer is required  ```bash# Clone repositorygit clone https://github.com/labsquare/cutevariant.gitcd cutevariant# Create a virtual environementpython3 -m virtualenv venv source venv/bin/activate# Install cutevariant in local modepython -m pip install -e # Run cutevariant as module python -m cutevariant # or `make run`# Run test python -m pytest tests```## Usages You can follow this tutorial to familiarize yourself with cutevarant.       https://github.com/labsquare/cutevariant/wiki/Usage-examplesThe VQL langage specification is available here :      https://github.com/labsquare/cutevariant/wiki/VQL-language## Contributions / BugsCutevariant is a new project and all contributors are welcome### IssuesIf you found a bug or have a feature request, you can report it from the [Github isse trackers](https://github.com/labsquare/cutevariant/issues).### Create a pluginDocumentation to create a plugin is [available here](https://github.com/labsquare/cutevariant/wiki/Plugins)### Chat You can join us [on discord](https://discord.gg/7sSH4VSPKK).
