It's designed to be intuitive, easy to use, but give great visibily in how we call openai.### RequirementsThis library depends on **Pydantic** and **OpenAI** that's all.### InstallationTo get started with OpenAI Function Call, you need to install it using `pip`. Run the following command in your terminal:```sh$ pip install instructor```## Quick Start with Patching ChatCompletionTo simplify your work with OpenAI models and streamline the extraction of Pydantic objects from prompts, we offer a patching mechanism for the `ChatCompletion`` class. Here's a step-by-step guide:### Step 1: Import and Patch the ModuleFirst, import the required libraries and apply the patch function to the OpenAI module. This exposes new functionality with the response_model parameter.```pythonimport openaifrom pydantic import BaseModelfrom instructor import patchpatch()```### Step 2: Define the Pydantic ModelCreate a Pydantic model to define the structure of the data you want to extract. This model will map directly to the information in the prompt.```pythonclass UserDetail(BaseModel):    name: str    age: int```### Step 3: Extract Data with ChatCompletionUse the openai.ChatCompletion.create method to send a prompt and extract the data into the Pydantic object. The response_model parameter specifies the Pydantic model to use for extraction.```pythonuser: UserDetail = openai.ChatCompletion.create(    model=&quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;,    response_model=UserDetail,    messages=[        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Extract Jason is 25 years old&quot;},    ])```### Step 4: Validate the Extracted DataYou can then validate the extracted data by asserting the expected values. By adding the type things you also get a bunch of nice benefits with your IDE like spell check and auto complete!```pythonassert user.name == &quot;Jason&quot;assert user.age == 25```## Introduction to `OpenAISchema`If you want more control than just passing a single class we can use the `OpenAISchema` which extends `BaseModel`.This quick start guide contains the follow sections:1. Defining a schema 2. Adding Additional Prompting3. Calling the ChatCompletion4. Deserializing back to the instanceOpenAI Function Call allows you to leverage OpenAI's powerful language models for function calls and schema extraction. This guide provides a quick start for using OpenAI Function Call.### Section 1: Defining a SchemaTo begin, let's define a schema using OpenAI Function Call. A schema describes the structure of the input and output data for a function. In this example, we'll define a simple schema for a `User` object:```pythonfrom instructor import OpenAISchemaclass UserDetails(OpenAISchema):    name: str    age: int```In this schema, we define a `UserDetails` class that extends `OpenAISchema`. We declare two fields, `name` and `age`, of type `str` and `int` respectively. ### Section 2: Adding Additional PromptingTo enhance the performance of the OpenAI language model, you can add additional prompting in the form of docstrings and field descriptions. They can provide context and guide the model on how to process the data.!!! note Using `patch`    these docstrings and fields descriptions are powered by `pydantic.BaseModel` so they'll work via the patching approach as well.```python hl_lines=&quot;5 6&quot;from instructor import OpenAISchemafrom pydantic import Fieldclass UserDetails(OpenAISchema):    &quot;Correctly extracted user information&quot;    name: str = Field(..., description=&quot;User's full name&quot;)    age: int```In this updated schema, we use the `Field` class from `pydantic` to add descriptions to the `name` field. The description provides information about the field, giving even more context to the language model.!!! note &quot;Code, schema, and prompt&quot;     We can run `openai_schema` to see exactly what the API will see, notice how the docstrings, attributes, types, and field descriptions are now part of the schema. This describes on this library's core philosophies.```python hl_lines=&quot;2 3&quot;class UserDetails(OpenAISchema):    &quot;Correctly extracted user information&quot;    name: str = Field(..., description=&quot;User's full name&quot;)    age: intUserDetails.openai_schema``````json{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;UserDetails&quot;,&quot;description&quot;: &quot;Correctly extracted user information&quot;,&quot;parameters&quot;: {    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,    &quot;properties&quot;: {    &quot;name&quot;: {        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;User's full name&quot;,        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;    },    &quot;age&quot;: {        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;integer&quot;    }    },    &quot;required&quot;: [    &quot;age&quot;,    &quot;name&quot;    ]}}```### Section 3: Calling the ChatCompletionWith the schema defined, let's proceed with calling the `ChatCompletion` API using the defined schema and messages.```python hl_lines=&quot;11 12 15&quot;from instructor import OpenAISchemafrom pydantic import Fieldclass UserDetails(OpenAISchema):    &quot;Correctly extracted user information&quot;    name: str = Field(..., description=&quot;User's full name&quot;)    age: intcompletion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(    model=&quot;gpt-3.5-turbo-0613&quot;,    functions=[UserDetails.openai_schema],    function_call={&quot;name&quot;: UserDetails.openai_schema[&quot;name&quot;]},    messages=[        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Extract user details from my requests&quot;},        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;My name is John Doe and I'm 30 years old.&quot;},    ],)```In this example, we make a call to the `ChatCompletion` API by providing the model name (`gpt-3.5-turbo-0613`) and a list of messages. The messages consist of a system message and a user message. The system message sets the context by requesting user details, while the user message provides the input with the user's name and age.Note that we have omitted the additional parameters that can be included in the API request, such as `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and `n`. These parameters can be customized according to your requirements.### Section 4: Deserializing Back to the InstanceTo deserialize the response from the `ChatCompletion` API back into an instance of the `UserDetails` class, we can use the `from_response` method.```python hl_lines=&quot;1&quot;user = UserDetails.from_response(completion)print(user.name)  # Output: John Doeprint(user.age)   # Output: 30```By calling `UserDetails.from_response`, we create an instance of the `UserDetails` class using the response from the API call. Subsequently, we can access the extracted user details through the `name` and `age` attributes of the `user` object.## IDE Support Everything is designed for you to get the best developer experience possible, with the best editor support.Including **autocompletion**:![autocomplete](docs/img/ide_support.png)And even **inline errors**![errors](docs/img/error2.png)## OpenAI Schema and PydanticThis quick start guide provided you with a basic understanding of how to use OpenAI Function Call for schema extraction and function calls. You can now explore more advanced use cases and creative applications of this library.Since `UserDetails` is a `OpenAISchems` and a `pydantic.BaseModel` you can use inheritance and nesting to create more complex emails while avoiding code duplication```pythonclass UserDetails(OpenAISchema):    name: str = Field(..., description=&quot;User's full name&quot;)    age: intclass UserWithAddress(UserDetails):    address: str class UserWithFriends(UserDetails):    best_friend: UserDetails    friends: List[UserDetails]```If you have any questions, feel free to leave an issue or reach out to the library's author on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jxnlco).
