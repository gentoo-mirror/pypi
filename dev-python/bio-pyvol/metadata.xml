	<longdescription>PyVOL: Protein Pocket Visualization, Segmentation, and Characterization=======================================================================![image](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/bio_pyvol.svg) ![image](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/bio_pyvol.svg)See the [Full Project Documentation](https://schlessingerlab.github.io/pyvol/).![image](docs/source/_static/overview_image_v01.png)Overview========PyVOL is a python library packaged into a [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/)GUI for identifying protein binding pockets, partitioning them intosub-pockets, and calculating their volumes. PyVOL can be run as a PyMOLplugin through its GUI or the PyMOL prompt, as an imported pythonlibrary, or as a command-line program. Visualization of results isexclusively supported through PyMOL though exported surfaces arecompatible with standard 3D geometry visualization programs. The projectis hosted on github by the Schlessinger Lab. Please access therepository to view code or submit bugs. The package has been mostextensively tested with PyMOL 2.3+ running Python 3.7. Support for allpython versions 2.7+ is intended but not as thoroughly tested. Supportfor PyMOL 1.7.4+ without the GUI is as yet incomplete. Unfortunately,PyVOL can not currently run on MacOS Catalina due to its restrictions onrunning 32-bit executables. The Mac-compatible MSMS executable is notyet available in a 64-bit form.Quick Installation into PyMOL 2.0+==================================PyVOL can be installed into any python environment, but installingdirectly into PyMOL 2.0+ is easiest. Download the[basic GUI installer](https://github.com/schlessingerlab/pyvol/blob/master/installers/pyvol-installer.zip);and then use the PyMOL plugin manager to install that file:Plugins --&amp;gt; Plugin Manager --&amp;gt; Install New Plugin --&amp;gt; Install from local file --&amp;gt;Choose file...This installs the PyVOL GUI. SelectPlugins --&amp;gt; PyVOL --&amp;gt; Settings --&amp;gt; Install PyVOL from PyPI tofetch PyVOL and any missing dependencies. Once PyVOL has been installed,the location of MSMS must be added to the path. In the MSMS Settingspanel, common locations for the executable can be searched. Once anexecutable has been identified and is displayed, Change MSMS Path can beclicked to make that executable visible to the back-end. The GUI shouldthen display that it can find MSMS. For academic users and non-academicusers with the Schrodinger incentive PyMOL distribution, installation isnow complete. For all others see the full [installation documentation](https://schlessingerlab.github.io/pyvol/install.html).Example Basic Run=================A simple calculation using the PyMOL prompt is to load a protein ofinterest and then run the pocket command. This is an example for theSorafenib-bound structure of BRAF:``` {.sourceCode .python}fetch '1uwh'pocket protein=&quot;1uwh and chain B&quot;```</longdescription>
