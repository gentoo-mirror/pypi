	<longdescription>Pinax Theme Bootstrap==================================.. image:: http://slack.pinaxproject.com/badge.svg   :target: http://slack.pinaxproject.com/Pinax-------Pinax is an open-source platform built on the Django Web Framework. It is an ecosystem of reusable Django apps, themes, and starter project templates. This collection can be found at http://pinaxproject.com.pinax-theme-bootstrap----------------------``pinax-theme-bootstrap`` is a theme for Pinax based on the open source Bootstrap front-end framework andthe Font Awesome icon library.Getting Started-----------------Include ``pinax-theme-bootstrap`` in your requirements file and include``pinax_theme_bootstrap`` and ``bootstrapform`` (which is installed alongsidethis theme) in your ``INSTALLED APPS``.Add ``django.core.context_processors.request`` and``pinax_theme_bootstrap.context_processors.theme`` to your ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``to ensure the user selector and site name work correctly.Make sure both template loaders and staticfiles finders includesapp directories.Site name comes from Sites fixture.Your ``site_base.html`` should extend ``theme_bootstrap/base.html`` and should provide``footer`` and ``nav`` blocks (the latter should just be a ul of li of a links).Your pages should have blocks ``head_title`` and ``body`` and should extend``site_base.html``.The url name ``home`` should be defined as the homepage.Dependencies------------* Bootstrap* Font Awesome* jQueryWe previously vendored these packages and had an undocumented build processpre-configured in our starter projects that use this theme. This has gone theway of the 80s hair band and we are now using proper packaging in the starterprojects.The templates in this project are currently tested with the following versions:* Bootstrap 3.3.5* Font Awesome 4.4.0* jQuery 2.1.4If you are not using one of our starter projects, you will need to go aboutsetting up a build environment to use these libraries. We recommend using`webpack &lt;http://webpack.github.io/&gt;`_ and installing these libraries with``npm``.Upgrade Notes-------------Upgrading to 6.0, you should be aware of a few changes:* ``style_base`` and ``extra_style`` blocks have been merged into ``styles``* ``script_base`` and ``extra_script`` blocks have been merged into ``scripts`` and  the ``theme.js`` script is now loaded within a ``theme_script`` block after the  ``scripts`` block. It now expects that you'll load the necessary ``jQuery``  library at the project level in the ``scripts`` block.* No vendored assets ship with the theme anymore. You are responsible for  setting up your own static assets at the project level. We have made it easy  by just using one of our starter projects.Documentation--------------The ``pinax-theme-bootstrap`` documentation is currently under construction.
