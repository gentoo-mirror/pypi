For more information, please see the `documentation &lt;https://the-walrus.readthedocs.io&gt;`_.Features========* Fast calculation of hafnians, loop hafnians, and torontonians of general and certain structured matrices.* An easy to use interface to use the loop hafnian for Gaussian quantum state calculations.* Sampling algorithms for hafnian and torontonians of graphs.* Efficient classical methods for approximating the hafnian of non-negative matrices.* Easy to use implementations of the multidimensional Hermite polynomials, which can also be used to calculate hafnians of all reductions of a given matrix.Installation============The Walrus requires Python version 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10. Installation of The Walrus, aswell as all dependencies, can be done using pip:.. code-block:: bash    pip install thewalrusCompiling from source=====================The Walrus has the following dependencies:* `Python &lt;http://python.org/&gt;`_ &gt;= 3.7* `NumPy &lt;http://numpy.org/&gt;`_  &gt;= 1.19.2* `Numba &lt;https://numba.pydata.org/&gt;`_ &gt;= 0.49.1* `SciPy &lt;https://scipy.org/&gt;`_ &gt;=1.2.1* `SymPy &lt;https://www.sympy.org/&gt;`_ &gt;=1.5.1* `Dask[delayed] &lt;https://docs.dask.org/&gt;`_You can compile the latest development version by cloning the git repository, and installing usingpip in development mode... code-block:: console    $ git clone https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus.git    $ cd thewalrus &amp;&amp; python -m pip install -e .Software tests==============To ensure that The Walrus library is working correctly after installation, the testsuite can be run locally using pytest.Additional packages are required to run the tests. These dependencies can be found in``requirements-dev.txt`` and can be installed using ``pip``:.. code-block:: console    $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txtTo run the tests, navigate to the source code folder and run the command.. code-block:: console    $ make testDocumentation=============The Walrus documentation is available online on `Read the Docs &lt;https://the-walrus.readthedocs.io&gt;`_.Additional packages are required to build the documentation locally as specified in ``doc/requirements.txt``.These packages can be installed using:.. code-block:: console    $ sudo apt install pandoc    $ pip install -r docs/requirements.txtTo build the HTML documentation, go to the top-level directory and run the command.. code-block:: console    $ make docThe documentation can then be found in the ``docs/_build/html/`` directory.Contributing to The Walrus==========================We welcome contributions - simply fork The Walrus repository, and then make a pull request containing your contribution. All contributors to The Walrus will be listed as authors on the releases.We also encourage bug reports, suggestions for new features and enhancements, and even links to projects, applications or scientific publications that use The Walrus.Authors=======The Walrus is the work of `many contributors &lt;https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/blob/master/.github/ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md&gt;`_.If you are doing research using The Walrus, please cite `our paper &lt;https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01705&gt;`_: Brajesh Gupt, Josh Izaac and Nicolas Quesada.
