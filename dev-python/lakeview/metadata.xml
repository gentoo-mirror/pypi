	<longdescription>![Lakeview logo](https://jzhang-dev.github.io/lakeview/_images/logo.svg)# Lakeview[![pytest](https://github.com/jzhang-dev/lakeview/actions/workflows/run_pytest.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jzhang-dev/lakeview/actions/workflows/run_pytest.yml)[![mypy](https://github.com/jzhang-dev/lakeview/actions/workflows/type_check_with_mypy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jzhang-dev/lakeview/actions/workflows/type_check_with_mypy.yml)Lakeview is a Python 3 library for creating publication-quality [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/)-style genomic visualizations. Lakeview is based on [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). A quick example:```py# Import Lakeviewimport lakeview as lv# Load aligned segments in a selected region from a BAM filepainter = lv.SequenceAlignment.from_file(    &quot;PacBio_HiFi.bam&quot;, region=&quot;chr14:105,660,000-105,780,000&quot;)# Create an empty GenomeViewer with two tracksgv = lv.GenomeViewer(tracks=2, figsize=(8, 5), height_ratios=(1, 4))# Plot alignment pileuppainter.draw_pileup(    gv.axes[0],             # Plot on the first track of the GenomeViewer    show_mismatches=False,  # Do not highlight mismatched bases)# Plot aligned segmentspainter.draw_alignment(    gv.axes[1],             # Plot on the second track of the GenomeViewer    show_mismatches=False,  # Do not highlight mismatched bases    sort_by=&quot;length&quot;,       # Plot longer reads first    link_by=&quot;name&quot;,         # Link primary and supplementary alignments of the same read    max_rows=30,            # Only show the first 30 alignment rows)# Adjust x axis limitsgv.set_xlim(105_670_000, 105_777_000)# Save the plotgv.savefig(&quot;example.png&quot;)```![example.png](https://jzhang-dev.github.io/lakeview/_images/readme_demo.png)Lakeview currently supports visualzing sequence alignment, pileup, and gene annotation tracks. Additional functionality will be added in the future. Try Lakeview interactively with Binder:[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jzhang-dev/lakeview/HEAD?labpath=docs%2Ftutorials%2Fquick_start.ipynb) ## Features- **Improved clarity**. Lakeview inherits the familiar and intuitive visual style of [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/), with a clear layout designed for publication and presentation. - **Programmable plotting**. Multiple files and genomic regions can be visualized automatically through a Pythonic interface inspired by [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).- **Support for remote data**. Genomic data are often stored in remote servers without display devices. With Lakeview, you can plot remotely and view the output figures locally. Lakeview works well with [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to streamline this workflow. - **Transparency and reproducibility**. Figures are plotted transparently and annotated explicitly. The input data and the plotting code contain all the information needed to reproduce the figure. - **Customizable layouts**. Lakeview supports many layouts implemented in [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/), while allowing the user to define custom rules for ordering, grouping, and coloring each segment. Advanced customization is possible via the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) API.- **Interactive plotting**. Lakeview ships with an interactive [Jupyter Widget](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to help users locate their regions of interest.## Installation```shpip install lakeview```## DocumentationLakeview documentation is available at https://jzhang-dev.github.io/lakeview/.## ContributeIssues and pull requests are welcome via [GitHub](https://github.com/jzhang-dev/lakeview/).A ready-to-use development environment is available via Gitpod:[![Contribute with Gitpod](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contribute%20with-Gitpod-908a85?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jzhang-dev/lakeview)## LicenseLakeview is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license. </longdescription>
