	<longdescription>sphinx-asdf===========.. image:: https://github.com/asdf-format/sphinx-asdf/workflows/CI/badge.svg    :target: https://github.com/asdf-format/sphinx-asdf/actions    :alt: CI Status``sphinx-asdf`` is a plugin for `sphinx`_ that enables generation ofdocumentation from `ASDF`_ schemas.Installation------------To install the latest release on PyPI::    $ pip install sphinx-asdfThe latest development version is available from the ``master`` branch `ongithub`_. To clone the project:::    $ git clone https://github.com/asdf-format/sphinx-asdfTo install:::    $ cd sphinx-asdf    $ pip install .To install in `development mode`_::    $ pip install -e .Usage-----The ``sphinx-asdf`` plugin provides two `sphinx directives`_,``asdf-autoschemas`` and ``asdf-schema``.The plugin also provides several configuration variables:* ``asdf_schema_path``* ``asdf_schema_standard_prefix``* ``asdf_schema_reference_mappings``Basic Example*************Consider a package with the following layout as an example::   mypackage/      setup.py      mypackage/         schemas/            example.org/               custom/                  foo/                     a.yaml                     b.yaml                     c.yaml                  bar/                     x.yaml                     y.yaml                     z.yaml         ...      docs/         conf.py         schemas.rstThis package provides schemas with tags that all have the prefix of``tag:example.org/custom``. The layout of the schema directory reflects thisnaming convention. We wish to provide documentation for all of our schemas.First, we will add configuration variables to our ``docs/conf.py`` file:.. code-block:: python   # This variable indicates the top-level directory containing schemas.   # The path is relative to the location of conf.py in the package   asdf_schema_path = &quot;../mypackage/schemas&quot;   # This variable indicates the standard prefix that is common to all schemas   # provided by the package.   asdf_schema_standard_prefix = &quot;example.org/custom&quot;The variables set in the ``docs/conf.py`` file indicate to ``sphinx-asdf``where to locate the schemas based on the names we will use in thedocumentation.Now, we use the ``asdf-autoschemas`` directive in ``docs/schemas.rst`` tocreate a table of contents for the schema documentation::   .. asdf-autoschemas::      foo/a      foo/b      foo/c      bar/x      bar/y      bar/zEach item in the list represents the name of a schema to be included in thedocuments. The names are **not** paths to the schema files and should notinclude the file extension. Resolution of the names to actual schema files ishandled by the ``asdf_schema_path`` and ``asdf_schema_standard_prefix``configuration variables.We can also use multiple ``asdf-autoschemas`` directives if we wish::   These schemas are part of foo:   .. asdf-autoschemas::      foo/a      foo/b      foo/c   And these schemas are part of bar:   .. asdf-autoschemas::      bar/x      bar/y      bar/zWhen ``sphinx-build`` runs, the ``sphinx-asdf`` plugin will automaticallygenerate schema documentation for each of the schemas listed in each``asdf-autoschemas`` directive. In the documentation, each ``asdf-autoschemas``directive will be replaced with a table of contents that contains links to eachof the listed schema documents... _Directive settings:Directive settings******************While the ``asdf_schema_path`` and ``asdf_schema_standard_prefix``configuration variables set global schema resolution settings, it is alsopossible to set per-directive settings. For example, we could have done thefollowing::   .. asdf-autoschemas::      :schema_root: ../mypackage/schemas      :standard_prefix: example.org/customThis would eliminate the need to set global settings. It also allows anyglobal settings to be overridden on a per-directive basis... note::   The ``:schema_root:`` argument requires a path that is relative to   the ``sphinx`` configuration file.External References*******************Schema references to other schemas in the same package are automaticallyconverted to links in the generated documentation. (This assumes that all ofthe references correspond to schemas that are explicitly generated by an``asdf-autoschemas`` directive). However, sometimes it is necessary to resolvereferences to schemas in other packages. The ``asdf_schema_reference_mapping``configuration variable is provided for this purpose. It enables a mappingbetween references that begin with a particular prefix to a URL indicatinganother package's documentation.For example, to enable references to the ASDF Standard documentation to beresolved as links, include the following in your ``docs/conf.py`` file:.. code-block:: python   asdf_schema_reference_mappings = [       ('tag:stsci.edu:asdf',        'http://asdf-standard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/stsci.edu/asdf/'),   ]Inline documentation********************The ``asdf-autoschemas`` directive automatically generates individual schemadocumentation pages and creates a table of contents. However, sometimes it maybe useful to include schema documentation inline inside another document. The``asdf-schema`` directive is provided for this purpose.Using the package described above as an example, the ``asdf-schema`` directivecan be used to document a single schema inside of another document::   .. asdf-schema::      foo/aThe behavior of the ``asdf-schema`` directive is also governed by the``asdf_schema_path`` and ``asdf_schema_standard_prefix`` global configurationvariables. The directive also accepts the same ``:schema_root:`` and``:standard_prefix:`` arguments as ``asdf-autoschemas`` (see `Directivesettings`_ above) for per-directive configuration.Contributing------------We welcome feedback and contributions to the project.
