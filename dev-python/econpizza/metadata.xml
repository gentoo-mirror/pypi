Steady state and nonlinear impulse responses (including, e.g., the ELB) can typically be found within a few seconds.The method extends the `Sequence-Space Jacobian &lt;https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian&gt;`_ method (`Auclert et al., 2022, ECMA &lt;https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA17434&gt;`_) to fully nonlinear heterogeneous agent models models by iteratively using `Jacobian-vector producs &lt;https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html#how-it-s-made-two-foundational-autodiff-functions&gt;`_ to approximate the solution to the linear system of equations associated with each Newton iteration. This not only allows to study the dynamics of aggregate variables, but also the complete nonlinear transition dynamics of the cross-sectional distribution of assets and disaggregated objects.To solve models with representative agents a shooting methods similar to Laffargue (1990), Boucekkine (1995) and Juillard (1996) is implemented. It is faster and more reliable than the extended path method in dynare due to the use of automatic differentiation for the efficient jacobian decompositions during each Newton-step. Nonlinear perfect-foresight transition dynamics can - even for large-scale nonlinear models with several occassionally binding constraints - be computed in less than a second.The package builds heavily on `automatic differentiation &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation&gt;`_ via `JAX &lt;https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html&gt;`_.Documentation-------------Guides and tutorials are provided on ReadTheDocs: * `Installation &lt;https://econpizza.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/installation.html&gt;`_ * `User guide &lt;https://econpizza.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html&gt;`_ * `Quickstart tutorial &lt;https://econpizza.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/quickstart.html&gt;`_Citation--------.. code-block:: bibtex    @article{boehl2023goodpizza,        title       = {HANK on Speed: Robust Nonlinear Solutions using Automatic Differentiation},        author      = {Boehl, Gregor},        journal     = {Available at SSRN 4433585},        year        = {2023}    }</longdescription>
