	<longdescription># sinfo**Note the new name**&gt; The `sinfo` package has changed name and is now called `session_info`&gt; to become more discoverable and self-explanatory.&gt; The `sinfo` PyPI package will be kept around to avoid breaking old installs&gt; and you can downgrade to 0.3.2 if you want to use it without seeing this message.&gt; For the latest features and bug fixes,&gt; please install `session_info` instead.&gt; The usage and defaults also changed slightly,&gt; so please review the latest README at https://gitlab.com/joelostblom/session_info.`sinfo` outputs version information for modules loaded in the current session,Python, the OS, and the CPU. It is designed as a minimum measure to increasereproducibility and provides similar information as `sessionInfo` in R. Thename is shortened to encourage regular usage through reduced typing =)## Motivation`sinfo` is particularly useful when conducting exploratory data analysis inJupyter notebooks. Listing the version numbers of all loaded modules afterimporting them is a simple way to ensure a minimum level of reproducibilitywhile requiring little additional effort. This practice is useful both whenrevisiting notebooks and when sharing them with colleagues. `sinfo` is meant tocomplement more robust practices such as frozen virtual environments,containers, and binder.## Installation`sinfo` can be installed via `pip install sinfo`. It does not depend on a packagemanager to find version numbers since it fetches them from the module's versionstring. Its only dependency is `stdlib_list`, which is used to distinguishbetween standard library and third party modules.## Usage```pythonimport mathimport natsortimport numpyimport pandasfrom sinfo import sinfosinfo()```Output:```-----natsort     5.3.3numpy       1.17.3pandas      0.25.1sinfo       0.3.0-----Python 3.7.3 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Dec  6 2019, 08:54:18) [GCC 7.3.0]Linux-5.4.2-arch1-1-x86_64-with-arch4 logical CPU cores-----Session information updated at 2019-12-14 16:14```The default behavior is to only output modules not in the standard library,which is why the `math` module is omitted above (it can be included byspecifying `std_lib=True`). To include not only the explicitly importedmodules, but also any dependencies they import internally, specify `dependencies=True`.The notebook output is concealed in `&lt;details&gt;` tags by default to not take up too much visual real estate.When called from a notebook, `sinfo` writes the module dependenciesto a file called to `&lt;notebook_name&gt;-requirements.txt`, which is compatible with `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`.See the docstring for complete parameter info.## Background`sinfo` started as minor modifications of `py_session`, and as it grew itbecame convenient to create a new package. `sinfo` was built with the help ofinformation provided in stackoverflow answers and existing similar packages,including- https://github.com/fbrundu/py_session- https://github.com/jrjohansson/version_information- https://stackoverflow.com/a/4858123/2166823- https://stackoverflow.com/a/40690954/2166823- https://stackoverflow.com/a/52187331/2166823</longdescription>
