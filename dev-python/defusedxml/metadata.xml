An attacker can also keepCPUs busy for a long time with a small to medium size request. Under somecircumstances it is even possible to access local files on yourserver, to circumvent a firewall, or to abuse services to rebound attacks tothird parties.The attacks use and abuse less common features of XML and its parsers. Themajority of developers are unacquainted with features such as processinginstructions and entity expansions that XML inherited from SGML. At bestthey know about ``&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;`` from experience with HTML but they are notaware that a document type definition (DTD) can generate an HTTP requestor load a file from the file system.None of the issues is new. They have been known for a long time. Billionlaughs was first reported in 2003. Nevertheless some XML libraries andapplications are still vulnerable and even heavy users of XML aresurprised by these features. It's hard to say whom to blame for thesituation. It's too short sighted to shift all blame on XML parsers andXML libraries for using insecure default settings. After all theyproperly implement XML specifications. Application developers must not relythat a library is always configured for security and potential harmful databy default... contents:: Table of Contents   :depth: 2Attack vectors==============billion laughs / exponential entity expansion---------------------------------------------The `Billion Laughs`_ attack -- also known as exponential entity expansion --uses multiple levels of nested entities. The original example uses 9 levelsof 10 expansions in each level to expand the string ``lol`` to a string of3 * 10 :sup:`9` bytes, hence the name &quot;billion laughs&quot;. The resulting stringoccupies 3 GB (2.79 GiB) of memory; intermediate strings require additionalmemory. Because most parsers don't cache the intermediate step for everyexpansion it is repeated over and over again. It increases the CPU load evenmore.An XML document of just a few hundred bytes can disrupt all services on amachine within seconds.Example XML::    &lt;!DOCTYPE xmlbomb [    &lt;!ENTITY a &quot;1234567890&quot; &gt;    &lt;!ENTITY b &quot;&amp;a;&amp;a;&amp;a;&amp;a;&amp;a;&amp;a;&amp;a;&amp;a;&quot;&gt;    &lt;!ENTITY c &quot;&amp;b;&amp;b;&amp;b;&amp;b;&amp;b;&amp;b;&amp;b;&amp;b;&quot;&gt;    &lt;!ENTITY d &quot;&amp;c;&amp;c;&amp;c;&amp;c;&amp;c;&amp;c;&amp;c;&amp;c;&quot;&gt;    ]&gt;    &lt;bomb&gt;&amp;d;&lt;/bomb&gt;quadratic blowup entity expansion---------------------------------A quadratic blowup attack is similar to a `Billion Laughs`_ attack; it abusesentity expansion, too. Instead of nested entities it repeats one large entitywith a couple of thousand chars over and over again. The attack isn't asefficient as the exponential case but it avoids triggering countermeasures ofparsers against heavily nested entities. Some parsers limit the depth andbreadth of a single entity but not the total amount of expanded textthroughout an entire XML document.A medium-sized XML document with a couple of hundred kilobytes can require acouple of hundred MB to several GB of memory. When the attack is combinedwith some level of nested expansion an attacker is able to achieve a higherratio of success.::    &lt;!DOCTYPE bomb [    &lt;!ENTITY a &quot;xxxxxxx... a couple of ten thousand chars&quot;&gt;    ]&gt;    &lt;bomb&gt;&amp;a;&amp;a;&amp;a;... repeat&lt;/bomb&gt;external entity expansion (remote)----------------------------------Entity declarations can contain more than just text for replacement. They canalso point to external resources by public identifiers or system identifiers.System identifiers are standard URIs. When the URI is a URL (e.g. a``http://`` locator) some parsers download the resource from the remotelocation and embed them into the XML document verbatim.Simple example of a parsed external entity::    &lt;!DOCTYPE external [    &lt;!ENTITY ee SYSTEM &quot;http://www.python.org/some.xml&quot;&gt;    ]&gt;    &lt;root&gt;&amp;ee;&lt;/root&gt;The case of parsed external entities works only for valid XML content. TheXML standard also supports unparsed external entities with a``NData declaration``.External entity expansion opens the door to plenty of exploits. An attackercan abuse a vulnerable XML library and application to rebound and forwardnetwork requests with the IP address of the server. It highly dependson the parser and the application what kind of exploit is possible. Forexample:* An attacker can circumvent firewalls and gain access to restricted  resources as all the requests are made from an internal and trustworthy  IP address, not from the outside.* An attacker can abuse a service to attack, spy on or DoS your servers but  also third party services. The attack is disguised with the IP address of  the server and the attacker is able to utilize the high bandwidth of a big  machine.* An attacker can exhaust additional resources on the machine, e.g. with  requests to a service that doesn't respond or responds with very large  files.* An attacker may gain knowledge, when, how often and from which IP address  an XML document is accessed.* An attacker could send mail from inside your network if the URL handler  supports ``smtp://`` URIs.external entity expansion (local file)--------------------------------------External entities with references to local files are a sub-case of externalentity expansion. It's listed as an extra attack because it deserves extraattention. Some XML libraries such as lxml disable network access by defaultbut still allow entity expansion with local file access by default. Localfiles are either referenced with a ``file://`` URL or by a file path (eitherrelative or absolute).An attacker may be able to access and download all files that can be read bythe application process. This may include critical configuration files, too.::    &lt;!DOCTYPE external [    &lt;!ENTITY ee SYSTEM &quot;file:///PATH/TO/simple.xml&quot;&gt;    ]&gt;    &lt;root&gt;&amp;ee;&lt;/root&gt;DTD retrieval-------------This case is similar to external entity expansion, too. Some XML librarieslike Python's xml.dom.pulldom retrieve document type definitions from remoteor local locations. Several attack scenarios from the external entity caseapply to this issue as well.::    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;    &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot;      &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;    &lt;html&gt;        &lt;head/&gt;        &lt;body&gt;text&lt;/body&gt;    &lt;/html&gt;Python XML Libraries====================.. csv-table:: vulnerabilities and features   :header: &quot;kind&quot;, &quot;sax&quot;, &quot;etree&quot;, &quot;minidom&quot;, &quot;pulldom&quot;, &quot;xmlrpc&quot;, &quot;lxml&quot;, &quot;genshi&quot;   :widths: 24, 7, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 8   :stub-columns: 0   &quot;billion laughs&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;False (1)&quot;, &quot;False (5)&quot;   &quot;quadratic blowup&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;False (5)&quot;   &quot;external entity expansion (remote)&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;False (3)&quot;, &quot;False (4)&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, &quot;False (1)&quot;, &quot;False (5)&quot;   &quot;external entity expansion (local file)&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;False (3)&quot;, &quot;False (4)&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;False (5)&quot;   &quot;DTD retrieval&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, &quot;False (1)&quot;, &quot;False&quot;   &quot;gzip bomb&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;**partly** (2)&quot;, &quot;False&quot;   &quot;xpath support (7)&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;False&quot;   &quot;xsl(t) support (7)&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;, &quot;False&quot;   &quot;xinclude support (7)&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;**True** (6)&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, &quot;**True** (6)&quot;, &quot;**True**&quot;   &quot;C library&quot;, &quot;expat&quot;, &quot;expat&quot;, &quot;expat&quot;, &quot;expat&quot;, &quot;expat&quot;, &quot;libxml2&quot;, &quot;expat&quot;1. Lxml is protected against billion laughs attacks and doesn't do network   lookups by default.2. libxml2 and lxml are not directly vulnerable to gzip decompression bombs   but they don't protect you against them either.3. xml.etree doesn't expand entities and raises a ParserError when an entity   occurs.4. minidom doesn't expand entities and simply returns the unexpanded entity   verbatim.5. genshi.input of genshi 0.6 doesn't support entity expansion and raises a   ParserError when an entity occurs.6. Library has (limited) XInclude support but requires an additional step to   process inclusion.7. These are features but they may introduce exploitable holes, see   `Other things to consider`_Settings in standard library----------------------------xml.sax.handler Features........................feature_external_ges (http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities)  disables external entity expansionfeature_external_pes (http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities)  the option is ignored and doesn't modify any functionalityDOM xml.dom.xmlbuilder.Options..............................external_parameter_entities  ignoredexternal_general_entities  ignoredexternal_dtd_subset  ignoredentities  unsuredefusedxml==========The `defusedxml package`_ (`defusedxml on PyPI`_)contains several Python-only workarounds and fixesfor denial of service and other vulnerabilities in Python's XML libraries.In order to benefit from the protection you just have to import and use thelisted functions / classes from the right defusedxml module instead of theoriginal module. Merely `defusedxml.xmlrpc`_ is implemented as monkey patch.Instead of::   &gt;&gt;&gt; from xml.etree.ElementTree import parse   &gt;&gt;&gt; et = parse(xmlfile)alter code to::   &gt;&gt;&gt; from defusedxml.ElementTree import parse   &gt;&gt;&gt; et = parse(xmlfile)Additionally the package has an **untested** function to monkey patchall stdlib modules with ``defusedxml.defuse_stdlib()``.All functions and parser classes accept three additional keyword arguments.They return either the same objects as the original functions or compatiblesubclasses.forbid_dtd (default: False)  disallow XML with a ``&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;`` processing instruction and raise a  *DTDForbidden* exception when a DTD processing instruction is found.forbid_entities (default: True)  disallow XML with ``&lt;!ENTITY&gt;`` declarations inside the DTD and raise an  *EntitiesForbidden* exception when an entity is declared.forbid_external (default: True)  disallow any access to remote or local resources in external entities  or DTD and raising an *ExternalReferenceForbidden* exception when a DTD  or entity references an external resource.defusedxml (package)--------------------DefusedXmlException, DTDForbidden, EntitiesForbidden,ExternalReferenceForbidden, NotSupportedErrordefuse_stdlib() (*experimental*)defusedxml.cElementTree-----------------------**NOTE** ``defusedxml.cElementTree`` is deprecated and will be removed in afuture release. Import from ``defusedxml.ElementTree`` instead.parse(), iterparse(), fromstring(), XMLParserdefusedxml.ElementTree-----------------------parse(), iterparse(), fromstring(), XMLParserdefusedxml.expatreader----------------------create_parser(), DefusedExpatParserdefusedxml.sax--------------parse(), parseString(), make_parser()defusedxml.expatbuilder-----------------------parse(), parseString(), DefusedExpatBuilder, DefusedExpatBuilderNSdefusedxml.minidom------------------parse(), parseString()defusedxml.pulldom------------------parse(), parseString()defusedxml.xmlrpc-----------------The fix is implemented as monkey patch for the stdlib's xmlrpc package (3.x)or xmlrpclib module (2.x). The function `monkey_patch()` enables the fixes,`unmonkey_patch()` removes the patch and puts the code in its former state.The monkey patch protects against XML related attacks as well asdecompression bombs and excessively large requests or responses. The defaultsetting is 30 MB for requests, responses and gzip decompression. You canmodify the default by changing the module variable `MAX_DATA`. A value of`-1` disables the limit.defusedxml.lxml---------------**DEPRECATED** The module is deprecated and will be removed in a futurerelease.The module acts as an *example* how you could protect code that useslxml.etree. It implements a custom Element class that filters outEntity instances, a custom parser factory and a thread local storage forparser instances. It also has a check_docinfo() function which inspectsa tree for internal or external DTDs and entity declarations. In order tocheck for entities lxml &gt; 3.0 is required.parse(), fromstring()RestrictedElement, GlobalParserTLS, getDefaultParser(), check_docinfo()defusedexpat============The `defusedexpat package`_ (`defusedexpat on PyPI`_)comes with binary extensions and a`modified expat`_ library instead of the standard `expat parser`_. It'sbasically a stand-alone version of the patches for Python's standardlibrary C extensions.Modifications in expat----------------------new definitions::  XML_BOMB_PROTECTION  XML_DEFAULT_MAX_ENTITY_INDIRECTIONS  XML_DEFAULT_MAX_ENTITY_EXPANSIONS  XML_DEFAULT_RESET_DTDnew XML_FeatureEnum members::  XML_FEATURE_MAX_ENTITY_INDIRECTIONS  XML_FEATURE_MAX_ENTITY_EXPANSIONS  XML_FEATURE_IGNORE_DTDnew XML_Error members::  XML_ERROR_ENTITY_INDIRECTIONS  XML_ERROR_ENTITY_EXPANSIONnew API functions::  int XML_GetFeature(XML_Parser parser,                     enum XML_FeatureEnum feature,                     long *value);  int XML_SetFeature(XML_Parser parser,                     enum XML_FeatureEnum feature,                     long value);  int XML_GetFeatureDefault(enum XML_FeatureEnum feature,                            long *value);  int XML_SetFeatureDefault(enum XML_FeatureEnum feature,                            long value);XML_FEATURE_MAX_ENTITY_INDIRECTIONS   Limit the amount of indirections that are allowed to occur during the   expansion of a nested entity. A counter starts when an entity reference   is encountered. It resets after the entity is fully expanded. The limit   protects the parser against exponential entity expansion attacks (aka   billion laughs attack). When the limit is exceeded the parser stops and   fails with `XML_ERROR_ENTITY_INDIRECTIONS`.   A value of 0 disables the protection.   Supported range     0 .. UINT_MAX   Default     40XML_FEATURE_MAX_ENTITY_EXPANSIONS   Limit the total length of all entity expansions throughout the entire   document. The lengths of all entities are accumulated in a parser variable.   The setting protects against quadratic blowup attacks (lots of expansions   of a large entity declaration). When the sum of all entities exceeds   the limit, the parser stops and fails with `XML_ERROR_ENTITY_EXPANSION`.   A value of 0 disables the protection.   Supported range     0 .. UINT_MAX   Default     8 MiBXML_FEATURE_RESET_DTD   Reset all DTD information after the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; block has been parsed. When   the flag is set (default: false) all DTD information after the   endDoctypeDeclHandler has been called. The flag can be set inside the   endDoctypeDeclHandler. Without DTD information any entity reference in   the document body leads to `XML_ERROR_UNDEFINED_ENTITY`.   Supported range     0, 1   Default     0How to avoid XML vulnerabilities================================Best practices--------------* Don't allow DTDs* Don't expand entities* Don't resolve externals* Limit parse depth* Limit total input size* Limit parse time* Favor a SAX or iterparse-like parser for potential large data* Validate and properly quote arguments to XSL transformations and  XPath queries* Don't use XPath expression from untrusted sources* Don't apply XSL transformations that come untrusted sources(based on Brad Hill's `Attacking XML Security`_)Other things to consider========================XML, XML parsers and processing libraries have more features and possibleissue that could lead to DoS vulnerabilities or security exploits inapplications. I have compiled an incomplete list of theoretical issues thatneed further research and more attention. The list is deliberately pessimisticand a bit paranoid, too. It contains things that might go wrong under daffycircumstances.attribute blowup / hash collision attack----------------------------------------XML parsers may use an algorithm with quadratic runtime O(n :sup:`2`) tohandle attributes and namespaces. If it uses hash tables (dictionaries) tostore attributes and namespaces the implementation may be vulnerable tohash collision attacks, thus reducing the performance to O(n :sup:`2`) again.In either case an attacker is able to forge a denial of service attack withan XML document that contains thousands upon thousands of attributes ina single node.I haven't researched yet if expat, pyexpat or libxml2 are vulnerable.decompression bomb------------------The issue of decompression bombs (aka `ZIP bomb`_) apply to all XML librariesthat can parse compressed XML stream like gzipped HTTP streams or LZMA-edfiles. For an attacker it can reduce the amount of transmitted data by threemagnitudes or more. Gzip is able to compress 1 GiB zeros to roughly 1 MB,lzma is even better::    $ dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1024 | gzip &gt; zeros.gz    $ dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1024 | lzma -z &gt; zeros.xy    $ ls -sh zeros.*    1020K zeros.gz     148K zeros.xyNone of Python's standard XML libraries decompress streams except for``xmlrpclib``. The module is vulnerable &lt;https://bugs.python.org/issue16043&gt;to decompression bombs.lxml can load and process compressed data through libxml2 transparently.libxml2 can handle even very large blobs of compressed data efficientlywithout using too much memory. But it doesn't protect applications fromdecompression bombs. A carefully written SAX or iterparse-like approach canbe safe.Processing Instruction----------------------`PI`_'s like::  &lt;?xml-stylesheet type=&quot;text/xsl&quot; href=&quot;style.xsl&quot;?&gt;may impose more threats for XML processing. It depends if and how aprocessor handles processing instructions. The issue of URL retrieval withnetwork or local file access apply to processing instructions, too.Other DTD features------------------`DTD`_ has more features like ``&lt;!NOTATION&gt;``. I haven't researched howthese features may be a security threat.XPath-----XPath statements may introduce DoS vulnerabilities. Code should never executequeries from untrusted sources. An attacker may also be able to create an XMLdocument that makes certain XPath queries costly or resource hungry.XPath injection attacks-----------------------XPath injeciton attacks pretty much work like SQL injection attacks.Arguments to XPath queries must be quoted and validated properly, especiallywhen they are taken from the user. The page `Avoid the dangers of XPath injection`_list some ramifications of XPath injections.Python's standard library doesn't have XPath support. Lxml supportsparameterized XPath queries which does proper quoting. You just have to useits xpath() method correctly::   # DON'T   &gt;&gt;&gt; tree.xpath(&quot;/tag[@id='%s']&quot; % value)   # instead do   &gt;&gt;&gt; tree.xpath(&quot;/tag[@id=$tagid]&quot;, tagid=name)XInclude--------`XML Inclusion`_ is another way to load and include external files::   &lt;root xmlns:xi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude&quot;&gt;     &lt;xi:include href=&quot;filename.txt&quot; parse=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;   &lt;/root&gt;This feature should be disabled when XML files from an untrusted source areprocessed. Some Python XML libraries and libxml2 support XInclude but don'thave an option to sandbox inclusion and limit it to allowed directories.XMLSchema location------------------A validating XML parser may download schema files from the information in a``xsi:schemaLocation`` attribute.::  &lt;ead xmlns=&quot;urn:isbn:1-931666-22-9&quot;       xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;       xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;urn:isbn:1-931666-22-9 http://www.loc.gov/ead/ead.xsd&quot;&gt;  &lt;/ead&gt;XSL Transformation------------------You should keep in mind that XSLT is a Turing complete language. Neverprocess XSLT code from unknown or untrusted source! XSLT processors mayallow you to interact with external resources in ways you can't even imagine.Some processors even support extensions that allow read/write access to filesystem, access to JRE objects or scripting with Jython.Example from `Attacking XML Security`_ for Xalan-J::    &lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot;     xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;     xmlns:rt=&quot;http://xml.apache.org/xalan/java/java.lang.Runtime&quot;     xmlns:ob=&quot;http://xml.apache.org/xalan/java/java.lang.Object&quot;     exclude-result-prefixes= &quot;rt ob&quot;&gt;     &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;       &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;runtimeObject&quot; select=&quot;rt:getRuntime()&quot;/&gt;       &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;command&quot;         select=&quot;rt:exec($runtimeObject, &amp;apos;c:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe&amp;apos;)&quot;/&gt;       &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;commandAsString&quot; select=&quot;ob:toString($command)&quot;/&gt;       &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$commandAsString&quot;/&gt;     &lt;/xsl:template&gt;    &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;Related CVEs============CVE-2013-1664  Unrestricted entity expansion induces DoS vulnerabilities in Python XML  libraries (XML bomb)CVE-2013-1665  External entity expansion in Python XML libraries inflicts potential  security flaws and DoS vulnerabilitiesOther languages / frameworks=============================Several other programming languages and frameworks are vulnerable as well. Acouple of them are affected by the fact that libxml2 up to 2.9.0 has noprotection against quadratic blowup attacks. Most of them have potentialdangerous default settings for entity expansion and external entities, too.Perl----Perl's XML::Simple is vulnerable to quadratic entity expansion and externalentity expansion (both local and remote).Ruby----Ruby's REXML document parser is vulnerable to entity expansion attacks(both quadratic and exponential) but it doesn't do external entityexpansion by default. In order to counteract entity expansion you have todisable the feature::  REXML::Document.entity_expansion_limit = 0libxml-ruby and hpricot don't expand entities in their default configuration.PHP---PHP's SimpleXML API is vulnerable to quadratic entity expansion and loadsentities from local and remote resources. The option ``LIBXML_NONET`` disablesnetwork access but still allows local file access. ``LIBXML_NOENT`` seems tohave no effect on entity expansion in PHP 5.4.6.C# / .NET / Mono----------------Information in `XML DoS and Defenses (MSDN)`_ suggest that .NET isvulnerable with its default settings. The article contains code snippetshow to create a secure XML reader::  XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings();  settings.ProhibitDtd = false;  settings.MaxCharactersFromEntities = 1024;  settings.XmlResolver = null;  XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(stream, settings);Java----Untested. The documentation of Xerces and its `Xerces SecurityMananger`_sounds like Xerces is also vulnerable to billion laugh attacks with itsdefault settings. It also does entity resolving when an``org.xml.sax.EntityResolver`` is configured. I'm not yet sure about thedefault setting here.Java specialists suggest to have a custom builder factory::  DocumentBuilderFactory builderFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();  builderFactory.setXIncludeAware(False);  builderFactory.setExpandEntityReferences(False);  builderFactory.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, True);  # either  builderFactory.setFeature(&quot;http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl&quot;, True);  # or if you need DTDs  builderFactory.setFeature(&quot;http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities&quot;, False);  builderFactory.setFeature(&quot;http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities&quot;, False);  builderFactory.setFeature(&quot;http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd&quot;, False);  builderFactory.setFeature(&quot;http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-dtd-grammar&quot;, False);TODO====* DOM: Use xml.dom.xmlbuilder options for entity handling* SAX: take feature_external_ges and feature_external_pes (?) into account* test experimental monkey patching of stdlib modules* improve documentationLicense=======Copyright (c) 2013-2017 by Christian Heimes &lt;christian@python.org&gt;Licensed to PSF under a Contributor Agreement.See https://www.python.org/psf/license for licensing details.Acknowledgements================Brett Cannon (Python Core developer)  review and code cleanupAntoine Pitrou (Python Core developer)  code reviewAaron Patterson, Ben Murphy and Michael Koziarski (Ruby community)  Many thanks to Aaron, Ben and Michael from the Ruby community for their  report and assistance.Thierry Carrez (OpenStack)  Many thanks to Thierry for his report to the Python Security Response  Team on behalf of the OpenStack security team.Carl Meyer (Django)  Many thanks to Carl for his report to PSRT on behalf of the Django security  team.Daniel Veillard (libxml2)  Many thanks to Daniel for his insight and assistance with libxml2.semantics GmbH (https://www.semantics.de/)  Many thanks to my employer semantics for letting me work on the issue  during working hours as part of semantics's open source initiative.References==========* `XML DoS and Defenses (MSDN)`_* `Billion Laughs`_ on Wikipedia* `ZIP bomb`_ on Wikipedia* `Configure SAX parsers for secure processing`_* `Testing for XML Injection`_.. _defusedxml package: https://github.com/tiran/defusedxml.. _defusedxml on PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/defusedxml.. _defusedexpat package: https://github.com/tiran/defusedexpat.. _defusedexpat on PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/defusedexpat.. _modified expat: https://github.com/tiran/expat.. _expat parser: http://expat.sourceforge.net/.. _Attacking XML Security: https://www.isecpartners.com/media/12976/iSEC-HILL-Attacking-XML-Security-bh07.pdf.. _Billion Laughs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs.. _XML DoS and Defenses (MSDN): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee335713.aspx.. _ZIP bomb: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb.. _DTD: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition.. _PI: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_Instruction.. _Avoid the dangers of XPath injection: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-xpathinjection/index.html.. _Configure SAX parsers for secure processing: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-tipcfsx/index.html.. _Testing for XML Injection: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_XML_Injection_(OWASP-DV-008).. _Xerces SecurityMananger: https://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/javadocs/xerces2/org/apache/xerces/util/SecurityManager.html.. _XML Inclusion: https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/#include_elementChangelog=========defusedxml 0.7.1---------------------*Release date: 08-Mar-2021*- Fix regression ``defusedxml.ElementTree.ParseError`` (#63)  The ``ParseError`` exception is now the same class object as  ``xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError`` again.defusedxml 0.7.0----------------*Release date: 4-Mar-2021*- No changesdefusedxml 0.7.0rc2-------------------*Release date: 12-Jan-2021*- Re-add and deprecate ``defusedxml.cElementTree``- Use GitHub Actions instead of TravisCI- Restore ``ElementTree`` attribute of ``xml.etree`` module after patchingdefusedxml 0.7.0rc1-------------------*Release date: 04-May-2020*- Add support for Python 3.9- ``defusedxml.cElementTree`` is not available with Python 3.9.- Python 2 is deprecate.

It has been deprecated and  ignored for a long time. The DefusedXMLParser still takes a html argument.  A deprecation warning is issued when the argument is False and a TypeError  when it's True.- defusedxml now fails early when pyexpat stdlib module is not available or  broken.- defusedxml.ElementTree.__all__ now lists ParseError as public attribute.- The defusedxml.ElementTree and defusedxml.cElementTree modules had a typo  and used XMLParse instead of XMLParser as an alias for DefusedXMLParser.  Both the old and fixed name are now available.defusedxml 0.5.0----------------*Release date: 07-Feb-2017*- No changesdefusedxml 0.5.0.rc1--------------------*Release date: 28-Jan-2017*- Add compatibility with Python 3.6- Drop support for Python 2.6, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3- Fix lxml tests (XMLSyntaxError: Detected an entity reference loop)defusedxml 0.4.1----------------*Release date: 28-Mar-2013*- Add more demo exploits, e.g. python_external.py and Xalan XSLT demos.- Improved documentation.defusedxml 0.4--------------*Release date: 25-Feb-2013*- As per http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q1/340 please REJECT  CVE-2013-0278, CVE-2013-0279 and CVE-2013-0280 and use CVE-2013-1664,  CVE-2013-1665 for OpenStack/etc.- Add missing parser_list argument to sax.make_parser(). The argument is  ignored, though.
