	<longdescription># Microsoft Graph SDK for PythonGet started with the Microsoft Graph SDK for Python by integrating the [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/overview) into your Python application.&gt; **Note:** &gt; * This SDK allows you to build applications using the [v1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/use-the-api#version) of Microsoft Graph. If you want to try the latest Microsoft Graph APIs, try the [beta](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-beta-sdk-python) SDK.  &gt;&gt; * The Microsoft Graph Python SDK is currently in community preview. During this period we're expecting breaking changes to happen to the SDK as we make updates based on feedback. Don't use this SDK in production environments. For details see [SDKs in preview or GA status](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/sdks-overview#sdks-in-preview-or-ga-status).## 1. Installation```pypip install msgraph-sdk```## 2. Getting started with Microsoft Graph### 2.1 Register your applicationRegister your application by following the steps at [Register your app with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/auth-register-app-v2).### 2.2 Create an AuthenticationProvider objectAn instance of the **GraphServiceClient** class handles building client. To create a new instance of this class, you need to provide an instance of **AuthenticationProvider**, which can authenticate requests to Microsoft Graph.&gt; **Note**: For authentication we support both `sync` and `async` credential classes from `azure.identity`. Please see the azure identity [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity?view=azure-python) for more information.```py# Example using async credentials.from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredentialfrom kiota_authentication_azure.azure_identity_authentication_provider import AzureIdentityAuthenticationProvidercredential=DefaultAzureCredential()auth_provider = AzureIdentityAuthenticationProvider(credential)```The above example uses default scopes for [app-only access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#delegated-permissions).  If using [delegated access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#delegated-permissions) you can provide custom scopes:```pyscopes = ['User.Read', 'Mail.Read']credential=DeviceCodeCredential()auth_provider = AzureIdentityAuthenticationProvider(credential, scopes=scopes)```### 2.3 Initialise a GraphRequestAdapter objectThe SDK uses an adapter object that handles the HTTP concerns. This HTTP adapter object is used to build the Graph client for making requests.To initialise one using the authentication provider created in the previous step:```pyfrom msgraph import GraphRequestAdapteradapter = GraphRequestAdapter(auth_provider)```We currently use [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/) as our HTTP client. You can pass your custom configured `httpx.AsyncClient` using:```pyimport httpxfrom msgraph import GraphRequestAdapterfrom msgraph_core import GraphClientFactoryhttp_client = GraphClientFactory.create_with_default_middleware(client=httpx.AsyncClient())request_adapter = GraphRequestAdapter(auth_provider, http_client)```### 2.3 Get a GraphServiceClient objectYou must get a **GraphServiceClient** object to make requests against the service.```pyfrom msgraph import GraphServiceClientclient = GraphServiceClient(request_adapter)```## 3. Make requests against the serviceAfter you have a **GraphServiceClient** that is authenticated, you can begin making calls against the service. The requests against the service look like our [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-1.0).&gt; **Note**: This SDK offers an asynchronous API by default. Async is a concurrency model that is far more efficient than multi-threading, and can provide significant performance benefits and enable the use of long-lived network connections such as WebSockets. We support popular python async envronments such as `asyncio`, `anyio` or `trio`.The following is a complete example that shows how to fetch a user from Microsoft Graph.```pyimport asynciofrom azure.identity.aio import ClientSecretCredentialfrom kiota_authentication_azure.azure_identity_authentication_provider import AzureIdentityAuthenticationProviderfrom msgraph import GraphRequestAdapterfrom msgraph import GraphServiceClientcredential = ClientSecretCredential(    'tenant_id',    'client_id',    'client_secret')scopes = ['User.Read']auth_provider = AzureIdentityAuthenticationProvider(credential, scopes=scopes)request_adapter = GraphRequestAdapter(auth_provider)client = GraphServiceClient(request_adapter)async def get_user():    user = await client.users.by_user_id('userPrincipalName').get()    print(user.display_name)asyncio.run(get_user())```Note that to calling `me` requires a signed-in user and therefore delegated permissions. See [Authenticating Users](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-python#authenticate-users)) for more:```pyimport asynciofrom azure.identity import InteractiveBrowserCredentialfrom kiota_authentication_azure.azure_identity_authentication_provider import AzureIdentityAuthenticationProviderfrom msgraph import GraphRequestAdapterfrom msgraph import GraphServiceClientcredential = InteractiveBrowserCredential()scopes=['User.Read']auth_provider = AzureIdentityAuthenticationProvider(credential, scopes=scopes)request_adapter = GraphRequestAdapter(auth_provider)client = GraphServiceClient(request_adapter)async def me():    me = await client.me.get()    print(me.display_name)asyncio.run(me())```### 3.1 Error HandlingFailed requests raise `APIError` exceptions. You can handle these exceptions using `try` `catch` statements.```pyfrom kiota_abstractions.api_error import APIErrorasync def get_user():    try:        user = await client.users.by_user_id('userID').get()        print(user.user_principal_name, user.display_name, user.id)    except APIError as e:        print(f'Error: {e.error.message}')asyncio.run(get_user())```## Documentation and resources* [Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/overview)* [Microsoft Graph website](https://aka.ms/graph)## UpgradingFor detailed information on breaking changes, bug fixes and new functionality introduced during major upgrades, check out our [Upgrade Guide](UPGRADING.md)## IssuesView or log issues on the [Issues](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-python/issues) tab in the repo.## ContributePlease read our [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines carefully for advice on how to contribute to this repo.## Copyright and licenseCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
