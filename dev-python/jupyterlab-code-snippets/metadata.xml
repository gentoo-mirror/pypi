You may use`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.```bash# Clone the repo to your local environment# Move to jupyter-lab-code-snippets directory# Install dependenciesjlpm# Build Typescript sourcejlpm build# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLabjupyter labextension install .# Rebuild Typescript source after making changesjlpm build# Rebuild JupyterLab after making any changesjupyter lab build```You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab in watch mode to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension and application.```bash# Watch the source directory in another terminal tabjlpm watch# Run jupyterlab in watch mode in one terminal tabjupyter lab --watch```Now every change will be built locally and bundled into JupyterLab. Be sure to refresh your browser page after saving file changes to reload the extension (note: you'll need to wait for webpack to finish, which can take 10s+ at times).### Uninstall```bashjupyter labextension uninstall jupyterlab-code-snippets```OR```bashpip uninstall jupyterlab-code-snippets```</longdescription>
