	<longdescription># HELICS Apps[HELICS](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS) is a cross-platform co-simulation framework that enables multiplesimulation tools to exchange data and stay synchronized in time to create larger simulations. This is a set ofbinary wheels for macOS, Windows, and Linux for installing the collection of HELICS apps utilities. If you wantthe Python interface for writing HELICS programs in Python, see the [helics](https://pypi.org/project/helics/)pip package.## InstallationAt minimum for the Linux binary wheels to work properly, [pip 19.0 is required](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/platform-compatibility-tags/#manylinux-compatibility-support).Regardless of your platform, you should probably upgrade pip with `python -m pip install --upgrade` to makesure the right binary package is found. If you aren't on a supported platform, you will need to compilethe HELICS apps from source or check if your system package manager has a copy of them.After upgrading pip, running `python -m pip install helics-apps` should fetch a binary wheel if one is available for your platform.### Binary distributionsThis package provides pre-compiled binary wheels for the following operating systems* Linux 64-bit (manylinux2010 compatible -- glibc 2.12+, most popular distributions released since May 2010)* macOS (10.9+) 64-bit* Windows 32/64-bit### Source distributionsUnfortunately, there is no source distribution for this package at this time since that requires compiling HELICS from source.## ReleaseHELICS is distributed under the terms of the BSD-3 clause license.
