	<longdescription>QCoDeS |PyPi| |DOCS| |PyPI python versions| |DOI|=================================================|Build Status Github| |Build Status Github Docs| |Codacy badge|QCoDeS is a Python-based data acquisition framework developed by theCopenhagen / Delft / Sydney / Microsoft quantum computing consortium.While it has been developed to serve the needs of nanoelectronic deviceexperiments, it is not inherently limited to such experiments, and canbe used anywhere a system with many degrees of freedom is controllableby computer.To learn more about QCoDeS, browse our `homepage &lt;http://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes&gt;`_ .To get a feeling of QCoDeS read`15 minutes to QCoDeS &lt;http://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/examples/15_minutes_to_QCoDeS.html&gt;`__,and/or browse the Jupyter notebooks in `docs/examples&lt;https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/tree/main/docs/examples&gt;`__ .QCoDeS is compatible with Python 3.7+. It is primarily intended for usefrom Jupyter notebooks, but can be used from traditional terminal-basedshells and in stand-alone scripts as well. The features in`qcodes.utils.magic` are exclusively for Jupyter notebooks.Default branch is now main==========================The default branch in QCoDeS has been renamed to main.If you are working with a local clone of QCoDeS you should update it as follows:* Run `git fetch origin` and `git checkout main`* Run `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main` to update your HEAD reference.Install=======In general, refer to `here &lt;http://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/start/index.html#installation&gt;`__for installation.Docs====Read it `here &lt;http://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes&gt;`__ .Documentation is updated and deployed on every successful build in main.We use sphinx for documentations, makefiles are provided both forWindows, and \*nix, so that you can build the documentation locally.Make sure that you have the extra dependencies required to install the docs.. code:: bash    pip install -r docs_requirements.txtGo to the directory ``docs`` and.. code:: bash    make htmlThis generate a webpage, index.html, in ``docs/_build/html`` with therendered html.QCoDeS Loop===========The modules ``qcodes.data``, ``qcodes.plots``, ``qcodes.actions``,``qcodes.loops``, ``qcodes.measure``, ``qcodes.extensions.slack``and ``qcodes.utils.magic`` that were part of QCoDeS until version 0.37.0.have been moved into an independent package called qcodes_loop.Please see it's `repository &lt;https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes_loop/&gt;`_ and`documentation &lt;https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes_loop/&gt;`_ for more information.For the time being it is possible to automatically install the qcodes_looppackage when installing qcodes by executing ``pip install qcodes[loop]``.Code of Conduct===============QCoDeS strictly adheres to the `Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct &lt;https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/&gt;`__Contributing============The QCoDeS instrument drivers developed by the members ofthe QCoDeS community but not supported by the QCoDeS developers are contained inhttps://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes_contrib_driversSee `Contributing &lt;https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/tree/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst&gt;`__ for general information about bug/issuereports, contributing code, style, and testing.License=======See `License &lt;https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/tree/main/LICENSE&gt;`__... |Build Status Github| image:: https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/workflows/Run%20mypy%20and%20pytest/badge.svg    :target: https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Run+mypy+and+pytest%22.. |Build Status Github Docs| image:: https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/workflows/build%20docs/badge.svg    :target: https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/actions?query=workflow%3A%22build+docs%22.. |Codacy badge| image:: https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/6c9e0e5712bf4c6285d6f717aa8e84fa    :alt: Codacy Badge    :target: https://app.codacy.com/manual/qcodes/Qcodes?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=QCoDeS/Qcodes&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings.. |PyPi| image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/qcodes.svg    :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/qcodes.. |PyPI python versions| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/qcodes.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/qcodes/.. |DOCS| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/read%20-thedocs-ff66b4.svg   :target: http://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes.. |DOI| image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/37137879.svg   :target: https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/37137879</longdescription>
