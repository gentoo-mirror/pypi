	<longdescription>====Blue====Some folks like `black &lt;https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&gt;`_ but Iprefer `blue &lt;https://blue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_.What is blue?=============``blue`` is a somewhat less uncompromising code formatter than ``black``, theOG of Python formatters.  We love the idea of automatically formatting Pythoncode, for the same reasons that inspired ``black``, however we take issue withsome of the decisions ``black`` makes.  Kudos to ``black`` for pioneering codeformatting for Python, and for its excellent implementation.Where the ``blue`` maintainers disagree with the stylistic (andunconfigurable) choices made by ``black``, we monkeypatch to change thesedecisions to our own liking.  We intend for these differences to be minimal;even in cases where we'd prefer something different, there's a lot we can livewith for the sake of consistency.We'd prefer not to fork or monkeypatch.  Instead, our hope is that eventuallywe'll be able to work with the ``black`` maintainers to add just a little bitof configuration and merge back into the ``black`` project.  We'd be ecstaticif ``blue`` eventually were retired.  Until then, we'll maintain our small setof hacks on top of ``black`` and carefully consider what other deviations areneeded to assuage our sensitive, but experienced, eye.How do I use blue?==================Exactly the same as you would use ``black``.  Invoke and configure ``blue`` asyou would ``black`` -- just replace the ``black`` command with ``blue``, sitback, and enjoy even betterly formatted Python code!  You can refer to`black's &lt;https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&gt;`_ documentation foranything not listed here.Try it out now using `iblueit.dev &lt;https://iblueit.dev/&gt;`_.So what's different?====================Here is a brief list of differences between ``blue`` and ``black``:* ``blue`` defaults to single-quoted strings.  This is probably the most  painful ``black`` choice to our eyes, and the thing that inspired ``blue``.  We strongly prefer using single quoted strings over double quoted strings for  everything *except* docstrings and triple quoted strings (TQS).  Don't ask us  why we prefer double-quotes for TQS; it just looks better to us!  For all  other strings, ``blue`` defaults to single quoted strings.  In the case of  docstrings, those always use TQS with double-quotes.* ``blue`` defaults to line lengths of 79 characters. Nearly every project  creates a pyproject.toml just to change this one setting so making it  consistent with PEP 8 seems relatively harmless.* ``blue`` preserves the whitespace before the hash mark for right hanging  comments.* ``blue`` supports multiple config files: ``pyproject.toml``, ``setup.cfg``,  ``tox.ini``, and ``.blue``.We are `accumulating &lt;https://github.com/grantjenks/blue/issues/2&gt;`_ a list ofother deviations we are considering.  As we decide to implement any particularsuggestion, we'll turn those into individual issues and tackle themone-by-one.  If you have suggestions for other deviations from ``black``'schoices, please open a separate ticket on our tracker, and we'll see how itgoes!Why &quot;blue&quot;?===========Several reasons!  If your formatter is going to beat up your code, it'll leaveit black and blue, or maybe in this case, black *or* blue.  Blue is better!We also thought about &quot;tan&quot; because, yum!  But that project name was alreadytaken.  Frankly, &quot;blue&quot; was also taken, but largely unused.  Our thanks toNick Ficano for donating the project namespace to us!Blue is also the color of `LinkedIn &lt;https://www.linkedin.com/&gt;`_, theauthors' gracious employer, and we intend to socialize its use within ourcompany code base.Contributors============``blue`` thanks this list of contributors for all its wonderful goodness.* The `wonderful folks &lt;https://github.com/psf/black#authors&gt;`_ from the  ``black`` project.* Grant Jenks* Barry Warsaw* Corey from FutureSpaceDesigns for the unofficial logo and `blue project  merchandise &lt;https://www.teepublic.com/t-shirt/6556561-tobias-blue&gt;`_.``blue`` is licensed under the terms of the Apache License Version 2.0.``black`` is `licensed &lt;https://github.com/psf/black#license&gt;`_ under theterms of the MIT license.Project details===============.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-blue-blue.svg   :target: https://blue.readthedocs.io/.. image:: https://github.com/grantjenks/blue/workflows/integration/badge.svg   :target: https://github.com/grantjenks/blue/actions?query=workflow%3Aintegration.. image:: https://github.com/grantjenks/blue/workflows/release/badge.svg   :target: https://github.com/grantjenks/blue/actions?query=workflow%3Arelease* Project home: https://github.com/grantjenks/blue* Report bugs and suggestions at: https://github.com/grantjenks/blue/issues* Code hosting: https://github.com/grantjenks/blue.git* Documentation: https://blue.readthedocs.io/en/latest* Try it out: https://iblueit.dev</longdescription>
