Some issues that windows users can have are:- Lists not displaying properly- MPV integration could not work- file path issuesIf you find some bug, please open and issue here on github.## Tips### Previous sessionsIn the start screen you can press the `arrow up` or `Tab` to select something you have watched before. Or even type one of the numbers on the left instead of typing the whole name.&gt; All lists are scrollable, you check by looking for a little arrow at the top or bottom of the list.As 1 will always be the last anime/series watched, you can use this in the command line to jump directly on your previous session.```bashanime 1 --yes```&gt; Here I also used `--yes` to accept all prompts### Command argumentsAll available arguments are listed below:&gt; -  `--episodes` select which episodes to watch. The syntax is `start:end` or `episode`.&gt; -  `--player` specify the player do you want to use (default: mpv)&gt; -  `--scraper` use specified scraper to fetch the episodes&gt; -  `--update` fetch the number of total episodes of the items in history.&gt; -  `--server` serves a list of animes as a m3u playlist through the network.&gt; -  `--config` change the default config.&gt; -  `--anilist_sync` sync your local history with anilist&gt; -  `--yes` accept all default options. it is useful then you already know the full name of the anime/series&gt; -  `--config-dir` specify the folder to save the playlist filefor more information run `anime --help`### Anilistto enable anilist sync,to enable synchronization with anilist, you must first run the command `anime --config` and select the field 'token'. This will open a browser window asking for confirmation. ### MPVI strongly recommend the use of MPV player on top of this cli program, since with MPV is possible to start the stream at the exact point you left on the previous session.I recommend my [MPV config](https://github.com/AlanJs26/mpv), it comes with a pretty ui, shaders and some plugins. One of them being `skiptosilence`, that is used to jump anime openings! (I have mapped `Tab` to activate it)## To-do- [x] upload project to pypi- [ ] add more sources</longdescription>
