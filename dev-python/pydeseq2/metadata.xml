If you want to have the latest version of the documentation, you can build it from source.Please go to the dedicated [README.md](https://github.com/owkin/PyDESeq2/blob/main/docs/README.md) for information on how to do so.### DataThe quick start examples use synthetic data, provided in this repo (see [datasets](https://github.com/owkin/PyDESeq2/blob/main/datasets/README.md).)The experiments described in our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.14.520412v1) rely on datafrom [The Cancer Genome Atlas](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga),which may be obtained from this [portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/).## ContributingPlease the [Contributing](https://pydeseq2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/contributing.html) section of thedocumentation to see how you can contribute to PyDESeq2.### 1 - Download the repository`git clone https://github.com/owkin/PyDESeq2.git`### 2 - Create a conda environmentRun `conda env create -n pydeseq2 python=3.8` (or higher python version) to create the `pydeseq2` environment and then activate it:`conda activate pydeseq2`.`cd` to the root of the repo and run `pip install -e .&quot;[dev]&quot;` to install in developer mode.Then, run `pre-commit install`.The `pre-commit` tool will automatically run [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/), and check [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) compatibilityPyDESeq2 is a living project and any contributions are welcome! Feel free to open new PRs or issues.## Development RoadmapHere are some of the features and improvements we plan to implement in the future:- [x] Integration to the [scverse](https://scverse.org/) ecosystem:  * [x] Refactoring to use the [AnnData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/) data structure  * [x] Submitting a PR to be listed as an [scverse ecosystem](https://github.com/scverse/ecosystem-packages/) package- [x] Variance-stabilizing transformation- [ ] Improving multi-factor analysis:  * [x] Allowing n-level factors (only bi-level for now)  * [ ] Implementing interaction terms## Citing this work```@article{muzellec2022pydeseq2,  title={PyDESeq2: a python package for bulk RNA-seq differential expression analysis},  author={Muzellec, Boris and Telenczuk, Maria and Cabeli, Vincent and Andreux, Mathieu},  year={2022},  doi = {10.1101/2022.12.14.520412},  journal={bioRxiv},}```## References[1] Love, M.
