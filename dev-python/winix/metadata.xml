	<longdescription># Winix ControllerThis is a Python library for controlling Winix C545 Air Purifierdevices. I reverse-engineered the API calls from the Android app. Thereare a few weird idiosyncrasies with the Winix backends.Included in this package is a CLI program `winixctl`.## SetupInstall using PyPI: `pip install winix`.You then have access to the `winix` module in python as wellas the `winixctl` command for shell (which uses the library).## `winixctl` CLI```$ winixctlusage: winixctl [-h] [--device DEVICE_SELECTOR] {login,refresh,devices,getstate,fan,power,mode,plasmawave} ...Winix C545 Air Purifier Controlpositional arguments:  {login,refresh,devices,getstate,fan,power,mode,plasmawave}    login               Authenticate Winix account    refresh             Refresh account device metadata    devices             List registered Winix devices    getstate            Get device state    fan                 Fan speed controls    power               Power controls    mode                Mode controls    plasmawave          Plasmawave controlsoptional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  --device DEVICE_SELECTOR, -D DEVICE_SELECTOR                        Device Index/Mac/Alias to use```In order to control your device, you first must run `winixctl login`.this will save a token from the Winix backend in a file on your systemat `~/config/winix/config.json`. It will prompt you for a usernameand password. You can use the `--username` and `--password` flags as well.You can see the devives registered to your winix accountwith `winixctl devices`.    ~/dev/winix(master*) Â» winixctl devices    1 devices:    Device#0 (default) -------------------------------          Device ID : 123456abcde_********** (hidden)                Mac : 123456abcde              Alias : Bedroom           Location : SROU    Missing a device? You might need to run refresh.The last portion of the Device ID is hidden as it can be used to controlthe device.### Multi-device SupportBy default the commands will work on the first device you have in your Winix account. If youhave multiple air purifiers, you can specify which device to use by specifyinga value for the top-level `--device` flag (short: `-D`).You may specify one of:- The device **index**. Example: `0` _(the default device selector)_.- The device **mac**. Example: `123456abcde`. Mac values stay the same between device registration.    If you have a device that you move between Wifi networks frequently then you will want    to use this.- The device **alias**. Example: `bedroom`. This is the most human-friendly version.**Examples**Turn off the bedroom air purifier _using an alias as the selector_:    winixctl -D bedroom power off</longdescription>
