	<longdescription># Azure DataLake service client library for PythonOverviewThis preview package for Python includes ADLS Gen2 specific API support made available in Storage SDK. This includes:1. New directory level operations (Create, Rename, Delete) for hierarchical namespace enabled (HNS) storage account. For HNS enabled accounts, the rename/move operations are atomic.2. Permission related operations (Get/Set ACLs) for hierarchical namespace enabled (HNS) accounts.[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-file-datalake/azure/storage/filedatalake)| [Package (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-storage-file-datalake/)| [Package (Conda)](https://anaconda.org/microsoft/azure-storage/)| [API reference documentation](https://aka.ms/azsdk-python-storage-filedatalake-ref)| [Product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/)| [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-file-datalake/samples)## Getting started### Prerequisites* Python 3.7 or later is required to use this package. For more details, please read our page on [Azure SDK for Python version support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Azure-SDKs-Python-version-support-policy).* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and an[Azure storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-quickstart-create-account) to use this package.### Install the packageInstall the Azure DataLake Storage client library for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):```bashpip install azure-storage-file-datalake --pre```### Create a storage accountIf you wish to create a new storage account, you can use the[Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-quickstart-create-account#create-an-account-using-the-azure-portal),[Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-quickstart-create-account#create-an-account-using-powershell),or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-quickstart-create-account#create-an-account-using-azure-cli):```bash# Create a new resource group to hold the storage account -# if using an existing resource group, skip this stepaz group create --name my-resource-group --location westus2# Install the extension 'Storage-Preview'az extension add --name storage-preview# Create the storage accountaz storage account create --name my-storage-account-name --resource-group my-resource-group --sku Standard_LRS --kind StorageV2 --hierarchical-namespace true```### Authenticate the clientInteraction with DataLake Storage starts with an instance of the DataLakeServiceClient class. You need an existing storage account, its URL, and a credential to instantiate the client object.#### Get credentialsTo authenticate the client you have a few options:1. Use a SAS token string2. Use an account shared access key3. Use a token credential from [azure.identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity)Alternatively, you can authenticate with a storage connection string using the `from_connection_string` method. See example: [Client creation with a connection string](#client-creation-with-a-connection-string).You can omit the credential if your account URL already has a SAS token.#### Create clientOnce you have your account URL and credentials ready, you can create the DataLakeServiceClient:```pythonfrom azure.storage.filedatalake import DataLakeServiceClientservice = DataLakeServiceClient(account_url=&quot;https://&lt;my-storage-account-name&gt;.dfs.core.windows.net/&quot;, credential=credential)```## Key conceptsDataLake storage offers four types of resources:* The storage account* A file system in the storage account* A directory under the file system* A file in a the file system or under directory### Async Clients This library includes a complete async API supported on Python 3.5+. To use it, you mustfirst install an async transport, such as [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/).See[azure-core documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#transport)for more information.Async clients and credentials should be closed when they're no longer needed. Theseobjects are async context managers and define async `close` methods.#### ClientsThe DataLake Storage SDK provides four different clients to interact with the DataLake Service:1. **DataLakeServiceClient** - this client interacts with the DataLake Service at the account level.    It provides operations to retrieve and configure the account properties    as well as list, create, and delete file systems within the account.    For operations relating to a specific file system, directory or file, clients for those entities    can also be retrieved using the `get_file_client`, `get_directory_client` or `get_file_system_client` functions.2. **FileSystemClient** - this client represents interaction with a specific    file system, even if that file system does not exist yet. It provides operations to create, delete, or    configure file systems and includes operations to list paths under file system, upload, and delete file or    directory in the file system.    For operations relating to a specific file, the client can also be retrieved using    the `get_file_client` function.    For operations relating to a specific directory, the client can be retrieved using    the `get_directory_client` function.3. **DataLakeDirectoryClient** - this client represents interaction with a specific    directory, even if that directory does not exist yet. It provides directory operations create, delete, rename,    get properties and set properties operations.3. **DataLakeFileClient** - this client represents interaction with a specific    file, even if that file does not exist yet. It provides file operations to append data, flush data, delete,    create, and read file.4. **DataLakeLeaseClient** - this client represents lease interactions with a FileSystemClient, DataLakeDirectoryClient    or DataLakeFileClient. It provides operations to acquire, renew, release, change, and break leases on the resources.## ExamplesThe following sections provide several code snippets covering some of the most common Storage DataLake tasks, including:* [Client creation with a connection string](#client-creation-with-a-connection-string)* [Uploading a file](#uploading-a-file)* [Downloading a file](#downloading-a-file)* [Enumerating paths](#enumerating-paths)### Client creation with a connection stringCreate the DataLakeServiceClient using the connection string to your Azure Storage account.```pythonfrom azure.storage.filedatalake import DataLakeServiceClientservice = DataLakeServiceClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=&quot;my_connection_string&quot;)```### Uploading a fileUpload a file to your file system.```pythonfrom azure.storage.filedatalake import DataLakeFileClientdata = b&quot;abc&quot;file = DataLakeFileClient.from_connection_string(&quot;my_connection_string&quot;,                                                 file_system_name=&quot;myfilesystem&quot;, file_path=&quot;myfile&quot;)file.create_file ()file.append_data(data, offset=0, length=len(data))file.flush_data(len(data))```### Downloading a fileDownload a file from your file system.```pythonfrom azure.storage.filedatalake import DataLakeFileClientfile = DataLakeFileClient.from_connection_string(&quot;my_connection_string&quot;,                                                 file_system_name=&quot;myfilesystem&quot;, file_path=&quot;myfile&quot;)with open(&quot;./BlockDestination.txt&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;) as my_file:    download = file.download_file()    download.readinto(my_file)```### Enumerating pathsList the paths in your file system.```pythonfrom azure.storage.filedatalake import FileSystemClientfile_system = FileSystemClient.from_connection_string(&quot;my_connection_string&quot;, file_system_name=&quot;myfilesystem&quot;)paths = file_system.get_paths()for path in paths:    print(path.name + '\n')```## Optional ConfigurationOptional keyword arguments that can be passed in at the client and per-operation level.### Retry Policy configurationUse the following keyword arguments when instantiating a client to configure the retry policy:* __retry_total__ (int): Total number of retries to allow. Takes precedence over other counts.Pass in `retry_total=0` if you do not want to retry on requests. Defaults to 10.* __retry_connect__ (int): How many connection-related errors to retry on. Defaults to 3.* __retry_read__ (int): How many times to retry on read errors. Defaults to 3.* __retry_status__ (int): How many times to retry on bad status codes. Defaults to 3.* __retry_to_secondary__ (bool): Whether the request should be retried to secondary, if able.This should only be enabled of RA-GRS accounts are used and potentially stale data can be handled.Defaults to `False`.### Other client / per-operation configurationOther optional configuration keyword arguments that can be specified on the client or per-operation.**Client keyword arguments:*** __connection_timeout__ (int): The number of seconds the client will wait to establish a connection to the server.Defaults to 20 seconds.* __read_timeout__ (int): The number of seconds the client will wait, between consecutive read operations, for aresponse from the server. This is a socket level timeout and is not affected by overall data size. Client-side read timeouts will be automatically retried. Defaults to 60 seconds.* __transport__ (Any): User-provided transport to send the HTTP request.**Per-operation keyword arguments:*** __raw_response_hook__ (callable): The given callback uses the response returned from the service.* __raw_request_hook__ (callable): The given callback uses the request before being sent to service.* __client_request_id__ (str): Optional user specified identification of the request.* __user_agent__ (str): Appends the custom value to the user-agent header to be sent with the request.* __logging_enable__ (bool): Enables logging at the DEBUG level. Defaults to False. Can also be passed in atthe client level to enable it for all requests.* __logging_body__ (bool): Enables logging the request and response body. Defaults to False. Can also be passed in atthe client level to enable it for all requests.* __headers__ (dict): Pass in custom headers as key, value pairs. E.g. `headers={'CustomValue': value}`## Troubleshooting### GeneralDataLake Storage clients raise exceptions defined in [Azure Core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/README.md).This list can be used for reference to catch thrown exceptions. To get the specific error code of the exception, use the `error_code` attribute, i.e, `exception.error_code`.### LoggingThis library uses the standard[logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) library for logging.Basic information about HTTP sessions (URLs, headers, etc.) is logged at INFOlevel.Detailed DEBUG level logging, including request/response bodies and unredactedheaders, can be enabled on a client with the `logging_enable` argument:```pythonimport sysimport loggingfrom azure.storage.filedatalake import DataLakeServiceClient# Create a logger for the 'azure.storage.filedatalake' SDKlogger = logging.getLogger('azure.storage')logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)# Configure a console outputhandler = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)logger.addHandler(handler)# This client will log detailed information about its HTTP sessions, at DEBUG levelservice_client = DataLakeServiceClient.from_connection_string(&quot;your_connection_string&quot;, logging_enable=True)```Similarly, `logging_enable` can enable detailed logging for a single operation,even when it isn't enabled for the client:```pythonservice_client.list_file_systems(logging_enable=True)```## Next steps### More sample codeGet started with our [Azure DataLake samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-file-datalake/samples).Several DataLake Storage Python SDK samples are available to you in the SDK's GitHub repository.
