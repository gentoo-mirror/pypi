	<longdescription>====================PyAMS portal package====================.. contents::What is PyAMS?==============PyAMS (Pyramid Application Management Suite) is a small suite of packages written for applicationsand content management with the Pyramid framework.**PyAMS** is actually mainly used to manage web sites through content management applications (CMS,see PyAMS_content package), but many features are generic and can be used inside any kind of webapplication.All PyAMS documentation is available on `ReadTheDocs &lt;https://pyams.readthedocs.io&gt;`_; source codeis available on `Gitlab &lt;https://gitlab.com/pyams&gt;`_ and pushed to `Github&lt;https://github.com/py-ams&gt;`_. Doctests are available in the *doctests* source folder.What is PyAMS portal?=====================PyAMS_portal is a PyAMS extension package which can be used to handle presentation templates.A template is made of rows, slots and portlets, following Bootstrap's grid logic, andcan be shared between several contexts to handle content presentation. A context can then beconfigured to use distinct templates for page header, body and footer; when reusing a sharedtemplate, the template configuration of rows and slots is frozen, but each portlet can use adifferent configuration from those of the template from which we inherit.PyAMS_portal package only provides a very small set of portlets. More portlets are provided bycontent management packages like PyAMS_content, while other extension packages can be used toprovide custom portlets renderers.Changelog=========1.9.1----- - updated doctests1.9.0----- - added slot CSS class to portlets container - updated portlet previewer - updated portlet edit form status - bypass workflow state check on page preview1.8.1----- - use new sortable table base class1.8.0----- - added marker interfaces to handle header and footer templates1.7.1----- - corrected history syntax error1.7.0----- - added attribute to portlet settings to define Bootstrap devices on which portlet   is visible1.6.2----- - added default portlet settings label adapter - removed useless portlets renderers settings adapters - updated portlet settings preview templates1.6.1----- - updated doctests1.6.0----- - added support for distinct header, body and footer templates in a portlet context - added support for Python 3.11 - added renderer to spacer portlet1.5.2----- - updated doctests1.5.1----- - include required Fanstatic resources when portlet content is loaded from cache - add request protocol to portlets cache key1.5.0----- - added default portlet previewer - added no-value message to renderer selection widget - removed static resources from layout template - small refactoring in raw code portlet renderers - added *field* and *context* arguments to properties renderers in portlet preview - use f-strings instead of format functions (requires Python &gt;= 3.7) - updated translations - added support for Python 3.101.4.4----- - remove empty portlets from portal layout - use new ZMI base columns classes in cards and carousel portlets management views1.4.3----- - added link to image preview in image portlet1.4.2----- - restored missing callback in template layout1.4.1----- - updated MyAMS module registration - updated renderer selection widget classname - use new context base add action1.4.0----- - added prefix and suffix HTML codes to slot configuration1.3.3----- - added option to display menu to access templates container from ZMI home page1.3.2----- - added check for missing portlet renderer in preview - updated translation string name in layout management script1.3.1----- - updated content provider rendering API, adding new &quot;template_name&quot; argument to   &quot;render&quot; methods1.3.0----- - added template container CSS class (with custom TALES extension and updated layout) - added support for designer role to portal templates container - added template properties edit form - updated doctests1.2.3----- - small template layout CSS updates - added templates label adapter - updated add and edit forms title1.2.2----- - package version mismatch1.2.1----- - updated portlets inner settings forms label - use IObjectLabel adapter in local template share form1.2.0----- - added Bootstrap float classes to slots - updated Javascript layout handler1.1.0----- - added feature to create a shared template from a local one - removed permission on default portlets - updated forms title - updated translations1.0.4----- - clear portlets cache after configuration or renderer settings update1.0.3----- - updated layout offset classes for XS devices1.0.2----- - corrected syntax error in image portlet setting - updated ZMI modules exclusion rule when including package1.0.1----- - Javascript code cleanup1.0.0----- - initial release</longdescription>
