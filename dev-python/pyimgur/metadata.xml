	<longdescription>.. begin_introPyImgur=======.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/pyimgur.svg    :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/pyimgurThe simple way of using Imgur.You can upload images, download images, read comments, update your albums,message people and more. In fact, you can do almost everything via PyImgur thatyou can via the webend... end_intro.. begin_installationInstallation------------The recommended way to install is via `pip &lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip&gt;`_.. code-block:: bash   $ pip install pyimgur.. end_installation.. begin_getting_startedGetting Started---------------Before we can start using PyImgur, we need to register our application withImgur. This way, Imgur can see what each application is doing on their site.Go to https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient to register your client. Note thatyou can't use an application registration for the old v2 version of the ImgurAPI, which was depreciated December 2012.When we registered our application we got a ``client_id`` and a``client_secret``. The ``client_secret`` is used for authenticating as a user,if we just need access to public or anonymous resources, then we can leave itout. For our first example we're going to get some information about an imagealready uploaded to image::    import pyimgur    CLIENT_ID = &quot;Your_applications_client_id&quot;    im = pyimgur.Imgur(CLIENT_ID)    image = im.get_image('S1jmapR')    print(image.title) # Cat Ying &amp; Yang    print(image.link) # http://imgur.com/S1jmapR.jpgThe ``Imgur`` object keeps the authentication information, changesauthentication and is the common way to get objects from Imgur.Uploading an Image------------------Let's use another example to show how to upload an image::    import pyimgur    CLIENT_ID = &quot;Your_applications_client_id&quot;    PATH = &quot;A Filepath to an image on your computer&quot;    im = pyimgur.Imgur(CLIENT_ID)    uploaded_image = im.upload_image(PATH, title=&quot;Uploaded with PyImgur&quot;)    print(uploaded_image.title)    print(uploaded_image.link)    print(uploaded_image.size)    print(uploaded_image.type)Some methods here one or more arguments with the default value ``None``. Formethods modifying existing objects, this mean to keep the already existingvalue. For methods not modifying existing objects, this mean to use the Imgurdefault.Lazy objects------------To reduce the load on Imgur, PyImgur only requests the data it needs. Thismeans each object has the attribute ``_has_fetched`` which if ``True``` hasfetched all the data it can, if ``False`` it can fetch more information.Whenever we request an attribute that hasn't been loaded the newest informationwill be requested from Imgur and all the object attributes will be updated tothe newest values. We can also use the method ``refresh()`` to force a call toImgur, that will update the object with the latest values::    import pyimgur    CLIENT_ID = &quot;Your_applications_client_id&quot;    im = pyimgur.Imgur(CLIENT_ID)    gallery_image = im.get_gallery_image('JiAaT')    author = gallery_image.author    print(author._has_fetched) # False ie. it's a lazily loaded object    print(author.reputation)    print(author._has_fetched) # True ie. all values have now been retrieved.Introspection-------------Remember that as usual you can use the ``dir``, ``vars`` and ``help`` builtinfunctions to introspect objects to learn more about them and how they work.Mashape API-----------Imgur supports commercial use via Mashape, which uses a different endpoint andsome additional authentication. You can enable this easily by providing yourMashape key on initialization of the Imgur object::    import pyimgur    CLIENT_ID = &quot;Your_applications_client_id&quot;    MASHAPE_KEY = &quot;Your_mashape_api_key&quot;    im = pyimgur.Imgur(CLIENT_ID, mashape_key=MASHAPE_KEY)More information on Mashape's API and Pricing can be found on the `Mashapewebsite &lt;https://market.mashape.com/imgur/imgur-9&gt;`_.Support-------If you find an bug, have any questions about how to use PyImgur or havesuggestions for improvements then feel free to file an issue on the `Githubproject page &lt;https://github.com/Damgaard/PyImgur&gt;`_.Documentation-------------PyImgur's full documentation is located on `ReadTheDocs&lt;https://pyimgur.readthedocs.org&gt;`_.License-------All of the code contained here is licensed by`the GNU GPLv3 &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html&gt;`_... end_getting_started</longdescription>
