	<longdescription>cliquery |PyPI Version| |Total Downloads|=========================================a command-line browser interface--------------------------------cliquery cuts down on clicking through command-line web searching, pagepreviewing, and page bookmarking, among other features. An interactiveprompt allows users to easily make successive queries and enter programflags dynamically; simply typing help will list all possible flags toenter. Opening a link will invoke a browser supplied by the user ordetected automatically across Windows, OSX, and Linux platforms.Installation------------::    pip install cliquery --useror::    pip install git+https://github.com/huntrar/cliquery.git#egg=cliquery --useror::    git clone https://github.com/huntrar/cliquery    cd cliquery    python setup.py install --userIf you encounter issues installing lxml, see`here &lt;http://lxml.de/installation.html&gt;`__.It is advised to copy the blank .cliqrc into .local.cliqrc, as .cliqrcwill be emptied after a program update. To do this, enter the following:::    cd &quot;$(dirname &quot;$(cliquery -c)&quot;)&quot; &amp;&amp; cp .cliqrc .local.cliqrcRecommended (optional) setup----------------------------Configuration setup is completely optional but will improve your experience.This includes integrating Google Custom Search, WolframAlpha, and/or selection of browser choice.The browser invoked is selected implicitly by the webbrowser module.To explicitly choose your browser, set the name in .local.cliqrcunder 'browser' or set the BROWSER environment variable on your system.For best results, sign up for a `Google Custom Search API key &lt;https://code.google.com/apis/console&gt;`__This defaults search to Google, otherwise results will come from Bing.The instructions are as follows:Upon signing into Google, click on API Manager, then Credentials, andcreate an API key. Enter this under the 'google\_api\_key' field in.cliqrc.Next, `create a custom search engine &lt;https://cse.google.com/all&gt;`__.You must choose at least one site to search during creation (I chosestackoverflow.com), but to search the entire web you must click on thisnew search engine, go to Setup, then Basics, and select 'Search theentire web but emphasize included sites.' Then you may choose to keep ordelete the site you originally provided.After creating a custom search engine, click on the engine, go to Setup,and under Details click Search engine ID. Enter this under the'google\_engine\_key' field.For WolframAlpha usage, sign up for a `WolframAlpha API key &lt;https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html&gt;`__Enter your key under the 'wolfram\_api\_key' field.Users may also import Firefox or Chrome bookmarks into .cliqrc byexporting the bookmarks to HTML and importing to cliquery with the -iflag. The imported bookmarks will be added to your existing bookmarks,which may result in duplicates.Usage-----::    usage: cliquery.py [-h] [-b] [-c] [-C] [-d] [-e] [-f] [-i [IMPORT]] [-o] [-p]                       [-s] [-v] [-w]                       [QUERY [QUERY ...]]    a command-line browser interface    positional arguments:      QUERY                 keywords to search    optional arguments:      -h, --help            show this help message and exit      -b, --bookmark        view and modify bookmarks      -c, --config          print config file location      -C, --clear-cache     clear the cache      -d, --describe        summarize links      -e, --edit            edit config file      -f, --first           open first link      -i [IMPORT], --import [IMPORT]                            import bookmarks from file      -o, --open            directly open links      -p, --print           print links to stdout      -s, --search          search for links      -v, --version         display current version      -w, --wolfram         search WolframAlphaAuthor-------  Hunter Hammond (huntrar@gmail.com)Notes------  NOTE: If you receive the following message (or similar) when trying   to modify bookmarks:   ::       IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cliquery/.cliqrc'   This means you did not follow the install advice and chose to install as root. You have three options:   ::       1. (recommended) Uninstall and reinstall as a non-root user by following the instructions above.       2. Change the configuration file ownership from root to user by entering the following:               sudo chown $USER &quot;$(cliquery -c)&quot;        2. (not recommended) Execute cliquery as root, using su or sudo.-  A search may return immediate results, such as calculations or facts   made possible by WolframAlpha, or instead a page of Google search   results comprised of links and their descriptions.-  Interactive usage allows the user to continue making new queries by   dynamically executing new program flags and/or queries. Entering h or   help will list all possible prompt commands.   ::       + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +       1. Guido van Rossum - Official Site       2.

[Press Enter to continue..]-  To choose multiple links at once, a range may be specified by   separating the start and end range with a dash. Leaving one end of   the range blank will choose all links until the other end of that   range. For example, given 10 links, entering 5- would effectively be   the same as entering 5-10.-  Requests cache is enabled by default to cache webpages, it can be   disabled by setting the environment variable CLIQ\_DISABLE\_CACHE.-  Using the bookmark flag with no arguments will list all current   bookmarks in .cliqrc, naturally ordered by time of entry. Entering   help with the flag will list all possible commands including open,   add, remove, tag/untag (for aliasing), describe, and move. Bookmarks   like other flags may be entered during runtime in the link prompt.-  Additional arguments may be appended to bookmarks while opening them.   These are interpreted as any non-integer arguments which are not   found in any bookmarks (URLs or tags)... |PyPI Version| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cliquery.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cliquery.. |Total Downloads| image:: https://pepy.tech/badge/cliquery   :target: https://pepy.tech/project/cliquery</longdescription>
