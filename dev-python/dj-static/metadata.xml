	<longdescription>dj-static~~~~~~~~~This is a simple Django middleware utility that allows you to properlyserve static assets from production with a WSGI server like Gunicorn.Django `doesn't recommend &lt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/howto/static-files/#admonition-serving-the-files&gt;`_the production use of its static file server for a number of reasons.There exists, however, a lovely WSGI application aptly named `Static &lt;http://lukearno.com/projects/static/&gt;`_.It is suitable for the production use of static file serving, unlike Django.Usage-----Configure your static assets in ``settings.py``::   STATIC_ROOT = 'staticfiles'   STATIC_URL = '/static/'Then, update your ``wsgi.py`` file to use dj-static::    from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application    from dj_static import Cling    application = Cling(get_wsgi_application())</longdescription>
