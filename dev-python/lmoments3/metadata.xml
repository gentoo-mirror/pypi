	<longdescription>lmoments3=========A Python 3.x library to estimate linear moments for statistical distribution functions.Requires the packages `numpy` and `scipy`.For the Python 2.x compatible package see `lmoments` on the Python Package Index.Installation------------lmoments3 can be installed via `pip`.. code-block:: console    $ pip install lmoments3Documentation-------------Documentation is available on `Read the Docs &lt;http://lmoments3.readthedocs.io/latest&gt;`_.Source code can be found at `GitHub &lt;https://github.com/OpenHydrology/lmoments3&gt;`_.Origin------This package contains a Python 3.x implementation of the lmoments.f library created by J. R. M. Hosking.
