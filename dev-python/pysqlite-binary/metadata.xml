	<longdescription># pysqlite3This library takes the SQLite module from Python 3 and packages it as aseparately-installable module. The binary package is statically compiledwhich make it easy to embedded the library in certain circumstances.This may be useful for creating SQLite modules capable of working with otherversions of SQLite (via the amalgamation option). Meanwhile, the included SQLitelibrary is compiled with **all features enabled**, that user may benefit frommore features, like the score based database FTS (Full-Text Search).Additional features:* User-defined window functions (requires SQLite &gt;= 3.25)* Flags and VFS an be specified when opening connection* Incremental BLOB I/O, [bpo-24905](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/271)* Improved error messages, [bpo-16379](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/1108)* Simplified detection of DML statements via `sqlite3_stmt_readonly`.* Sqlite native backup API (also present in standard library 3.7 and newer).A completely self-contained binary package (wheel) is available for versions0.4.1 and newer as `pysqlite3-binary`. This package contains the latest releaseof SQLite compiled with numerous extensions, and requires no externaldependencies.Building with System SQLite---------------------------To build `pysqlite3` linked against the system SQLite, run:```$ python setup.py build```Building a statically-linked library------------------------------------To build `pysqlite3` statically-linked against a particular version of SQLite,you need to obtain the SQLite3 source code and copy `sqlite3.c` and `sqlite3.h`into the source tree.```# Download the latest release of SQLite source code and build the source# amalgamation files (sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h).$ wget https://www.sqlite.org/src/tarball/sqlite.tar.gz?r=release \    -O sqlite.tar.gz$ tar xzf sqlite.tar.gz$ cd sqlite/$ ./configure$ make sqlite3.c# Copy the sqlite3 amalgamation files into the root of the pysqlite3 checkout# and run build_static + build:$ cp sqlite/sqlite3.[ch] pysqlite3/$ cd pysqlite3$ python setup.py build_static build```You now have a statically-linked, completely self-contained `pysqlite3`.Using the binary package------------------------A binary package (wheel) is available for linux with a completelyself-contained  `pysqlite3`, statically-linked against the most recent releaseof SQLite.```$ pip install pysqlite3-binary```</longdescription>
