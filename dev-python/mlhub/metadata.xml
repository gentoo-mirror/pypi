	<longdescription>The Machine Learning Hub========================A *Command Line* framework and platform for presenting and utilisingMachine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Sciencecapabilities.Introduction------------The [machine learning hub](https://mlhub.ai) is a free and open sourceproject hosted on [github](https://github.com/mlhubber/mlhub) aimed ateasily sharing [machine learning, artificial intelligence, and datascience models and technologies](https://github.com/mlhubber/mlmodels). Thesource code for such models will be found on[github](https://github.com), [gitlab](https://gitlab.com), or[bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org). The models are installed andmanaged using the *ml* command from the *mlhub* package designed toinstall the model and run a demonstration within 5 minutes, as well asproviding a suite of useful command line tools based on the pre-builtmodels. Each model has been tested on Ubuntu (GNU/Linux).A number of demonstration models have been packaged and are listed inthe [repository index](https://mlhub.ai/Packages.html) on[mlhub.ai](https://mlhub.ai/) where the models themselves can bebrowsed.In this blog post we first review how to get started with MLHub andthen illustrate some of its functionality. See the growingdocumentation at the [GNU/Linux SurvivalGuide](https://togaware.com/linux/survivor/AI_Machine.html).Quick Start-----------The command line interface can be installed using[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mlhub/):    $ pip3 install mlhubOnce installed you will be able to run any curated or other model. The quickstart version is below. Note that you type the command `ml ...` andthat everything from the `#` to the end of the line is ignored (it'sa comment):    $ ml install &lt;model&gt; # Install the named model.    $ ml demo    &lt;model&gt; # Run the demonstration of the model.    $ ml gui     &lt;model&gt; # Graphical display to utilise the mode.The following commands are available and below is a brief description ofeach command:    $ ml                # Show a usage message.    $ ml available      # List of pre-buld models on the MLHub.    $ ml installed      # List of pre-built models installed locally    $ ml install   &lt;model&gt; # Install the model named 'rain'.    $ ml configure &lt;model&gt; # Install required dependencies.    $ ml readme    &lt;model&gt; # View background information about the model.    $ ml commands  &lt;model&gt; # List of commands supported by the model.    $ ml demo      &lt;model&gt; # Run the demonstration of the model    $ ml gui       &lt;model&gt; # Graphical display of pre-built model.    $ ml score     &lt;model&gt; # Run model on your own data.Different model packages will have different dependencies and these willbe installed by the *configure* command.Quick Start: Azure DSVM-----------------------A particularly attractive and simple way to get started with exploringthe mlhub functionality is to fire up a [Ubuntu Data Science VirtualMachine](https://aka.ms/dsvm) (DSVM) on Azure for as little as USD10 permonth for quite a small server or USD90 for a reasonable one. You canget free credit (USD200) from Microsoft to [trial theDSVM](https://aka.ms/free).Using this virtual machine will save a lot of time compared with settingup your own machine with the required dependencies, which of course youcan do if you wish as all the dependencies are open source.To set up the virtual machine, with an Azure subscription log in to the[portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and add a new Data Science VirtualMachine for Linux (Ubuntu). You need to provide a name (for the virtualmachine), a user name and a password, and then create a new resourcegroup and give it a name, and finally choose a location. Go with all thedefaults for everything else, except choose a size to suit the budget(B1s is cheap though a D2s is a better interactive experience). Notethat you are only charged whilst the machine is fired up so USD90 permonth is no where near what you will spend if you only fire up theserver when you need.Once the DSVM is set up go to its Overview page and click on DNS nameConfigure and provide a name by which to refer to the server publicly(e.g., myml.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com).We now have a server ready to showcase the pre-built Machine Learningmodels. There are several options to connect to the server but arecommended one is to use [X2Go](https://x2go.org/) which supportsLinux, Windows, and Mac. Install it and point it to your server (e.g.,myml.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com) in the setup.Connect to the DSVM. Close the Firefox window that pops up. Click on theterminal icon down the bottom, and you are ready to go:    $ pip install mlhub    $ ml    $ ml availableetc.Pre-Built Model Archives------------------------A model is a zip file archived as .mlm files and hosted in a repository.The public repository is [mlhub.ai](https://mlhub.ai/). The *ml* commandcan install the pre-built model locally, ready to run a demo, to printand display the model, and to score new data using the model. Somemodels provide ability to retrain the model with user provided data.Contributing Models to ML Hub-----------------------------Anyone is welcome to contribute a pre-built model package to ML Hub.Please submit a pull request through[github](https://github.com/mlhubber).Installing Pip3---------------On Ubuntu this is as simple as:    $ sudo apt install python3-pipAlternative pip Install-----------------------Depending on your setup of pip, you may need to use:    $ pip3 install mlhubThe executable may be placed into `~/.local/bin` which will need to beon your path. Edit your shell startup which is either `.profile` or`.bashrc`, etc:    PATH=&quot;$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH&quot;Alternative Install-------------------A tar.gz containing the mlhub package and the command line interface isavailable as[mlhub_3.7.0.tar.gz](https://mlhub.ai/dist/mlhub_3.7.0.tar.gz) withinthe [distribution folder](https://mlhub.ai/dist/) of the MLHub.To install from the tar.gz file:    $ wget https://mlhub.ai/dist/mlhub_3.7.0.tar.gz    $ pip install mlhub_3.7.0.tar.gz    $ mlOr extract the above downloaded .tar.gz and install:    $ wget https://mlhub.ai/dist/mlhub_3.7.0.tar.gz    $ tar xvf mlhub_3.7.0.tar.gz    $ cd mlhub    $ python3 setup.py install --userUnder Development-----------------An interactive MLHub session that is initiated through the democommand is quite similar to a Jupyter Notebook presentation running ontop of a Jupyter interpreter. Notebooks can be automaticallytransformed into a MLHub package so that the notebook becomes thesource for the interactive demo.py or demo.R script required byMLHub. In this way users have the choice to either run the Notebookinteractively within Jupyter or from the command line as aninteractive script.Contributions-------------The open source mlhub command line tool (ml) and sample models are beinghosted on [github](https://github.com/mlhubber) and contributions toboth the command line tool and contributions of new open sourcepre-built machine learning models are most welcome.
