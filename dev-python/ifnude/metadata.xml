	<longdescription># ifnudeIt is a nudity detection library that actually works, on both on humans and drawings.. It tells you exactly what NSFW parts of the body are visible. Optionally, you can censor the said parts.&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0KPJbl9.jpg&quot; width=600&gt;### Installation```bashpip install ifnude```### Example```pythonfrom ifnude import detect# use mode=&quot;fast&quot; for x3 speed with slightly lower accuracyprint(detect('/path/to/nsfw.png'))```#### Output```[{'box': [164, 188, 246, 271], 'score': 0.8253238201141357, 'label': 'EXPOSED_BREAST_F'}, {'box': [252, 190, 335, 270], 'score': 0.8235630989074707, 'label': 'EXPOSED_BREAST_F'}]```### CreditsThis is fork of [NudeNet](https://pypi.org/project/NudeNet/) library which doesn't work anymore. I have taken the liberty to remove the video detection functionality as it was prone to crashes. It will be re-implemented in future.</longdescription>
