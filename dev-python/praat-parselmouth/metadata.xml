	<longdescription># Parselmouth - Praat in Python, the Pythonic way**Parselmouth** is a Python library for the [Praat](http://www.praat.org)software.Though other attempts have been made at porting functionality from Praat toPython, Parselmouth is unique in its aim to provide a complete and Pythonicinterface to the internal Praat code. While other projects either wrap Praat'sscripting language or reimplementing parts of Praat's functionality in Python,Parselmouth directly accesses Praat's C/C++ code (which means the algorithmsand their output are exactly the same as in Praat) and provides efficientaccess to the program's data, but *also* provides an interface that looksno different from any other Python library.Drop by our [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/PraatParselmouth/Lobby) orpost a message to our[Google discussion group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/parselmouth) ifyou have any question, remarks, or requests!More information on the **installation** and some basic **examples**can be found on Parselmouth's GitHub repository:https://github.com/YannickJadoul/Parselmouth</longdescription>
