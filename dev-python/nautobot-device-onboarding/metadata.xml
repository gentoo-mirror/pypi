In some cases, the user may also have to specify a specific *Device Platform* and *Device Port*.Regardless, the Onboarding Plugin greatly simplifies the onboarding processby allowing the user to specify a small amount of info and having the plugin populate a much larger amount of device data in Nautobot.### Screenshots![Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-device-onboarding/develop/docs/images/onboarding_tasks_view.png)## Try it out!This App is installed in the Nautobot Community Sandbox found over at [demo.nautobot.com](https://demo.nautobot.com/)!&gt; For a full list of all the available always-on sandbox environments, head over to the main page on [networktocode.com](https://www.networktocode.com/nautobot/sandbox-environments/).## DocumentationFull web-based HTML documentation for this app can be found over on the [Nautobot Docs](https://docs.nautobot.com/) website:- [User Guide](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/device-onboarding/en/latest/user/app_overview/) - Overview, Using the App, Getting Started.- [Administrator Guide](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/device-onboarding/en/latest/admin/install/) - How to Install, Configure, Upgrade, or Uninstall the App.- [Developer Guide](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/device-onboarding/en/latest/dev/contributing/) - Extending the App, Code Reference, Contribution Guide.- [Release Notes / Changelog](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/device-onboarding/en/latest/admin/release_notes/).- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/device-onboarding/en/latest/user/faq/).### Contributing to the DocsYou can find all the Markdown source for the App documentation under the [docs](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-device-onboarding/tree/develop/docs) folder in this repository.
