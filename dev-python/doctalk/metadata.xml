	<longdescription># doctalkPython-based summary and keyword extractor and question answering system with optional BERT-based post-processing filter and spoken output##INSTALLSee the ```requirements.txt``` file if installing directly. To make an editable package locally, use```pip3 install -e .```To embed in a system as is, from ```pypi.org``` use```pip3 install -U doctalk```##USAGE:```python3 -i&gt;&gt;&gt; from doctalk.talk import run_with&gt;&gt;&gt; run_with(fname)&gt;&gt;&gt; from doctalk.think import reason_with&gt;&gt;&gt; reason_with(fname)```This activates dialog about document in ```&lt;fname&gt;.txt``` with questions in ```&lt;fname&gt;_quests.txt```See some examples at : [https://github.com/ptarau/pytalk](https://github.com/ptarau/pytalk) , where, after installing the system, you can run```python3 -i tests.py&gt;&gt;&gt; go()&gt;&gt;&gt; tgo()```  To run the system one will need to start the ```Stanford Corenlp Server```, listening on port ```9000``` with all annotators in params.py started, i.e., with something like:```java -mx16g -cp &quot;stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05/*&quot; edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer -preload tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,depparse,natlog,openie```To play with various parameter settings, edit the ```doctalk/params.py``` file.Please see the install hints for ```stanfordnlp```, that might involve torch binaries, and require anaconda on some systems.### Web AppTo use the included ``docboot``` Web app, after installing ```Flask``` and ```waitress```, run the ```app.py``` file in directory ```docbot``` with ```python3 app.py```. The docbot uses a JSON-based API, documented in ```doctalk/api.py```. In fact, this is the simplest way to integrate the summarizer and the dialog agent into a production system.</longdescription>
