	<longdescription># Richie, the best OpenSource CMS to build education portals[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/openfun/richie/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/openfun/richie/tree/master)## Overview`Learning Management Systems` (LMS) are great tools for hosting and playing interactive onlinecourses and MOOCs.However, if you need to build a complete website with flexible content to aggregate your courses,in several languages and from different sources, **you will soon need a CMS**.At &quot;France Université Numérique&quot;, we wanted to build an OpenSource portal with `Python` and`Django`. That's why we built `Richie` on top of [DjangoCMS](https://www.django-cms.org), one ofthe best CMS on the market, as a toolbox to easily create full fledged websites with a catalog ofonline courses.Among the features that `Richie` offers out of the box:- multi-lingual by default,- advanced access rights and moderation,- catalog of courses synchronized with one or more `LMS` instances,- search engine based on `Elasticsearch` and pre-configured to offer full-text queries,  multi-facetting, auto-complete,...- flexible custom pages for courses, organizations, categories, teachers, blog posts,  programs (and their inter-relations),- Extensible with any third-party `DjangoCMS` plugin or any third-party `Django` application.## Discover RichieIf you're looking for a quick preview of `Richie`, you can take a look and have a tour of`Richie` on our dedicated [demo site](https://demo.richie.education).It is connected back-to-back with a demo of OpenEdX running on[OpenEdX Docker](https://github.com/openfun/openedx-docker).Two users are available for testing:- admin: `admin@example.com`/`admin`- student: `edx@example.com`/`edx`The database is regularly flushed.## Getting startedTake a look at our [documentation](https://richie.education/docs/discover) to get started with Richie.## Contributing### [Contributing guide](https://richie.education/docs/contributing-guide)Read our [contributing guide](https://richie.education/docs/contributing-guide) to learn about our development process and get started developing on `Richie`.### LicenseThis work is released under the MIT License (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)).</longdescription>
