	<longdescription>=====================PyAMS elastic package=====================.. contents::What is PyAMS?==============PyAMS (Pyramid Application Management Suite) is a small suite of packages written for applicationsand content management with the Pyramid framework.**PyAMS** is actually mainly used to manage web sites through content management applications (CMS,see PyAMS_content package), but many features are generic and can be used inside any kind of webapplication.All PyAMS documentation is available on `ReadTheDocs &lt;https://pyams.readthedocs.io&gt;`_; source codeis available on `Gitlab &lt;https://gitlab.com/pyams&gt;`_ and pushed to `Github&lt;https://github.com/py-ams&gt;`_. Doctests are available in the *doctests* source folder.What is PyAMS elastic?======================PyAMS_elastic is an extension package for PyAMS to provide support for Elasticsearch; it's a forkof *pyramid_es* package, adapted to use last Elasticsearch features and Elasticsearch-DSL package(see `Elasticsearch &lt;https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io&gt;` and `Elasticsearch-DSL&lt;https://elasticsearch-dsl.readthedocs.io&gt;`). It is also using more components of the componentsarchitecture.Compared with *pyramid_es*, it's no more Python 2 compliant, and adds a few features likeaggregations support in Elasticsearch queries. Deprecated Elasticsearch features have also beenremoved from package.A PyAMS scheduler task info is also provided by this package; it allows running Elasticsearchqueries on a regular basis, and to send notifications if expected results are not received.Running PyAMS_elastic unit tests================================Unit tests relies on an &quot;elasticsearch&quot; entry to be used with Gitlab-CI services. If you want torun unit tests locally, you must have an entry in your &quot;hosts&quot; file pointing to your Elasticsearchserver.Changelog=========1.6.7----- - updated output of Elasticsearch re-indexation task - updated tasks docstrings1.6.6----- - updated translations1.6.5----- - use pagination and bulk API in Elasticsearch re-indexation task - replace 'body' parameter with named arguments1.6.4----- - restored all unit tests1.6.3----- - updated unit tests (still partially disabled!)1.6.2----- - disabled some unit tests because of strange behaviour with Gitlab's Docker1.6.1----- - updated re-indexation task status on failure1.6.0----- - added PyAMS scheduler task to handler partial Elasticsearch re-indexation - added support for PyAMS dynamic text formatters into Elasticsearch client index name1.5.2----- - restored deleted services in Gitlab CI configuration1.5.1----- - use new SQLAlchemy structure to get access to mappings registry - added support for Python 3.111.5.0----- - allow usage of dynamic text formatters into scheduler Elasticsearch tasks1.4.1----- - use new scheduler task execution status on failure1.4.0----- - added certificates management options when creating Elasticsearch client, available in   Pyramid configuration file1.3.1----- - updated CI for Python 3.101.3.0----- - added SSL settings to client configuration - added Elasticsearch update API support - allow overriding of configuration file settings with named arguments when creating   custom Elasticsearch client - added support for Python 3.101.2.1----- - remove some Elasticsearch (&gt; 7.15) deprecation warnings using named arguments1.2.0----- - use PyAMS_utils transaction manager1.1.0----- - updated task add and edit forms title - updated package include scan1.0.0----- - initial release</longdescription>
