  :target: https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/   :alt: Documentation StatusSageMaker Python SDK is an open source library for training and deploying machine learning models on Amazon SageMaker.With the SDK, you can train and deploy models using popular deep learning frameworks **Apache MXNet** and **TensorFlow**.You can also train and deploy models with **Amazon algorithms**,which are scalable implementations of core machine learning algorithms that are optimized for SageMaker and GPU training.If you have **your own algorithms** built into SageMaker compatible Docker containers, you can train and host models using these as well.For detailed documentation, including the API reference, see `Read the Docs &lt;https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io&gt;`_.Table of

and can be installed with pip as follows:::    pip install sagemakerYou can install from source by cloning this repository and running a pip install command in the root directory of the repository:::    git clone https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk.git    cd sagemaker-python-sdk    pip install .Supported Operating Systems~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~SageMaker Python SDK supports Unix/Linux and Mac.Supported Python Versions~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~SageMaker Python SDK is tested on:- Python 3.7- Python 3.8- Python 3.9- Python 3.10AWS Permissions~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~As a managed service, Amazon SageMaker performs operations on your behalf on the AWS hardware that is managed by Amazon SageMaker.Amazon SageMaker can perform only operations that the user permits.You can read more about which permissions are necessary in the `AWS Documentation &lt;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html&gt;`__.The SageMaker Python SDK should not require any additional permissions aside from what is required for using SageMaker.However, if you are using an IAM role with a path in it, you should grant permission for ``iam:GetRole``.Licensing~~~~~~~~~SageMaker Python SDK is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. It is copyright Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates. All Rights Reserved. The license is available at:http://aws.amazon.com/apache2.0/Running tests~~~~~~~~~~~~~SageMaker Python SDK has unit tests and integration tests.You can install the libraries needed to run the tests by running :code:`pip install --upgrade .[test]` or, for Zsh users: :code:`pip install --upgrade .\[test\]`**Unit tests**We run unit tests with tox, which is a program that lets you run unit tests for multiple Python versions, and also make sure thecode fits our style guidelines. We run tox with `all of our supported Python versions &lt;#supported-python-versions&gt;`_, so to run unit testswith the same configuration we do, you need to have interpreters for those Python versions installed.To run the unit tests with tox, run:::    tox tests/unit**Integration tests**To run the integration tests, the following prerequisites must be met1. AWS account credentials are available in the environment for the boto3 client to use.2. The AWS account has an IAM role named :code:`SageMakerRole`.   It should have the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess policy attached as well as a policy with `the necessary permissions to use Elastic Inference &lt;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ei-setup.html&gt;`__.We recommend selectively running just those integration tests you'd like to run. You can filter by individual test function names with:::    tox -- -k 'test_i_care_about'You can also run all of the integration tests by running the following command, which runs them in sequence, which may take a while:::    tox -- tests/integYou can also run them in parallel:::    tox -- -n auto tests/integGit Hooks~~~~~~~~~to enable all git hooks in the .githooks directory, run these commands in the repository directory:::    find .git/hooks -type l -exec rm {} \;    find .githooks -type f -exec ln -sf ../../{} .git/hooks/ \;To enable an individual git hook, simply move it from the .githooks/ directory to the .git/hooks/ directory.Building Sphinx docs~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Setup a Python environment, and install the dependencies listed in ``doc/requirements.txt``:::    # conda    conda create -n sagemaker python=3.7    conda activate sagemaker    conda install sphinx=3.1.1 sphinx_rtd_theme=0.5.0    # pip    pip install -r doc/requirements.txtClone/fork the repo, and install your local version:::    pip install --upgrade .Then ``cd`` into the ``sagemaker-python-sdk/doc`` directory and run:::    make htmlYou can edit the templates for any of the pages in the docs by editing the .rst files in the ``doc`` directory and then running ``make html`` again.Preview the site with a Python web server:::    cd _build/html    python -m http.server 8000View the website by visiting http://localhost:8000SageMaker SparkML Serving-------------------------With SageMaker SparkML Serving, you can now perform predictions against a SparkML Model in SageMaker.In order to host a SparkML model in SageMaker, it should be serialized with ``MLeap`` library.For more information on MLeap, see https://github.com/combust/mleap .Supported major version of Spark: 3.3 (MLeap version - 0.20.0)Here is an example on how to create an instance of  ``SparkMLModel`` class and use ``deploy()`` method to create anendpoint which can be used to perform prediction against your trained SparkML Model... code:: python    sparkml_model = SparkMLModel(model_data='s3://path/to/model.tar.gz', env={'SAGEMAKER_SPARKML_SCHEMA': schema})    model_name = 'sparkml-model'    endpoint_name = 'sparkml-endpoint'    predictor = sparkml_model.deploy(initial_instance_count=1, instance_type='ml.c4.xlarge', endpoint_name=endpoint_name)Once the model is deployed, we can invoke the endpoint with a ``CSV`` payload like this:.. code:: python    payload = 'field_1,field_2,field_3,field_4,field_5'    predictor.predict(payload)For more information about the different ``content-type`` and ``Accept`` formats as well as the structure of the``schema`` that SageMaker SparkML Serving recognizes, please see `SageMaker SparkML Serving Container`_... _SageMaker SparkML Serving Container: https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-sparkml-serving-container</longdescription>
