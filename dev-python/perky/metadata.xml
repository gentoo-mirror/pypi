Perky files are easy to write by hand.* Explicit minimal data type support.  Rather than guess at the types  of your data, Perky lets you handle the final transformation.* Lightweight, simple, and fast.  Perky's implementation is small  and straightforward.  Ignoring comments and test code, it's about  1k lines of Python.  Fewer lines means fewer bugs!  (Hopefully!)* Flexible and extensible.  Perky permits extending the semantics of  Perky files through a &quot;pragma&quot; mechanism.#### Perky syntaxPerky configuration files look something like JSON without thequoting.  It supports only a surprisingly small set of valuetypes:* strings, including quoted strings and  &quot;triple-quoted strings&quot; (multi-line strings),* &quot;lists&quot; (arrays),* and &quot;dicts&quot; (associative arrays).Perky is line-oriented; individual values go on a singleline.  Container objects use one line per internal value.You may nest lists and dicts as deeply as memory permits.Unlike Python itself, leading whitespace is ignored.  Youare free to use leading whitespace to show structure butthis is optional.Blank lines and comment lines (lines starting with `#`)are ignored.Perky also supports &quot;pragmas&quot;, which are lines that startwith an equals sign.  By default Perky doesn't define anypragmas--it's an extension mechanism for your use.Here's a sample Perky configuration file exercising allthe things you can do in Perky:    example name = value    example dict = {        name = 3        another name = 5.0        }    example list = [        a        b        c        ]    nested dict = {        name = value        nesting level 2 = {            nesting level 3 = {                and = so on!                }            }        list inside the dict = [            value in the list                [                and this is in a nested list!                this is another value.                you see?                ]            ]        }    # lines starting with hash are comments and are ignored!    # blank lines are ignored too!    &quot; quoted name &quot; = &quot; quoted value &quot;    triple quoted string = &quot;&quot;&quot;        indenting            is preserved        the string is automatically outdented        to the leftmost character of the *ending*        triple-quote        &lt;-- aka here        &quot;&quot;&quot;    one-line empty list = []    one-line empty dict = {}    one-line empty list with whitespace = [ ]    one-line empty dict with whitespace = { }    multi-line empty list = [        ]    multi-line empty dict = {        }    =pragma    =pragma with argument#### Explicit transformation is better than implicitOne possibly-surprising design choice of Perky: the onlynatively supported values for the Perky parser are dicts,lists, and strings.  Other commonly-used types (ints, floats,etc) are handled using a different mechanism: _transformation._A Perky transformation takes a dict as input, and transformsthe contents of the dict based on a _schema_.  A Perky schemais a dict with the same general shape as the dict producedby the Perky parse, but it contains dicts, lists,and *transformation functions*.If you want *myvalue* in `{'myvalue':'3'}` to be a real integer,transform it with the schema `{'myvalue': int}`.Note that Perky doesn't care how or if you transform yourdata.  You can use it as-is, or transform it, or transformit with multiple passes.  You don't even need to use Perky'ssimple transformation mechanisms--you can ignore them completelyand use an external transformation library like[Marshmallow.](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/)### PragmasA *pragma* is a metadata directive for the Perky parser.It's a way of sending instructions to the Perky parser frominside a bit of Perky text.Here's an example pragma directive:`=command argument here`The first word after the equals sign is the name of the pragma, in this case `&quot;command&quot;`.Everything after the name of the pragma is an argument, with all leadingand trailing whitespace removed, in this case `&quot;argument here&quot;`.By default, Perky doesn't have any pragma handlers.  And invoking a pragmawhen Perky doesn't have a handler for it is a runtime error.But you can define your own pragma handlers when you call `perky.load()`or `perky.loads()`, using a named parameter called `pragmas`.If you pass in a value for `pragmas`, it must be a mappingof strings to functions.The string name should be the name of the pragma and must be lowercase.The function it maps to will &quot;handle&quot; that pragma, and should match thisprototype:`def pragma_fn(parser, argument)``parser` is the internal Perky `Parser` object.  `argument` is therest of the relevant line, with leading &amp; trailing whitespace stripped.(If the rest of the line was empty, `argument` will be `None`).The return value of the pragma function is ignored.There's currently only one predefined pragma handler, a function called`perky.pragma_include()`.  This adds &quot;include statement&quot; functionalityto Perky.  If you call this:`perky.load(filename, pragmas={'include': perky.pragma_include()})`then Perky will interpret lines inside `filename` starting with `=include`as include statements, using the rest of the line as the name of a file.For more information, see `pragma_include()` below.The rules of pragmas:* To invoke a pragma, use `=` as the first non-whitespace character  on a line.* The names of pragmas must always be lowercase.* You can't invoke a pragma inside a triple-quoted string.* Pragmas can be &quot;context-sensitive&quot;: they can be aware of where  they are run inside a file, and e.g. modify the current dict  or list.  The pragma function can see the entire current nested  list of dicts and lists being parsed (via `parser.breadcrumbs`).* The rest of the line after the name of the pragma is the  pragma argument value, if any.  This is always a string.  It can  be a quoted string.### Parsing ErrorsThere are only a few errors possible when parsing a Perky text:* Obviously, syntax errors, for example:    * A line in a dict that doesn't have an unquoted equals sign    * A line in a list that looks like a dict line (`name = value`).      (If you want a value like that inside a list, simply put it in quotes.)    * A triple-quoted string where any line is outdented past      the ending triple quotes line.* Defining the same value twice in the same dict.  This is flagged  as an error, because it could easily be a mistake, and in Python  we don't want to let errors pass silently.* Using an undefined pragma.* Using one of Perky's special tokens as a pragma argument, like  `{`, `[`, `'''`, `&quot;&quot;&quot;`, `[]`, or `{}`.### API`perky.loads(s, *, pragmas=None) -&gt; d`Parses a string containing Perky-file-format settings.Returns a dict.`perky.load(filename, *, pragmas=None, encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;) -&gt; d`Parses a file containing Perky-file-format settings.Returns a dict.`perky.dumps(d) -&gt; s`Converts a dictionary to a Perky-file-format string.Keys in the dictionary must all be strings.  Valuesthat are not dicts, lists, or strings will be convertedto strings using str.Returns a string.`perky.dump(filename, d, *, pragmas=None, encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;)`Converts a dictionary to a Perky-file-format stringusing `perky.dump`, then writes it to *filename*.`perky.pragma_include(include_path=(&quot;.&quot;,))`This function generates a pragma handler that adds &quot;include&quot;functionality.  &quot;Including&quot; means lexically inserting one Perkyfile inside another, contextually at the spot where the pragmaexists.For example:    d = perky.loads(&quot;a=3\n&quot; &quot;=include data.pky\n&quot; &quot;c=5\n&quot;,        pragmas={&quot;include&quot;: perky.pragma_include()},        )If *data.pky* contained the following:    b=4then `d` would be set to the dictionary:    {'a': '3', 'b': '4', 'c': '5'}`perky.pragma_include()` is not the pragma handler itself;it returns a function (a closure) which remembers the `include_path`you pass in.  This allows you to use it for multiple pragmas thatinclude from different paths, e.g.:    include_dirs = [appdirs.user_data_dir(myapp_name)]    config_dirs = [appdirs.user_config_dir(myapp_name)]    pragmas = {        'include': perky.pragma_include(include_dirs),        'config': perky.pragma_include(config_dirs),    }Notes:* The pragma handler is context-sensitive; the includedfile will be included as if it was copied-and-pasted replacingthe pragma line.  Among other things, this means that if the pragmais invoked inside a list context, the included file must *start*in a list context.* When loading the file, the pragma handler will pass in thecurrent pragma handlers into `perky.load()`.  Among other things,this allows for recursive includes.* When including inside a dict context, you're explicitly permittedto re-define existing keys if they were previously defined inanother file.* The default value for `include_path` only searches thecurrent directory (`&quot;.&quot;`).  If you override the defaultand pass in your own include path, the pragma handlerwon't search the current directory unless you add `&quot;.&quot;`to the include path yourself.`perky.map(d, fn) -&gt; o`Iterates over a dictionary.  Returns a new dictionary where,for every *value*:  * if it is a dict, replace with a new dict.  * if it is a list, replace with a new list.  * if it is neither a dict nor a list, replace with    `fn(value)`.The function passed in is called a *conversion function*.`perky.transform(d, schema, default=None) -&gt; o`Recursively transforms a Perky dict into some otherobject (usually a dict) using the provided schema.Returns a new dict.A *schema* is a data structure matching the general expectedshape of *d*, where the values are dicts, lists, andcallables.  The transformation is similar to `perky.map()`except that individual values will have individual conversionfunctions.  Also, a schema conversion function can be specifiedfor any value in *d*, even dicts or lists.*default* is a default conversion function.  If there is avalue *v* in *d* that doesn't have an equivalent entry in *schema*,and *v* is neither a list nor a dict, and if *default* isa callable, *v* will be replaced with `default(v)` in theoutput.`perky.Required`Experimental.`perky.nullable(fn) -&gt; fn`Experimental.`perky.const(fn) -&gt; o`Experimental.### TODO* Backslash quoting currently does &quot;whatever your version of Python does&quot;.  Perhaps this should be explicit, and parsed by Perky itself?</longdescription>
