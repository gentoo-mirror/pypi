This framework utilisesgraphical causal inference (CI) techniques for the specification and functional testing of software from a black-boxperspective. In this framework, we use causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to express the anticipated cause-effectrelationships amongst the inputs and outputs of the system-under-test and the supporting mathematical framework todesign statistical procedures capable of making causal inferences. Each causal test case focuses on the causal effect ofan intervention made to the system-under test. That is, a prescribed change to the input configuration of thesystem-under-test that is expected to cause a change to some output(s).![Causal Testing Workflow](images/workflow.png)## InstallationSee the readthedocs site for [installationinstructions](https://causal-testing-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).## DocumentationFurther information on causal inference, the code, usage and more can be found on the [docs](https://causal-testing-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)</longdescription>
