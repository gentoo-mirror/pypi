It isespecially suitable for long reads, but works also well with short reads.Features========  * Very accurate results (Martin et al.,    `WhatsHap: fast and accurate read-based phasing &lt;https://doi.org/10.1101/085050&gt;`_)  * Works well with Illumina, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore and other types of reads  * It phases SNVs, indels and even “complex” variants (such as ``TCG`` → ``AGAA``)  * Pedigree phasing mode uses reads from related individuals (such as trios)    to improve results and to reduce coverage requirements    (Garg et al., `Read-Based Phasing of Related Individuals &lt;https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw276&gt;`_).  * WhatsHap is easy to install  * It is easy to use: Pass in a VCF and one or more BAM files, get out a phased VCF.    Supports multi-sample VCFs.  * It produces standard-compliant VCF output by default  * If desired, get output that is compatible with ReadBackedPhasing  * Open Source (MIT license)Documentation-------------* `GitHub repository &lt;https://github.com/whatshap/whatshap/&gt;`_* `Read the documentation online &lt;https://whatshap.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_.
