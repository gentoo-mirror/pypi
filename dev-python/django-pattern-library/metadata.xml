Try our [online demo](https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/demo/).![Screenshot of the pattern library UI, with navigation, pattern rendering, and configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torchbox/django-pattern-library/main/.github/pattern-library-screenshot.webp)## FeaturesThis package automates the maintenance of UI pattern libraries or styleguides for Django projects, and allows developers to experiment with Django templates without having to create Django views and models.- Create reusable patterns by creating Django templates files as usual.- All patterns automatically show up in the pattern library’s interface.- Define data as YAML files for the templates to render with the relevant Django context.- Override Django templates tags as needed to mock the template’s dependencies.- Document your patterns with Markdown.## Why you need thisPattern libraries will change your workflow for the better:- They help separate concerns, both in code, and between members of a development team.- If needed, they make it possible for UI development to happen before models and views are created.- They encourage code reuse – defining independent UI components, that can be reused across apps, or ported to other projects.- It makes it much simpler to test UI components – no need to figure out where they’re used across a site or app.Learn more by watching our presentation – [Reusable UI components: A journey from React to Wagtail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isrOufI7TKc).## Online demoThe pattern library is dependent on Django for rendering – but also supports exporting as a static site if needed. Try out our online demo:- For a component, [accordion.html](https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/demo/pattern/patterns/molecules/accordion/accordion.html)- For a page-level template, [person_page.html](https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/demo/pattern/patterns/pages/people/person_page.html)## DocumentationDocumentation is available at [torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library](https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/), with source files in the `docs` directory.- **[Getting started](https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/getting-started/)**- **Guides**  - [Defining template context](https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/guides/defining-template-context/)  - [Overriding template tags](https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/guides/overriding-template-tags/)  - [Customizing template rendering](https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/guides/customizing-template-rendering/)  - [Usage tips](https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/guides/usage-tips/)- **Reference**  - [API &amp; settings](https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/reference/api/)  - [Known issues and limitations](https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/reference/known-issues/)## ContributingSee anything you like in here?

Note we make no guarantee as to the quality of those pre-releases, and the pre-releases are overwritten on every build so shouldn’t be relied on for reproducible builds.
