	<longdescription>Adjutant is a service that sits along Keystone and allows theautomation and approval of tasks normally requiring a user with anadmin role. Adjutant allows defining of such tasks as part of aworkflow which can either be entirely automatic, or require adminapproval. The goal is to automate business logic, and augment thefunctionality of Keystone and other OpenStack services without gettingin the way of future OpenStack features or duplicating developmenteffort.Quick Dev Deployment====================To quickly deploy the service for testing you can install via pip,setup a default config file, and then run the test Django server.::    pip install adjutantThen running the service will look for a config in either**/etc/adjutant/conf.yaml** or it will default to **conf/conf.yaml**from the directory you run the command in.::    adjutant migrate    adjutant runserver &lt;port&gt;For now you will have to source the default conf from the github repoor the library install location itself, but we hope to add anadditional commandline function which will copy and setup a basicdefault config in **/etc/adjutant/conf.yaml**.</longdescription>
