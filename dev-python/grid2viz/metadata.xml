	<longdescription># Grid2Viz: The Grid2Op Visualization companion appGrid2Viz is a web application that offers several interactive views into the results of Reinforcement Learning agents that ran on the [Grid2Op](https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op) platform. It is part of the [GridAlive](https://github.com/rte-france/gridAlive) lab ecosystem.*   [0 Demo Gallery](#demo-gallery)*   [1 Documentation](#documentation)*   [2 Installation](#installation)*   [3 Run the application](#run-grid2viz)*   [4 Getting Started](#getting-started)*   [5 Caching](#caching)*   [6 Interface](#interface)*   [7 Contributing](#contributing)*   [8 Trouble shooting](#troubleshooting) ### Video highlighting Grid2viz analyzis capabilities[![Alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/xlqS-CzvMwk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlqS-CzvMwk)&lt;em&gt;Through this 10-minute video, the  behavior of best AI agents from [L2RPN NeurIPS competition](https://l2rpn.chalearn.org/competitions) is analyzed with Grid2viz under a very interesting and tense scenario.&lt;/em&gt;### Try it out in your browser with Heroku------------------**WAnt to reproduce the analysis of the video above !?** Give it a try in your own browser through this url: https://grid2viz-neurips.herokuapp.com/ ------------------## Demo Gallery&lt;!--- #[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mjothy/grid2viz/jupyter_dash?urlpath=lab)#if launching jupyter lab directly--&gt;You can otherwise launch a longer demo in your web navigator by running the Grid2viz_demo notebook through Binder by clicking the Binder button.

(default to False)```For example:```commandlinesource venv_grid2viz/bin/activategrid2viz --port 8000```&gt; **_WARNING_** Due to the caching operation the first run can take a while. All the agents present in the configuration fileswill be computed and then registered in cache. Depending on your agents it could take between 5 to 15min. You can follow the progress in the console.You can however generate all the cache over all agents and scenarios before end with `--cache=True````commandlinegrid2viz --port 8000 --agents_path AGENTS_PATH --n_cores Max_Cores --cache ```## Getting startedIn order to use this tool, you need to have serialized the RL process of grid2op. The expected file system is :- root_dir (agents_path)    - agent_1        - scenario_1        - scenario_2    - agent_2        - scenario_1        - scenario_2        - scenario_3Each of the scenario_* files have to contain all files given by serialisation of your RL through grid2op.In order to add a new agent to the app, you will have to add the agent's folder to this root_dirFor the update process of this folder chain, see the section `Caching` (in particular, when you want to overwrite the currentagents in root_dir with new versions with the same names)In the config.ini of this repo: - `agents_dir` is the path to your agents logs data directory. - `env_dir` is the path to the environment configuration directory. It contains a single file :    - coords.csv : The csv file that lists the coordinates of nodes in the networkChanging this config.ini file will require a restart of the server to update.Grid2Viz provide 2 agents with a scenario for one day and for one month available in `/grid2viz/data/agents` folder:- do-nothing-baseline- greedy-baselineBy default the config.ini is targeting these agents as well as the environment configuration folders.##  CachingThe cache system allows you to only compute long calculations of the app once per agent/scenario.The app will create a folder `_cache` in the `base_dir` of the config.ini which will contain these long calculations serialized.If you add a new folder in your `base_dir` (either an agent, or a scenario) you will have to restart the server so the appreads the folder tree again.**_WARNING_** : If you overwrite the agents while they were already cached, you will have to manually reset the cache so the appknows to compute everything again with the updated data. To do so, you just need to delete the `_cache` folder.## Interface#### Scenario SelectionThis page display up to 15 scenarios with for each one a brief summary using the best agent's performances.![scenario selection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjothy/grid2viz/master/grid2viz/assets/screenshots/scenario_selection.png &quot;Scenario Selection&quot;)#### Scenario OverviewOn this page are displayed the best agent's kpi to see his performances. It's also here that you can select an agent that willbe used as reference agent in the other pages to compare to the studied agents.![scenario overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjothy/grid2viz/master/grid2viz/assets/screenshots/scenario_overview.png &quot;Scenario Overview&quot;)#### Agent OverviewHere's displayed your reference agent's performances. You can select an agent to study to compare it with your reference via thedropdown on the page. The study agent selected will be used as study agent on the last page.In the *&quot;instant and cumulated reward&quot;* graph you can point timestep that will be use in the next page to studyaction in a specific timestep area.![agent overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjothy/grid2viz/master/grid2viz/assets/screenshots/agent_overview.png &quot;Agent Overview&quot;)#### Agent StudyThe Agent Study page will display kpi of your reference agent compared to your study agent on your selected timestep area.You will also see a summary of the previous page's kpi.![agent study](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjothy/grid2viz/master/grid2viz/assets/screenshots/agent_study.png &quot;Agent Study&quot;)## CONTRIBUTINGAs agent behavior analysis is still an active field of research and new ideas can come along the way, we welcome contributions to develop:*  new relevant visualizations (within grid2viz/grid2viz/src/kpi) *  new interactions (see nameOfTab_clbk.py) within the application*  existing feature improvements are also welcome.## Run the testsTo run the tests, execute the following command:```commandlinepython3 -m unittest discover --start-directory tests --buffer```## LimitationsThe app is still missing a couple features, namely a graph for visualising the flow through time, and the last line of the last screen, which will show all informations regarding the actions and observations at the selected timestep.The Actions KPIs and the distances as well as the topological action cluster &quot;object changed&quot; is in alpha feature. We will need some new features from the core API to finish these features.## Troubleshooting### MacOSSome mac users have been experimenting issues when lauching the app, raising the following message:`socket.gaierror: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known`The following steps might help you to overcome the issue:1. Open your terminal2. Type `echo $HOST` and copy the results3. Open the file `/etc/hosts` and make sure you include: &lt;br&gt; `127.0.0.1 PASTE RESULTS FROM echo $HOST`4. Save it and close it5. Launch grid2viz</longdescription>
