	<longdescription># Tenma DC power supply controllersProvides two basic controllers (tested on Linux) for a TENMA DC power supply via serial interface. Working on python 2.7 and python 3. * tenmaControl.py (tenma-control) (command line utility) * gtkIndicator.py (tenma-applet) (GTK indicator to sit on tray)# tenmaControl## What is this?A small command line program / library to setup a Tenma 72-XXXX DC POWER SUPPLY from your computer via SERIAL. Supports the following models with predefined limits:    * 72-2545 -&gt; Tested on HW (@kxtells)    * 72-2535 -&gt; Set as manufacturer manual (not tested)    * 72-2540 -&gt; Set as manufacturer manual (not tested)    * 72-2550 -&gt; Tested on HW (@kxtells)    * 72-2930 -&gt; Set as manufacturer manual (not tested)    * 72-2940 -&gt; Set as manufacturer manual (not tested)    * 72-13320 -&gt; Set as manufacturer manual (not tested)    * 72-13330 -&gt; Tested on HW (thomas-phillips-nz)Also, even if not described, should support [Koradkamodels](https://sigrok.org/wiki/Korad_KAxxxxP_series) and other Velleman unitswhich are just rebrandings of the same internals. Might need to set theappropiate `MATCH_STR` in the source code, feel free to open a PR if you testit in a known hardware unit.Originally, Coming back from holidays was hard. So I spent some time with alittle game setting up our power supply(tongue). You'll find a smallexplanation of the original code in:[https://jcastellssala.com/2017/10/31/tenma72-2540-linux-control/](https://jcastellssala.com/2017/10/31/tenma72-2540-linux-control/)## Installing### From pip    pip install tenma-serialpip install will leave `tenma-control` and `tenma-applet` in your PATH ready to use.### LocallyIt does not have many requirements, so you might just clone the repo and run it. install the required packages first.pip install -r requirements.txt## Usage examplesNote that it can be connected via a usb to serial cable, or directly with theprovided USB cable. In Linux it identifies the usb as `Bus 001 Device 015: ID0416:5011 Winbond Electronics Corp. Virtual Com Port `, running `dmesg` to getwhere the /dev/ttyACMX device registerd and pointing tenmaControl.py to thatdevice should work.any of the following examples can run via `tenma-control` or `tenmaControl.py`.### Print the Tenma versiontenmaControl.py /dev/ttyUSB0### Set the current and the voltageFor example: 2.2 Amperes 5V:tenmaControl.py -c 2200 -v 5000 /dev/ttyUSB0### Turn on the channel outputtenmaControl.py --on /dev/ttyUSB0### Turn OFF the channel outputtenmaControl.py --off /dev/ttyUSB0### Load an existing memorytenmaControl.py -r 1tenmaControl.py --recall 2### Create a new value for a memory 4tenmaControl.py -c 2200 -v 5000 --save 4 /dev/ttyUSB0### Print everythingtenmaControl.py -c 2200 -v 5000 --save 4 --verbose --debug /dev/ttyUSB0# tenma-applet gtkIndicatorA very simple GTK indicator to control a tenma DC power supply from a graphical desktop. Provides ON, OFF and RESET facilities. Simply start it with:    tenma-appletOr directly from the source code via:./gtkIndicator.py## Known Shortcomings: * The physical buttons are blocked for a while after connecting.</longdescription>
