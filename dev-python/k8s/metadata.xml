The library tries to provide an intuitive developer experience, rather than modelling the REST API directly. Our approach does not allow us to use Swagger to auto-generate a library that covers the entire API, but the parts we have implemented are (in our opinion) easier to work with than the client you get when using Swagger.Check out the tutorial_ to find out how to use the library, or the `developer guide`_ to learn how to extend the library to cover parts of the API we haven't gotten around to yet... _tutorial: http://k8s.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html.. _developer guide: http://k8s.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer.htmlChanges since last version--------------------------* `a864f3e`_: Follow up: adding status field for Application (`#117`_)* `e09a48b`_: Another Python 2 detail to remove* `eb8c130`_: Drop Python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 too, but add 3.8 to tests* `e76d771`_: Drop Python 2.7 support and clean up support code* `cc3dea3`_: Update requests to 2.31.0 to resolve security issue.. _eb8c130: https://github.com/fiaas/k8s/commit/eb8c130.. _e09a48b: https://github.com/fiaas/k8s/commit/e09a48b.. _e76d771: https://github.com/fiaas/k8s/commit/e76d771.. _#117: https://github.com/fiaas/k8s/issues/117.. _a864f3e: https://github.com/fiaas/k8s/commit/a864f3e.. _cc3dea3: https://github.com/fiaas/k8s/commit/cc3dea3</longdescription>
