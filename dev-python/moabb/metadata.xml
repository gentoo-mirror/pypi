In this project, we focus mostly onelectroencephalographic signals([EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography)), that is a very activeresearch domain, with worldwide scientific contributions. Still:- Reproducible Research in BCI has a long way to go.- While many BCI datasets are made freely available, researchers do not publish code, and  reproducing results required to benchmark new algorithms turns out to be trickier than  it should be.- Performances can be significantly impacted by parameters of the preprocessing steps,  toolboxes used and implementation “tricks” that are almost never reported in the  literature.As a result, there is no comprehensive benchmark of BCI algorithms, and newcomers arespending a tremendous amount of time browsing literature to find out what algorithm worksbest and on which dataset.### The solutionThe Mother of all BCI Benchmarks allows to:- Build a comprehensive benchmark of popular BCI algorithms applied on an extensive list  of freely available EEG datasets.- The code is available on GitHub, serving as a reference point for the future algorithmic  developments.- Algorithms can be ranked and promoted on a website, providing a clear picture of the  different solutions available in the field.This project will be successful when we read in an abstract “ … the proposed methodobtained a score of 89% on the MOABB (Mother of All BCI Benchmarks), outperforming thestate of the art by 5% ...”.## Installation### Pip installationTo use MOABB, you could simply do: \`pip install MOABB` \See [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) section if you have a problem.### Manual installationYou could fork or clone the repository and go to the downloaded directory, then run:1. install `poetry` (only once per machine):\   `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`\   or [checkout installation instruction](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) or   use [conda forge version](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/poetry)1. (Optional, skip if not sure) Disable automatic environment creation:\   `poetry config virtualenvs.create false`1. install all dependencies in one command (have to be run in the project directory):\   `poetry install`See [contributors' guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed explanation.### Requirements we useSee `pyproject.toml` file for full list of dependencies## Running### Verify InstallationTo ensure it is running correctly, you can also run```python -m unittest moabb.tests```once it is installed.### Use MOABBFirst, you could take a look at our [tutorials](./tutorials) that cover the most importantconcepts and use cases. Also, we have a several [examples](./examples/) available.You might be interested in [MOABB documentation][link_moabb_docs]### Moabb and dockerMoabb has a default image to run the benchmark. You have two options to download thisimage: build from scratch or pull from the docker hub. **We recommend pulling from thedocker hub**.If this were your first time using docker, you would need to **install the docker** and**login** on docker hub. We recommend the[official](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) docker documentationfor this step, it is essential to follow the instructions.After installing docker, you can pull the image from the docker hub:```bashdocker pull baristimunha/moabb# rename the tag to moabbdocker tag baristimunha/moabb moabb```If you want to build the image from scratch, you can use the following command at theroot. You may have to login with the API key in the[NGC Catalog](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/) to run this command.```bashbash docker/create_docker.sh```With the image downloaded or rebuilt from scratch, you will have an image called `moabb`.To run the default benchmark, still at the root of the project, and you can use thefollowing command:```bashmkdir datasetmkdir resultsmkdir outputbash docker/run_docker.sh PATH_TO_ROOT_FOLDER```An example of the command is:```bashcd /home/user/project/moabbmkdir datasetmkdir resultsmkdir outputbash docker/run_docker.sh /home/user/project/moabb```Note: It is important to use an absolute path for the root folder to run, but you canmodify the run_docker.sh script to save in another path beyond the root of the project. Bydefault, the script will save the results in the project's root in the folder `results`,the datasets in the folder `dataset` and the output in the folder `output`.### TroubleshootingCurrently pip install moabb fails when pip version &lt; 21, e.g. with 20.0.2 due to an `idna`package conflict. Newer pip versions resolve this conflict automatically. To fix this youcan upgrade your pip version using: `pip install -U pip` before installing `moabb`.## Supported datasetsThe list of supported datasets can be found here :https://neurotechx.github.io/moabb/datasets.htmlDetailed information regarding datasets (electrodes, trials, sessions) are indicated onthe wiki: https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb/wiki/Datasets-Support### Submit a new datasetyou can submit a new dataset by mentioning it to this[issue](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb/issues/1). The datasets currently on our radarcan be seen [here](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb/wiki/Datasets-Support).## Who are we?The founders of the Mother of all BCI Benchmarks are [Alexander Barachant][link_alex_b]and [Vinay Jayaram][link_vinay].

In addition, we offer statistical and visualization utilities to simplify the workflow.### DatasetsA dataset handles and abstracts low-level access to the data. The dataset will read datastored locally, in the format in which they have been downloaded, and will convert theminto a MNE raw object. There are options to pool all the different recording sessions persubject or to evaluate them separately.### ParadigmA paradigm defines how the raw data will be converted to trials ready to be processed by adecoding algorithm. This is a function of the paradigm used, i.e. in motor imagery one canhave two-class, multi-class, or continuous paradigms; similarly, different preprocessingis necessary for ERP vs ERD paradigms.### EvaluationsAn evaluation defines how we go from trials per subject and session to a generalizationstatistic (AUC score, f-score, accuracy, etc) -- it can be either within-recording-sessionaccuracy, across-session within-subject accuracy, across-subject accuracy, or othertransfer learning settings.### PipelinesPipeline defines all steps required by an algorithm to obtain predictions. Pipelines aretypically a chain of sklearn compatible transformers and end with a sklearn compatibleestimator. See[Pipelines](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html)for more info.### Statistics and visualizationOnce an evaluation has been run, the raw results are returned as a DataFrame. This can befurther processed via the following commands to generate some basic visualization andstatistical comparisons:```from moabb.analysis import analyzeresults = evaluation.process(pipeline_dict)analyze(results)```## Citing MOABB and related publicationsTo cite MOABB, you could use the following paper:&gt; Vinay Jayaram and Alexandre Barachant.&gt; [&quot;MOABB: trustworthy algorithm benchmarking for BCIs.&quot;](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/aadea0/meta)&gt; Journal of neural engineering 15.6 (2018): 066011.&gt; [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-2552/aadea0)If you publish a paper using MOABB, please contact us on [gitter][link_gitter] or open anissue, and we will add your paper to the[dedicated wiki page](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb/wiki/MOABB-bibliography).## Thank YouThank you so much (Danke schön!
