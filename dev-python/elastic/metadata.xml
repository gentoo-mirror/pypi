It is a third version of the in-house code I havewritten over few years and is implemented as a extension to the[ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) system. The code was a basis forsome of my publications and was described briefly in these papers. Thecode was available to anyone, presented at the [Workshop on ab initioCalculations in Geosciences](http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/workshop/work2008/)and used by some of my co-workers. This code is a re-implementation ofelastic as a module for the ASE.The on-line documentation is placed on[ReadTheDocs](http://elastic.rtfd.org/) or [Elasticwebsite](http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/elastic/). You can obtain the[documentation as a PDFfile](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/elastic/stable/elastic.pdf) aswell.The docs are also published at: [Elastic overIPFS](https://ipfs.io/ipns/QmSHUr59SLvWEZq7URTDGgouVaq7vFJYG7HqtBgL4s6M2u/)The stable site hash is:/ipns/QmSHUr59SLvWEZq7URTDGgouVaq7vFJYG7HqtBgL4s6M2u/Installation------------The installation is simple if you are using conda package menager:    conda install -c conda-forge elasticIf you need a more elaborate [installationinstruction](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jochym/qe-doc/blob/master/Installation.ipynb)for computing environment to work with ASE - I have written just such adocument. It is a first in the series of tutorials of this subject andyou can find it under nbviewer link above.The project is open and I welcome patches, ideas and other feedback.Acknowledgments---------------In the past the project was partially supported by:-   Department of Computational Material Science, Institute of Nuclear    Physics, PAN, Poland-   Department of Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Canada</longdescription>
