	<longdescription># ControlPyWebA project to facilitate easy read/write to the ControlByWeb line of Automation/SCADA IO products. ## DescriptionXytronic Research makes a handy line of remote IO products useful for home and industrial automation. Interacting with these modules generally requires the use of a url library such as requests, and then requires dissecting the response to be dissectedand processed. While not terribly difficult to do, it is repetitive. This module seeks to abstract out some of that effort in a thought out and tested way. ## Installationpip install controlpyweb## UsageThe basis of functionality is the WebIOModule class. It both acts as a container for individualIO and handles interaction with the hardware. ~~~~from controlpyweb.webio_module import WebIOModulefrom controlpyweb.single_io import DiscreteIn, DiscreteOut, AnalogIn, AnalogOutclass X404DigitalIn(WebIOModule):   # Name the class whatever you like    StartButton = DiscreteIn(&quot;Start Button&quot;, &quot;startButton&quot;)    StopButton = DiscreteIn(&quot;Stop Button&quot;, &quot;stopButton&quot;)    DoorClosed = DiscreteIn(&quot;Door Closed&quot;, &quot;doorClosed&quot;)class X410DigitalOut(WebIOModule):    StartLamp = DiscreteOut(&quot;Start Lapm&quot;, &quot;redLamp&quot;)    MaintLight = DiscreteOut(&quot;Maintenance Lamp&quot;, &quot;lamp1&quot;)digital_in = X404DigitalIn(&quot;192.168.1.1&quot;)relay_out = X410DigitalOut(&quot;192.168.1.2&quot;)digital_in.update_from_module()relay_out.StartLamp = digital_in.StartButtonrelay_out.MaintLight = not digital_in.DoorClosedrelay_out.send_changes_to_module()~~~~##### Immediate reads/writes are supported~~~~relay_out.StartLamp.write_immediate(True)  is_started = digital_in.read_immediate()~~~~(However, immediate reads/writes are costly from a resource perspective and should be avoided.)##### Overrides are common for typical operations~~~~if discrete_in.StartButton and discrete_in.DoorClosed:    discrete_out.StartMachine = True~~~~</longdescription>
