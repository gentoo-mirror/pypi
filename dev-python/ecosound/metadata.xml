It includes modules for manual annotationprocessing and visualization, automatic detection, signal classification, and localization. It heavily relies on libraries such as xarray,pandas, numpy and scikit-learn. Under the hood it also uses dask which supports the processing of large data sets that donâ€™t fit into memory,and makes processing scalable through distributed computing (on either local clusters or on the cloud). Outputs from ecosound are compatible with popular bioacoustics software such as `Raven &lt;https://ravensoundsoftware.com/&gt;`_ and `PAMlab &lt;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52aa2773e4b0f29916f46675/t/5be5b07088251b9f59268184/1541779574284/PAMlab+Brochure.pdf&gt;`_.Status------Ecosound is very much a work in progress and is still under heavy development.
