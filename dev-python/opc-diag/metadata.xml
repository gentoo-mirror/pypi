	<longdescription>*opc-diag* is a command-line application for exploring Microsoft Word, Excel,and PowerPoint files from Office 2007 and later. Also known as *Office OpenXML*, the structure of these files adheres to the Open Packaging Convention(OPC), specified by ISO/IEC 29500.*opc-diag* provides the ``opc`` command, which allows OPC files to be browsed,diff-ed, extracted, repackaged, and parts from one to be substituted intoanother.Its primary use is by developers of software that generates and/ormanipulates Microsoft Office documents.A typical use would be diff-ing a Word file from before and after an operation,say inserting a paragraph, to identify the specific changes Word made to theXML. This is handy when one is developing software to do the same withoutWord's help::   $ opc diff before.docx after.docxAnother main use is to diagnose an issue causing an Office document to not loadcleanly, typically because the software that generated it has a bug. Theseproblems can be tedious and often difficult to diagnose without tools like*opc-diag*, and were the primary motivation for developing it.More information is available in the `opc-diag documentation`_... _`opc-diag documentation`:   https://opc-diag.readthedocs.org/en/latest/History=======1.0.0 (2014-01-14)------------------* Add pretty-printing of extracted XML on extract command0.9.8 (2013-12-13)------------------* hotfix -- fix UnicodeEncodeError on output containing non-ASCII chars0.9.7 (2013-09-23)------------------* Initial release -- supporting browse, diff, diff-item, extract, repackage,  and substitute subcommands.</longdescription>
