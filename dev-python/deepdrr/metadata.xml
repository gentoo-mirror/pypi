Install CUDA. Version 11 is recommended, but DeepDRR has been used with 8.02. Make sure your C compiler is on the path. DeepDRR has been used with `gcc 9.3.0`3. We recommend installing pycuda separately, as it may need to be built. If you are using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), run```bashconda install -c conda-forge pycuda```to install it in your environment.4. You may also wish to [install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) separately, depending on your setup.5. Install from `PyPI````bashpip install deepdrr```### DevelopmentInstalling from the `dev` branch is risky, as it is unstable. However, this installation method can be used for the `main` branch as well, perhaps somewhat more reliably.Dependencies:1. CUDA 11.12. AnacondaThe `dev` branch contains the most up-to-date code and can be easily installed using Anaconda. To create an environment with DeepDRR, run```bashgit clone https://github.com/arcadelab/deepdrr.gitcd deepdrrgit checkout devconda env create -f environment.yamlconda activate deepdrr```## DocumentationDocumentation is available at [deepdrr.readthedocs.io](https://deepdrr.readthedocs.io/).To create the autodocs, run```bashsphinx-apidoc -f -o docs/source deepdrr```in the base directory. Then do `cd docs` and `make html` to build the static site locally.## UsageThe following minimal example loads a CT volume from a NifTi `.nii.gz` file and simulates an X-ray projection:```pythonfrom deepdrr import geo, Volume, MobileCArmfrom deepdrr.projector import Projector # separate import for CUDA initcarm = MobileCArm()ct = Volume.from_nifti('/path/to/ct_image.nii.gz')# Initialize the Projector object (allocates GPU memory)with Projector(ct, carm=carm) as projector:    # Orient and position the patient model in world space.    ct.orient_patient(head_first=True, supine=True)    ct.place_center(carm.isocenter_in_world)        # Move the C-arm to the desired pose.    carm.move_to(alpha=30, beta=10, degrees=True)        # Run projection    image = projector()```The script `example_projector.py` gives an alternative example. Additional tutorials are in progress at [deepdrr.readthedocs.io](https://deepdrr.readthedocs.io). Contributions are welcome.## ContributingContributions for bug fixes, enhancements, and other suggestions are welcome.

The pipeline is illustrated below.![DeepDRR Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcadelab/deepdrr/master/images/deepdrr_workflow.png)Further details can be found in our MICCAI 2018 paper &quot;DeepDRR: A Catalyst for Machine Learning in Fluoroscopy-guided Procedures&quot; and the subsequent Invited Journal Article in the IJCARS Special Issue of MICCAI &quot;Enabling Machine Learning in X-ray-based Procedures via Realistic Simulation of Image Formation&quot;. The conference preprint can be accessed on arXiv here: &lt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08606&gt;.### Representative ResultsThe figure below shows representative radiographs generated using DeepDRR from CT data downloaded from the NIH Cancer Imaging Archive. Please find qualitative results in the **Applications** section.![Representative DeepDRRs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcadelab/deepdrr/master/images/examples.PNG)### Applications - Pelvis Landmark DetectionWe have applied DeepDRR to anatomical landmark detection in pelvic X-ray: &quot;X-ray-transform Invariant Anatomical Landmark Detection for Pelvic Trauma Surgery&quot;, also early-accepted at MICCAI'18: &lt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08608&gt; and now with quantitative evaluation in the IJCARS Special Issue on MICCAI'18: &lt;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11548-019-01975-5&gt;. The ConvNet for prediction was trained on DeepDRRs of 18 CT scans of the NIH Cancer Imaging Archive and then applied to ex vivo data acquired with a Siemens Cios Fusion C-arm machine equipped with a flat panel detector (Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany). Some representative results on the ex vivo data are shown below.![Prediction Performance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcadelab/deepdrr/master/images/landmark_performance_real_data.PNG)### Applications - Metal Tool InsertionDeepDRR has also been applied to simulate X-rays of the femur during insertion of dexterous manipulaters in orthopedic surgery: &quot;Localizing dexterous surgical tools in X-ray for image-based navigation&quot;, which has been accepted at IPCAI'19: &lt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06672&gt;. Simulated images are used to train a concurrent segmentation and localization network for tool detection. We found consistent performance on both synthetic and real X-rays of ex vivo specimens. The tool model, simulation image and detection results are shown below.This capability has not been tested in version 1.0. For tool insertion, we recommend working with [Version 0.1](https://github.com/arcadelab/deepdrr/releases/tag/0.1) for the time being.![Robot Insertion and Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcadelab/deepdrr/master/images/tool_insertion.png)### Potential Challenges - General1. Our material decomposition V-net was trained on NIH Cancer Imagign Archive data. In case it does not generalize perfectly to other acquisitions, the use of intensity thresholds (as is done in conventional Monte Carlo) is still supported. In this case, however, thresholds will likely need to be selected on a per-dataset, or worse, on a per-region basis since bone density can vary considerably.2. Scatter estimation is currently limited to Rayleigh scatter and we are working on improving this. Scatter estimation was trained on images with 1240x960 pixels with 0.301 mm. The scatter signal is a composite of Rayleigh, Compton, and multi-path scattering. While all scatter sources produce low frequency signals, Compton and multi-path are more blurred compared to Rayleigh, suggesting that simple scatter reduction techniques may do an acceptable job. In most clinical products, scatter reduction is applied as pre-processing before the image is displayed and accessible. Consequently, the current shortcoming of not providing _full scatter estimation_ is likely not critical for many applications, in fact, scatter can even be turned off completely. We would like to refer to the **Applications** section above for some preliminary evidence supporting this reasoning.3. Due to the nature of volumetric image processing, DeepDRR consumes a lot of GPU memory. We have successfully tested on 12 GB of GPU memory but cannot tell about 8 GB at the moment. The bottleneck is volumetric segmentation, which can be turned off and replaced by thresholds (see 1.).4. We currently provide the X-ray source sprectra from MC-GPU that are fairly standard. Additional spectra can be implemented in spectrum_generator.py.5. The current detector reading is _the average energy deposited by a single photon in a pixel_. If you are interested in modeling photon counting or energy resolving detectors, then you may want to take a look at `mass_attenuation(_gpu).py` to implement your detector.6. Currently we do not support import of full projection matrices. But you will need to define K, R, and T seperately or use camera.py to define projection geometry online.7. It is important to check proper import of CT volumes. We have tried to account for many variations (HU scale offsets, slice order, origin, file extensions) but one can never be sure enough, so please double check for your files.### Potential Challenges - Tool Modeling1. Currently, the tool/implant model must be represented as a binary 3D volume, rather than a CAD surface model. However, this 3D volume can be of different resolution than the CT volume; particularly, it can be much higher to preserve fine structures of the tool/implant.2. The density of the tool needs to be provided via hard coding in the file 'load_dicom_tool.py' (line 127). The pose of the tool/implant with respect to the CT volume requires manual setup. We provide one example origin setting at line 23-24.3. The tool/implant will supersede the anatomy defined by the CT volume intensities. To this end, we sample the CT materials and densities at the location of the tool in the tool volume, and subtract them from the anatomy forward projections in detector domain (to enable different resolutions of CT and tool volume). Further information can be found in the IJCARS article.### Using DeepDRR Simultaneously with PyTorchSome issues may arise when using DeepDRR at the same time as PyTorch due to conflicts between pycuda's CUDA initialization and PyTorch CUDA initialization. The best workaround we know of is to first initialize the PyCUDA context (by importing `deepdrr.projector`) and then run your model on a dummy batch before creating a `Projector` object. For mysterious reasons (likely involving overlapping GPU resources and the retrograde of Mercury), this seems to work.```Pythonimport torchfrom torch import nnfrom torchvision import modelsimport deepdrrfrom deepdrr.projector import Projector # initializes PyCUDA# Before creating a Projector, run backprop to initialize PyTorchcriterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()model = models.resnet50() # Your model heremodel.cuda()optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)optimizer.zero_grad()x = torch.ones((32, 3, 224, 224), dtype=torch.float32).cuda() # Your image sizey = torch.ones(32, dtype=torch.int64).cuda()y_pred = model(x)loss = criterion(y_pred, y)loss.backward()optimizer.step()log.info(f&quot;Ran dummy batch to initialize torch.&quot;)volume = ...carm = ...with Projector(volume, carm=carm):  image = projector()  image = image.unsqueeze(0) # add batch dim  y_pred = model(image)  ...```## ReferenceWe hope this proves useful for medical imaging research.
