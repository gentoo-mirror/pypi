You will need to get your secret API key from the dashboard to be able to use the SDK. Once you have your API key, all you need to do is initialize a `Fintoc` object with it and you're ready to start enjoying Fintoc!```pythonfrom fintoc import Fintocfintoc_client = Fintoc(&quot;your_api_key&quot;)```Now you can start using the SDK!### ManagersTo make the usage of the SDK feel natural, resources are managed by **managers** (_wow_). These **managers** correspond to objects with some methods that allow you to get the resources that you want. Each manager is _attached_ to another resource, following the API structure. For example, the `Fintoc` object has `links` and `webhook_endpoints` managers, while `Link` objects have an `accounts` manager (we will see more examples soon). Notice that **not every manager has all of the methods**, as they correspond to the API capabilities. The methods of the managers are the following (we will use the `webhook_endpoints` manager as an example):#### `all`You can use the `all` method of the managers as follows:```pythonwebhook_endpoints = fintoc_client.webhook_endpoints.all()```The `all` method of the managers returns **a generator** with all the instances of the resource. This method can also receive `kwargs`! The arguments that can be passed are the arguments that the API receives for that specific resource! For example, the `Movement` resource can be filtered using `since` and `until`, so if you wanted to get a range of `movements` from an `account`, all you need to do is to pass the parameters to the method!```pythonmovements = account.movements.all(since=&quot;2019-07-24&quot;, until=&quot;2021-05-12&quot;)```You can also pass the `lazy=False` parameter to the method to force the SDK to return a list of all the instances of the resource instead of the generator. **Beware**: this could take **very long**, depending on the amount of instances that exist of said resource:```pythonwebhook_endpoints = fintoc_client.webhook_endpoints.all(lazy=False)isinstance(webhook_endpoints, list)  # True```#### `get`You can use the `get` method of the managers as follows:```pythonwebhook_endpoint = fintoc_client.webhook_endpoints.get(&quot;we_8anqVLlBC8ROodem&quot;)```The `get` method of the managers returns an existing instance of the resource using its identifier to find it.#### `create`You can use the `create` method of the managers as follows:```pythonwebhook_endpoint = fintoc_client.webhook_endpoints.create(    url=&quot;https://webhook.site/58gfb429-c33c-20c7-584b-d5ew3y3202a0&quot;,    enabled_events=[&quot;link.credentials_changed&quot;],    description=&quot;Fantasting webhook endpoint&quot;,)```The `create` method of the managers creates and returns a new instance of the resource. The attributes of the created object are passed as `kwargs`, and correspond to the parameters specified by the API documentation for the creation of said resource.#### `update`You can use the `update` method of the managers as follows:```pythonwebhook_endpoint = fintoc_client.webhook_endpoints.update(    &quot;we_8anqVLlBC8ROodem&quot;,    enabled_events=[&quot;account.refresh_intent.succeeded&quot;],    disabled=True,)```The `update` method of the managers updates and returns an existing instance of the resource using its identifier to find it. The first parameter of the method corresponds to the identifier being used to find the existing instance of the resource. The attributes to be modified are passed as `kwargs`, and correspond to the parameters specified by the API documentation for the update action of said resource.Notice that using the manager to update an instance of a resource is equivalent (in terms of outcome) to calling the `update` directly on the object itself:```python# Using the managerwebhook_endpoint = fintoc_client.webhook_endpoints.update(    &quot;we_8anqVLlBC8ROodem&quot;,    enabled_events=[&quot;account.refresh_intent.succeeded&quot;],    disabled=True,)# Using the objectwebhook_endpoint = fintoc_client.webhook_endpoints.get(&quot;we_8anqVLlBC8ROodem&quot;)webhook_endpoint.update(    enabled_events=[&quot;account.refresh_intent.succeeded&quot;],    disabled=True,)```When using the SDK, you will probably almost always want to use the object directly to update, just because it is way less verbose if you already have the object itself. Also, using the `update` method from the manager first needs to `get` the resource and then updates it, so it translates to 2 API calls. If you already have the object to update, using the `update` method directly from the object just updates it, so it translates to just 1 API call.#### `delete`You can use the `delete` method of the managers as follows:```pythondeleted_identifier = fintoc_client.webhook_endpoints.delete(&quot;we_8anqVLlBC8ROodem&quot;)```The `delete` method of the managers deletes an existing instance of the resource using its identifier to find it and returns the identifier.Notice that using the manager to delete an instance of a resource is equivalent (in terms of outcome) to calling the `delete` directly on the object itself:```python# Using the managerdeleted_identifier = fintoc_client.webhook_endpoints.delete(&quot;we_8anqVLlBC8ROodem&quot;)# Using the objectwebhook_endpoint = fintoc_client.webhook_endpoints.get(&quot;we_8anqVLlBC8ROodem&quot;)deleted_identifier = webhook_endpoint.delete()```When using the SDK, you will probably almost always want to use the object directly to delete, just because it is way less verbose if you already have the object itself. Also, using the `delete` method from the manager first needs to `get` the resource and then deletes it, so it translates to 2 API calls. If you already have the object to delete, using the `delete` method directly from the object just deletes it, so it translates to just 1 API call.### The shape of the SDKFor complete information about the API, head to [the docs](https://fintoc.com/docs). You will notice that the shape of the SDK is very similar to the shape of the API. Let's start with the `Fintoc` object.#### The `Fintoc` objectTo create a `Fintoc` object, instantiate it using your secret API key:```pythonfrom fintoc import Fintocfintoc_client = Fintoc(&quot;your_api_key&quot;)```This gives us access to a bunch of operations already. The object created using this _snippet_ contains three [managers](#managers): `links`, `payment_intents` and `webhook_endpoints`.#### The `webhook_endpoints` managerAvailable methods: `all`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`.From the Fintoc client, you can manage your webhook endpoints swiftly! Start by creating a new Webhook Endpoint!```pythonwebhook_endpoint = fintoc_client.webhook_endpoints.create(    url=&quot;https://webhook.site/58gfb429-c33c-20c7-584b-d5ew3y3202a0&quot;,    enabled_events=[&quot;account.refresh_intent.succeeded&quot;],    disabled=True,)print(webhook_endpoint.id)  # we_8anqVLlBC8ROodem```You can update this webhook endpoint any time you want! Just run the following command:```pythonwebhook_endpoint = fintoc_client.webhook_endpoints.update(    &quot;we_8anqVLlBC8ROodem&quot;,    enabled_events=[&quot;link.credentials_changed&quot;],    description=&quot;Fantasting webhook endpoint&quot;,)print(webhook_endpoint.status)  # disabled```Maybe you no longer want this webhook endpoint. Let's delete it!```pythonfintoc_client.webhook_endpoints.delete(&quot;we_8anqVLlBC8ROodem&quot;)```Now, let's list every webhook endpoint we have:```pythonfor webhook_endpoint in fintoc_client.webhook_endpoints.all():    print(webhook_endpoint.id)```If you see a webhook endpoint you want to use, just use the `get` method!```pythonwebhook_endpoint = fintoc_client.webhook_endpoints.get(&quot;we_8anqVLlBC8ROodem&quot;)print(webhook_endpoint.id)  # we_8anqVLlBC8ROodem```#### The `payment_intents` managerAvailable methods: `all`, `get`, `create`.Payment intents allow you to start a payment using Fintoc! Start by creating a new payment intent:```pythonpayment_intent = fintoc_client.payment_intents.create(    currency=&quot;CLP&quot;,    amount=5990,    recipient_account={        &quot;holder_id&quot;: &quot;111111111&quot;,        &quot;number&quot;: &quot;123123123&quot;,        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;checking_account&quot;,        &quot;institution_id&quot;: &quot;cl_banco_de_chile&quot;,    })print(payment_intent.id)            # pi_BO381oEATXonG6bjprint(payment_intent.widget_token)  # pi_BO381oEATXonG6bj_sec_a4xK32BanKWYn```Notice that the success of this payment intent will be notified through a Webhook. Now, let's list every payment intent we have:```pythonfor payment_intent in fintoc_client.payment_intents.all():    print(payment_intent.id)```If you see a payment intent you want to use, just use the `get` method!```pythonpayment_intent = fintoc_client.payment_intents.get(&quot;pi_BO381oEATXonG6bj&quot;)print(payment_intent.id)      # pi_BO381oEATXonG6bjprint(payment_intent.status)  # succeeded```#### The `links` managerAvailable methods: `all`, `get`, `update`, `delete`.Links are probably the most importat resource. Let's list them!```pythonprint(len(fintoc_client.links.all(lazy=False)))  # 3for link in fintoc_client.links.all():    print(link.id)```Links are a bit different than the rest of the resources, because their identifier is not really their `id`, but their `link_token`. This means that, in order to `get`, `update` or `delete` a link, you need to pass the `link_token`!```pythonlink = fintoc_client.links.get(&quot;link_Y75EXAKiIVj7w489_token_NCqjwRVoTX3cmnx8pnbpqd11&quot;)```Notice that the Link objects generated from the `all` method will won't be able to execute `update` or `delete` operations, while any Link object generated from `get` or `update` will have permission to `update` or `delete` (given that the link token is necessary to `get` or `update` in the first place).The Link resource has a lot of **managers**!```pythoninvoices = link.invoices.all()  # Invoicestax_returns = link.tax_returns.all()  # Tax Returnssubscriptions = link.subscriptions.all()  # Subscriptionsrefresh_intents = link.refresh_intents.all()  # Refresh Intentsaccounts = link.accounts.all()  # Accounts```#### The `invoices` managerAvailable methods: `all`.Once you have a Link, you can use the `invoices` manager to get all the invoices associated to a link!```pythonfor invoice in link.invoices.all():    print(invoice.id)```#### The `tax_returns` managerAvailable methods: `all`, `get`.Once you have a Link, you can use the `tax_returns` manager to get all the tax returns associated to a link!```pythonfor tax_return in link.tax_returns.all():    print(tax_return.id)```#### The `refresh_intents` managerAvailable methods: `all`, `get`, `create`.Refresh intents allow you to control how an account gets refreshed on Fintoc! Once you have a Link, you can use the `refresh_intents` manager to create a new refresh intent:```pythonrefresh_intent = link.refresh_intents.create()print(refresh_intent.id)  # ri_5A94DVCJ7xNM3MEo```Notice that the success of this refresh intent will be notified through a Webhook. Now, let's list every refresh intent we have:```pythonfor refresh_intent in link.refresh_intents.all():    print(refresh_intent.id)```If you see a refresh intent you want to use, just use the `get` method!```pythonrefresh_intent = link.refresh_intents.get(&quot;ri_5A94DVCJ7xNM3MEo&quot;)print(refresh_intent.id)      # ri_5A94DVCJ7xNM3MEoprint(refresh_intent.status)  # succeeded```#### The `accounts` managerAvailable methods: `all`, `get`.Once you have a Link, you can use the `accounts` manager to get all the accounts associated to a link!```pythonfor account in link.accounts.all():    print(account.id)```Notice that accounts also have a `movements` manager, to get all of the movements of an account:```pythonaccount = link.accounts.all(lazy=False)[0]movements = account.movements.all(lazy=False)```#### The `movements` managerAvailable methods: `all`, `get`.Once you have an Account, you can use the `movements` manager to get all the movements associated to that account!```pythonfor movement in account.movements.all():    print(movement.id)```#### The `subscription_intents` managerAvailable methods: `all`, `get`, `create`Subscription intents allow you to start a subscription using Fintoc!:```pythonsubscription_intent = fintoc_client.subscription_intents.create()print(subscription_intent.id)            # si_BO381oEATXonG6bjprint(subscription_intent.widget_token)  # si_BO381oEATXonG6bj_sec_a4xK32BanKWYn```#### The `subscriptions` managerAvailable methods: `all`, `get`You can check the status of the created subscription with the `subscriptions` manager```pythonsubscription = fintoc_client.subscriptions.get('&lt;subscription_id&gt;')print(subscription.status)```#### The `charges` managerAvailable methods: `all`, `get`, `create`Once you have active subscriptions, you can use the `charges` manager to create charges to thosse subscriptions```pythoncharge = fintoc_client.charges.create(    currency='CLP',    amount=1250,    subscription_id='&lt;subscription_id&gt;',)```### SerializationAny resource of the SDK can be serialized! To get the serialized resource, just call the `serialize` method!```pythonaccount = link.accounts.all(lazy=False)[0]serialization = account.serialize()```The serialization corresponds to a dictionary with only simple types, that can be JSON-serialized.## AcknowledgementsThe first version of this SDK was originally designed and handcrafted by [**@nebil**](https://github.com/nebil),[ad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_honorem) [piscolem](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/piscola).He built it with the help of Gianni Roberto‚Äôs [Picchi 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqjUlmkYr2g).</longdescription>
