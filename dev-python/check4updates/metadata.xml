To minimise runtime, *check4updates* only checks online if certain conditions are met, such as sufficient time since the last check. This ensures that incorporating *check4updates* into your Python package will have a negligible (&lt;0.01sec) effect on the time it takes users to import something from your package (which is when `__init__.py` is called) and no impact on any of the functions within your package.When *check4updates* does check online, it searches PyPI for the most recent release (based on version number) and compares that value with the version installed on the userâ€™s system. If certain conditions are met, the user is then prompted to install the updated version which must be done by the user in a separate command so as not to interrupt the currently executing script. Users can choose to upgrade now, skip this version, be reminded later, or never be asked again and *check4updates* will remember this choice and act accordingly.## DocumentationDetailed documentation and examples are available at [readthedocs](https://check4updates.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).## Design principles- periodically check for updates without user action and without slowing down the parent script- only prompt the user when necessary- give the user the option to update now, be reminded later, skip this version, or never be asked again- handle all errors silently to prevent the parent script from being impacted## UsageTo use *check4updates*, place the following lines in your package's `__init__.py` file:```pythonfrom check4updates import check_and_promptcheck_and_prompt(&quot;your_package&quot;)```It is as simple as that and *check4updates* will do the rest!## ContactIf you find any errors, have any suggestions, or would like to request that something be added, please email [alpha.reliability@gmail.com](mailto:alpha.reliability@gmail.com).If you would like to receive an email notification when a new release of *check4updates* is uploaded to PyPI, [NewReleases.io](https://newreleases.io/) provides this service for free.</longdescription>
