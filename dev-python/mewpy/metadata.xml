	<longdescription>MEWpy======MEWpy is an integrated Metabolic Engineering Workbench for strain design optimization. It offers methods to explore different classes of constraint-based models (CBM) for:- Simulation: allows to simulate of steady-state metabolic models, considering different formulations (e.g., GECKO, ETFL) and kinetic models;- Optimization: performs Evolutionary Computation based strain design optimization by knocking out (KO) or over/under expressing (OU) reactions, genes, or enzymes.- Omics data integration (eFlux, GIMME, iMAT);- Regulatory networks integration (rFBA, srFBA)MEWPy currently supports REFRAMED and COBRApy simulation environments.
