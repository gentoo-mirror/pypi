It can also be easilyextended to support other kinds of data sources.Cedar Backup is focused around weekly backups to a single CD or DVD disc,with the expectation that the disc will be changed or overwritten at thebeginning of each week.  If your hardware is new enough, Cedar Backup canwrite multisession discs, allowing you to add incremental data to a disc ona daily basis.  Alternately, Cedar Backup can write your backups to the AmazonS3 cloud rather than relying on physical media.  See the [Cedar Backup v3 Software Manual](https://cedar-backup3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual/index.html) for details.Besides offering command-line utilities to manage the backup process, CedarBackup provides a well-organized library of backup-related functionality.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://cedar-backup3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/autoapi/index.html).There are many different backup software systems in the open source world.Cedar Backup aims to fill a niche: it aims to be a good fit for people who needto back up a limited amount of important data on a regular basis. Cedar Backupisnâ€™t for you if you want to back up your huge MP3 collection every night, orif you want to back up a few hundred machines.  However, if you administer asmall set of machines and you want to run daily incremental backups for thingslike system configuration, current email, small web sites, source coderepositories, or small databases, then Cedar Backup is probably worth yourtime.</longdescription>
