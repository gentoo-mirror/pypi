Our focus is on providing essential utilities that make it easy to incorporate artificial intelligence into your codebase without unnecessary complexities.## Features- **Function-like API**: With GPT-Fn, you can utilize AI capabilities in your code just like any other function. No need to learn complex AI frameworks or APIs; simply call our functions and harness the power of AI effortlessly.- **AI Integration**: GPT-Fn seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art AI models, allowing you to perform tasks such as natural language processing, image recognition, sentiment analysis, and much more.- **Flexible Configuration**: We provide a range of configurable options to fine-tune the behavior of AI functions according to your specific requirements. Customize the models, parameters, and output formats to suit your application's needs.- **Well Tested**: GPT-Fn comes with a comprehensive suite of test cases, ensuring the reliability and stability of the library. We strive to provide a robust solution that you can trust in your production environments.- **Open-Source**: GPT-Fn is an open-source project, enabling collaboration and contribution from the developer community. Feel free to explore the source code, suggest improvements, and contribute to making GPT-Fn even more powerful.## InstallationYou can install GPT-Fn using pip, the Python package manager:```bashpip install gpt-fn```## Getting StartedTo start using GPT-Fn in your project, import the library and call the desired function:```pythonfrom gpt_fn.completion import chat_completiongenerated_text = chat_completion(    [        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;You are a helpful assistant.&quot;},        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello, who are you?&quot;},    ],)print(generated_text)```In the example above, we use the `chat_completion` function to generate response by AI. `chat_completion` also raises error on incomplete responses. The implementation of `chat_completion` makes the most common use case easy. You can explore other available functions in the GPT-Fn documentation/[tests](src/gpt_fn/tests/) for a wide range of AI tasks.## ContributingWe welcome contributions from the developer community to help improve GPT-Fn.
