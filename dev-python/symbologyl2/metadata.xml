Given how [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) operates, it's necessary to duplicatemetadata between `[tool.poetry]` and `[project]`. Make sure that all of the following get set:```pyproject.toml[tool.poetry]version = &quot;x.y.z&quot;[project]version = &quot;x.y.z&quot;``````Cargo.toml[package]version = &quot;x.y.z&quot;```</longdescription>
