Most  of the time, you will not get in contact with raw XML or character data, even  when implementing a new protocol.* Secure by default: TLS is required by default, as well as certificate  validation. Certificate or public key pinning can be used, if needed.* Support for `RFC 6121 (Instant Messaging and Presence)  &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6121&gt;`_ roster and presence management, along  with `XEP-0045 (Multi-User Chats)  &lt;https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html&gt;`_ for your human-to-human needs.* Support for `XEP-0060 (Publish-Subscribe)  &lt;https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html&gt;`_ and `XEP-0050 (Ad-Hoc Commands)  &lt;https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0050.html&gt;`_ for your machine-to-machine  needs.* Several other XEPs, such as `XEP-0115  &lt;https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0115.html&gt;`_ (including native support for  the reading and writing the `capsdb &lt;https://github.com/xnyhps/capsdb&gt;`_) and  `XEP-0131 &lt;https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0131.html&gt;`_.* APIs suitable for both one-shot scripts and long-running multi-account  clients.* Well-tested and modular codebase: aioxmpp is developed in test-driven  style and in addition to that, many modules are automatedly tested against  `Prosody &lt;https://prosody.im/&gt;`_ and `ejabberd &lt;https://www.ejabberd.im/&gt;`_,  two popular XMPP servers.There is more and there’s yet more to come!
