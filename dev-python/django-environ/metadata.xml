	<longdescription>==============django-environ==============``django-environ`` is the Python package that allows you to use`Twelve-factor methodology &lt;https://www.12factor.net/&gt;`_ to configure yourDjango application with environment variables... -teaser-end-For that, it gives you an easy way to configure Django application usingenvironment variables obtained from an environment file and provided by the OS:.. -code-begin-.. code-block:: python   import environ   import os   env = environ.Env(       # set casting, default value       DEBUG=(bool, False)   )   # Set the project base directory   BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))   # Take environment variables from .env file   environ.Env.read_env(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '.env'))   # False if not in os.environ because of casting above   DEBUG = env('DEBUG')   # Raises Django's ImproperlyConfigured   # exception if SECRET_KEY not in os.environ   SECRET_KEY = env('SECRET_KEY')   # Parse database connection url strings   # like psql://user:pass@127.0.0.1:8458/db   DATABASES = {       # read os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] and raises       # ImproperlyConfigured exception if not found       #       # The db() method is an alias for db_url().       'default': env.db(),       # read os.environ['SQLITE_URL']       'extra': env.db_url(           'SQLITE_URL',           default='sqlite:////tmp/my-tmp-sqlite.db'       )   }   CACHES = {       # Read os.environ['CACHE_URL'] and raises       # ImproperlyConfigured exception if not found.       #       # The cache() method is an alias for cache_url().       'default': env.cache(),       # read os.environ['REDIS_URL']       'redis': env.cache_url('REDIS_URL')   }.. -overview-The idea of this package is to unify a lot of packages that make the same stuff:Take a string from ``os.environ``, parse and cast it to some of useful pythontyped variables. To do that and to use the `12factor &lt;https://www.12factor.net/&gt;`_approach, some connection strings are expressed as url, so this package can parseit and return a ``urllib.parse.ParseResult``. These strings from ``os.environ``are loaded from a ``.env`` file and filled in ``os.environ`` with ``setdefault``method, to avoid to overwrite the real environ.A similar approach is used in `Two Scoops of Django &lt;https://www.feldroy.com/books/two-scoops-of-django-3-x&gt;`_book and explained in `12factor-django &lt;https://wellfire.co/learn/easier-12-factor-django&gt;`_article.Using ``django-environ`` you can stop to make a lot of unversioned``settings_*.py`` to configure your app.See `cookiecutter-django &lt;https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django&gt;`_for a concrete example on using with a django project.**Feature Support**- Fast and easy multi environment for deploy- Fill ``os.environ`` with .env file variables- Variables casting- Url variables exploded to django specific package settings- Optional support for Docker-style file based config variables (use  ``environ.FileAwareEnv`` instead of ``environ.Env``).. -project-information-Project Information===================``django-environ`` is released under the `MIT / X11 License &lt;https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/&gt;`__,its documentation lives at `Read the Docs &lt;https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_,the code on `GitHub &lt;https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ&gt;`_,and the latest release on `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/django-environ/&gt;`_.It’s rigorously tested on Python 3.5+, and officially supportsDjango 1.11, 2.2, 3., 3.1, 3.2, 4.0 and 4.1.If you'd like to contribute to ``django-environ`` you're most welcome!.. -support-Support=======Should you have any question, any remark, or if you find a bug, or if there issomething you can't do with the ``django-environ``, please`open an issue &lt;https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ&gt;`_.Contributing============If you would like to contribute to ``django-environ``, please take a look at the`current issues &lt;https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ/issues&gt;`_.
