For example, a migration that adds a new field to a model.* ``Safe.after_deploy``  This migration is only safe to run after the code change is deployed.  This is the default that is applied if no ``safe`` property is given.  For example, a migration that removes a field from a model.* ``Safe.always``  This migration is safe to run before *and* after  the code change is deployed.  For example, a migration that changes the ``help_text`` of a field.Nonstrict Mode==============Under normal operation, if there are migrationsthat must run before the deployment that dependon any migration that is marked to run after deployment(or is not marked),the command will raise an error to indicatethat there are protected migrations thatshould have already been run, but have not been,and are blocking migrations that are expected to run.In development, however, it is common that thesewould accumulate between developers,and since it is acceptable for there to be downtimeduring the transitional period in development,it is better to allow the command to continue without raising.To enable nonstrict mode, add the ``SAFEMIGRATE`` setting:.. code-block:: python    SAFEMIGRATE = &quot;nonstrict&quot;In this mode ``safemigrate`` will run all the migrationsthat are not blocked by any unsafe migrations.Any remaining migrations can be run after the factusing the normal ``migrate`` Django command.</longdescription>
