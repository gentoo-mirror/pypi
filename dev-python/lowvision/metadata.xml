	<longdescription># Tools for low-vision coders## Shell ChatA wrapper for your shell that lets you talk to ChatGPT about the recent interactions.1. Wraps bash or another shell you pass in, so that it behaves exactly like what you'd expect.2. Except that when you run the `chat` command, it switches into a separate mode where you're talking to ChatGPT about the past 3k (configurable) characters of interaction.3. You have a back and forth conversation, and all of ChatGPT's responses are read aloud.4. You can `Ctrl-C` to interrupt and go back to the chat prompt.5. You type `exit` to go back to your shell.### InstallationFrom the Python environment _that will be activated when your chosen shell starts_, run```bashpip install lowvision```Then set [your OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)```bashexport OPENAI_API_KEY='whatever'```NOTE: The reason for installing in the Python environment active when your shell starts is because a `chat` command isinstalled by `lowvision` that activates chat mode, and it must be available inside your wrapped shell.if you've installed in a virtualenv instead, you'll need to activate that virtualenv after running the shell wrapper,or `chat` won't properly activate chat mode.### UsageSee the help with ```bashpython -m lowvision.shell -h```Without arguments, it will- launch Bash- with a 3000 character scrollback buffer- use `espeak` for text-to-speech- and `gpt-3.5-turbo` as the ChatGPT modelHere's an example that changes those defaults:```bashpython -m lowvision.shell --shell /bin/sh \                          --scrollback 5000 \                          --tts 'say -v Daniel --rate 220' \                          --model gpt-4                          sh-3.2$ ping -c 3 google.comPING google.com (142.251.163.100): 56 data bytes64 bytes from 142.251.163.100: icmp_seq=0 ttl=106 time=18.316 ms^C--- google.com ping statistics ---1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0.0% packet lossround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 18.316/18.316/18.316/0.000 mssh-3.2$ chat     ?&gt; what happened?The user performed a ping test to google.com by sending 3 packets, and received a reply from one packet. The response shows the IP address of google.com and the round-trip time for the packet. The test was interrupted with ^C after receiving one response.?&gt; exitsh-3.2$```### Installing as the default shellIf you want to use this as your default shell, you could create a script like this (replacing the path to the Pythonenvironment where you installed `lowvision`) and then set your default shell to that script.```bash#!/bin/shexport OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;whatever&quot;/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/mambaforge/base/bin/python3 -m lowvision.shell```Then make it executable, and set it as your default shell with `chsh -s /path/to/your/script.sh`.</longdescription>
