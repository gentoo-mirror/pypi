It aims to provide a simple way for secondary school students  to learn and calculate equations that they often use.***### Functions include:- _A function that calculates power from energy and time_- _A function that calculates energy from power and time_- _A function that calculates time from power and energy_- _A function that uses Pythagorean theorem to calculate the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle_- _A function that uses Pythagorean theorem to calculate a leg of a right-angled triangle_- _A function that calculates the area of a triangle_- _A function that calculates the area of a trapezium_- _A function that calculates the volume of a right rectangle pyramid_- _A function that calculates the area of a circle_- _A function that calculates the circumference of a circle_- _A function that calculates the circumference of a circle using diameter_- _A function that calculates the area of a sector in a circle_- _A function that calculates the volume of a square based pyramid_- _A function that calculates the Lowest Common Multiple from 2 numbers_- _A function that calculates the Lowest Common Multiple from 3 numbers_- _A function that calculates the Lowest Common Multiple from 4 numbers_- _A function that calculates the Lowest Common Multiple from 5 numbers_### To install:    &gt;&gt;&gt; python3 -m pip install school_algorithms### To upgrade to latest version:    &gt;&gt;&gt; python3 -m pip --upgrade school_algorithms### To import:    &gt;&gt;&gt; import school_algorithms## How to use documentation:##### Documentation is in the form of docstrings provided with the code.##### The docstring examples assume that 'school_algorithms' has been imported:    &gt;&gt;&gt; import school_algorithms##### Code snippets are indicated by three greater-than signs:    &gt;&gt;&gt; x = 42    &gt;&gt;&gt; x = x + 1##### Use the built-in ``help`` function to view a function's docstring:    &gt;&gt;&gt; help(school_algorithms.power_calc)[contributors-shield]: https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/Sammygarch/school_algorithms.svg?style=for-the-badge[contributors-url]: https://github.com/Sammygarch/school_algorithms/graphs/contributors[forks-shield]: https://img.shields.io/github/forks/Sammygarch/school_algorithms.svg?style=for-the-badge[forks-url]: https://github.com/Sammygarch/school_algorithms/network/members[stars-shield]: https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Sammygarch/school_algorithms.svg?style=for-the-badge[stars-url]: https://github.com/Sammygarch/school_algorithms/stargazers[issues-shield]: https://img.shields.io/github/issues/Sammygarch/school_algorithms.svg?style=for-the-badge[issues-url]: https://github.com/Sammygarch/school_algorithms/issues[license-shield]: https://img.shields.io/github/license/Sammygarch/school_algorithms.svg?style=for-the-badge[license-url]: https://github.com/Sammygarch/school_algorithms/blob/master/LICENSE.txt</longdescription>
