With this service, 0.1s is the slowest speed ever measured.&lt;/div&gt;---# Playwright-reCAPTCHAA Python library for solving reCAPTCHA v2 and v3 with Playwright.## Solving reCAPTCHA v2reCAPTCHA v2 is solved by using the following methods:- Solving the audio challenge by transcribing the audio using the Google speech recognition API and entering the text as the response.- Solving the image challenge using the CapSolver API for image classification.## Solving reCAPTCHA v3The solving of reCAPTCHA v3 is done by the browser itself, so this library simply waits for the browser to make a POST request to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/reload or https://www.google.com/recaptcha/enterprise/reload and parses the response to get the `g-recaptcha-response` token.---All solvers return the `g-recaptcha-response` token, which is required for form submissions. If you are unsure about the version of reCAPTCHA being used, you can check out [this blog post](https://www.capsolver.com/blog/reCAPTCHA/identify-what-recaptcha-version-is-being-used) for more information.## Installation    pip install playwright-recaptchaThis library requires FFmpeg to be installed on your system in order to convert the audio challenge from reCAPTCHA v2 into text.|   OS    |        Command         || :-----: | :--------------------: || Debian  | apt-get install ffmpeg ||  MacOS  |  brew install ffmpeg   || Windows | winget install ffmpeg  |You can also download the latest static build from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).&gt; **Note**&gt; Make sure to have the ffmpeg and ffprobe binaries in your system's PATH so that the SpeechRecognition library can find them.## reCAPTCHA v2 ExampleFor more reCAPTCHA v2 examples, see the [examples folder](https://github.com/Xewdy444/Playwright-reCAPTCHA/tree/main/examples/recaptchav2).```pythonfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwrightfrom playwright_recaptcha import recaptchav2with sync_playwright() as playwright:    browser = playwright.firefox.launch()    page = browser.new_page()    page.goto(&quot;https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo&quot;)    with recaptchav2.SyncSolver(page) as solver:        token = solver.solve_recaptcha(wait=True)        print(token)```If you would like to solve the image challenge, you can set the `CAPSOLVER_API_KEY` environment variable to your CapSolver API key. You can also pass the API key as an argument to `recaptchav2.SyncSolver()` with `capsolver_api_key=&quot;your_api_key&quot;`. Then, set `image_challenge=True` in `solver.solve_recaptcha()`.```pythonwith recaptchav2.SyncSolver(page, capsolver_api_key=&quot;your_api_key&quot;) as solver:    token = solver.solve_recaptcha(wait=True, image_challenge=True)    print(token)```## reCAPTCHA v3 ExampleFor more reCAPTCHA v3 examples, see the [examples folder](https://github.com/Xewdy444/Playwright-reCAPTCHA/tree/main/examples/recaptchav3).```pythonfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwrightfrom playwright_recaptcha import recaptchav3with sync_playwright() as playwright:    browser = playwright.firefox.launch()    page = browser.new_page()    with recaptchav3.SyncSolver(page) as solver:        page.goto(&quot;https://antcpt.com/score_detector/&quot;)        token = solver.solve_recaptcha()        print(token)```It is best to initialize the solver before navigating to the page with the reCAPTCHA v3 challenge. This is because the solver adds a listener for the POST request to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/reload or https://www.google.com/recaptcha/enterprise/reload and if the request is made before the listener is added, the `g-recaptcha-response` token will not be captured.## DisclaimerThis library is intended for use in automated testing and development environments only and should not be used for any illegal or malicious purposes.
