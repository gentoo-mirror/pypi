	<longdescription># PyazoPyazo is a self-hosted screenshot and image upload utility. It allows you to take a screenshot of a part of your screen and automatically upload it to your own server. You can also directly upload an image from your computer.It is comprised of a cross-platform client written in Python which defers the actual taking of the screenshot to the built-in OS tools (macOS and Windows) or common utilities (Linux distributions). The server is written as a RESTful FastAPI app with support for basic user accounts and image sharing options.## Compatibility* Python &gt;= 3.6 (check with `python --version`)The following OSes have off-the-shelf compatibility.
