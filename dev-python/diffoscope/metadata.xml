It will recursively unpack archives of many kindsand transform various binary formats into more human-readable form tocompare them. It can compare two tarballs, ISO images, or PDF just aseasily.It can be scripted through error codes, and a report can be producedwith the detected differences. The report can be text or HTML.When no type of report has been selected, diffoscope defaultsto write a text report on the standard output.diffoscope was initially started by the &quot;reproducible builds&quot; Debianproject and now being developed as part of the (wider) `“ReproducibleBuilds” initiative &lt;https://reproducible-builds.org&gt;`_.  It is meantto be able to quickly understand why two builds of the same packageproduce different outputs. diffoscope was previously named debbindiff.See the ``COMMAND-LINE EXAMPLES`` section further below to get youstarted, as well as more detailed explanations of all the command-lineoptions. The same information is also available in``/usr/share/doc/diffoscope/README.rst`` or similar... the below hack gets rid of the python &quot;usage&quot; message in favour of the the   synopsis we manually defined in doc/$(PACKAGE).h2m.0   .SS positional arguments:   .\&quot; end_of_description_headerExit status===========Exit status is 0 if inputs are the same, 1 if different, 2 if trouble.Command-line examples=====================To compare two files in-depth and produce an HTML report, run something like::    $ bin/diffoscope --html output.html build1.changes build2.changesdiffoscope will exit with 0 if there's no differences and 1 if thereare.To get all possible options, run::    $ bin/diffoscope --helpIf you have enough RAM, you can improve performance by running::    $ TMPDIR=/run/shm bin/diffoscope very-big-input-0/ very-big-input-1/By default this allowed to use up half of RAM; for more add something like::    tmpfs   /run/shm    tmpfs   size=80%    0   0to your ``/etc/fstab``; see ``man mount`` for details.External dependencies=====================diffoscope requires Python 3 and the following modules available on PyPI:`libarchive-c &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/libarchive-c&gt;`_,`python-magic &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-magic&gt;`_.The various comparators rely on external commands being available. Toget a list of them, please run::    $ bin/diffoscope --list-toolsContributors============Lunar, Reiner Herrmann, Chris Lamb, Mattia Rizzolo, Ximin Luo, Helmut Grohne,Holger Levsen, Daniel Kahn Gillmor, Paul Gevers, Peter De Wachter, YasushiSHOJI, Clemens Lang, Ed Maste, Joachim Breitner, Mike McQuaid.
