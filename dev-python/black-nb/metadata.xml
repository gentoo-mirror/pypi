You can list them by running `black-nb --help`:```textUsage: black-nb [OPTIONS] [SRC]...  The uncompromising code formatter, for Jupyter notebooks.Options:  -l, --line-length INTEGER  How many characters per line to allow.  [default:                             88]  --check                    Don't write the files back, just return the                             status.  Return code 0 means nothing would                             change.  Return code 1 means some files would be                             reformatted.  Return code 123 means there was an                             internal error.  --include TEXT             A regular expression that matches files and                             directories that should be included on recursive                             searches.  An empty value means all files are                             included regardless of the name.  Use forward                             slashes for directories on all platforms                             (Windows, too).  Exclusions are calculated first,                             inclusions later.  [default: \.ipynb$]  --exclude TEXT             A regular expression that matches files and                             directories that should be excluded on recursive                             searches. An empty value means no paths are                             excluded. Use forward slashes for directories on                             all platforms (Windows, too). Exclusions are                             calculated first, inclusions later.  [default: /(                             \.git|\.hg|\.mypy_cache|\.nox|\.tox|\.venv|_build                             |buck-out|build|dist|\.ipynb_checkpoints)/]  --extend-exclude  TEXT     Like --exclude, but adds additional files and                             directories on top of the excluded ones.                             (Useful if you simply want to add to the default)  --force-exclude   TEXT     Like --exclude, but files and directories matching                             this regex will be excluded even when they are                             passed explicitly as arguments.  --stdin-filename  TEXT     The name of the file when passing it through stdin.                             Useful to make sure Black will respect --force-exclude                             option on some editors that rely on using stdin.  -q, --quiet                Don't emit non-error messages to stderr. Errors                             are still emitted, silence those with                             2&gt;/dev/null.  -v, --verbose              Also emit messages to stderr about files that                             were not changed or were ignored due to                             --exclude=.  --clear-output             Clear cell output as part of formatting.  --config FILE              Read configuration from PATH.  -h, --help                 Show this message and exit.```## CopyrightCopyright Â© 2019 Tom Catling, Liam Coatman.`black-nb` is distributed under the terms of the [MIT licence].[mit licence]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT</longdescription>
