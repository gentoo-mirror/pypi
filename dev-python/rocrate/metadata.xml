It currently supports the [RO-Crate 1.1](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1) specification.## Installationro-crate-py requires Python 3.7 or later. The easiest way to install is via [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/):```pip install rocrate```To install manually from this code base (e.g., to try the latest development revision):```git clone https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-pycd ro-crate-pypip install .```## Usage### Creating an RO-CrateIn its simplest form, an RO-Crate is a directory tree with an `ro-crate-metadata.json` file at the top level that contains metadata about the other files and directories, represented by [data entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/data-entities.html). These metadata consist both of properties of the data entities themselves and of other, non-digital entities called [contextual entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/contextual-entities.html) (representing, e.g., a person or an organization).Suppose Alice and Bob worked on a research task together, which resulted in a manuscript written by both; additionally, Alice prepared a spreadsheet containing the experimental data, which Bob used to generate a diagram. Let's make an RO-Crate to package all this:```pythonfrom rocrate.rocrate import ROCratecrate = ROCrate()paper = crate.add_file(&quot;exp/paper.pdf&quot;, properties={    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;manuscript&quot;,    &quot;encodingFormat&quot;: &quot;application/pdf&quot;})table = crate.add_file(&quot;exp/results.csv&quot;, properties={    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;experimental data&quot;,    &quot;encodingFormat&quot;: &quot;text/csv&quot;})diagram = crate.add_file(&quot;exp/diagram.svg&quot;, dest_path=&quot;images/figure.svg&quot;, properties={    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;bar chart&quot;,    &quot;encodingFormat&quot;: &quot;image/svg+xml&quot;})```We've started by adding the data entities. Now we need contextual entities to represent Alice and Bob:```pythonfrom rocrate.model.person import Personalice_id = &quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000&quot;bob_id = &quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001&quot;alice = crate.add(Person(crate, alice_id, properties={    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice Doe&quot;,    &quot;affiliation&quot;: &quot;University of Flatland&quot;}))bob = crate.add(Person(crate, bob_id, properties={    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Bob Doe&quot;,    &quot;affiliation&quot;: &quot;University of Flatland&quot;}))```Next, we express authorship of the various files:```pythonpaper[&quot;author&quot;] = [alice, bob]table[&quot;author&quot;] = alicediagram[&quot;author&quot;] = bob```Finally, we serialize the crate to disk:```pythoncrate.write(&quot;exp_crate&quot;)```Now the `exp_crate` directory should contain copies of the three files and an `ro-crate-metadata.json` file with a JSON-LD serialization of the entities and relationships we created, according to the RO-Crate profile. Note that we have chosen a different destination path for the diagram, while the other two files have been placed at the top level with their names unchanged (the default).Some applications and services support RO-Crates stored as archives. To save the crate in zip format, use `write_zip`:```pythoncrate.write_zip(&quot;exp_crate.zip&quot;)```You can also add whole directories. A directory in RO-Crate is represented by the `Dataset` entity:```pythonlogs = crate.add_dataset(&quot;exp/logs&quot;)```Note that the above adds all files and directories contained in `&quot;exp/logs&quot;` recursively to the crate, but only the top-level `&quot;exp/logs&quot;` dataset itself is listed in the metadata file (there is no requirement to represent every file and folder in the JSON-LD). To also add files and directory recursively to the metadata, use `add_tree` (but note that it only works on local directory trees).#### Appending elements to property valuesWhat ro-crate-py entities actually store is their JSON representation:```pythonpaper.properties()``````json{  &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;paper.pdf&quot;,  &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;File&quot;,  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;manuscript&quot;,  &quot;encodingFormat&quot;: &quot;application/pdf&quot;,  &quot;author&quot;: [    {&quot;@id&quot;: &quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000&quot;},    {&quot;@id&quot;: &quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001&quot;},  ]}```When `paper[&quot;author&quot;]` is accessed, a new list containing the `alice` and `bob` entities is generated on the fly. For this reason, calling `append` on `paper[&quot;author&quot;]` won't actually modify the `paper` entity in any way. To add an author, use the `append_to` method instead:```pythondonald = crate.add(Person(crate, &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Duck&quot;))paper.append_to(&quot;author&quot;, donald)```Note that `append_to` also works if the property to be updated is missing or has only one value:```pythonfor n in &quot;Mickey_Mouse&quot;, &quot;Scrooge_McDuck&quot;:    p = crate.add(Person(crate, f&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{n}&quot;))    donald.append_to(&quot;follows&quot;, p)```#### Adding remote entitiesData entities can also be remote:```pythoninput_data = crate.add_file(&quot;http://example.org/exp_data.zip&quot;)```By default the file won't be downloaded, and will be referenced by its URI in the serialized crate:```json{  &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;http://example.org/exp_data.zip&quot;,  &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;File&quot;},```If you add `fetch_remote=True` to the `add_file` call, however, the library (when `crate.write` is called) will try to download the file and include it in the output crate.Another option that influences the behavior when dealing with remote entities is `validate_url`, also `False` by default: if it's set to `True`, when the crate is serialized, the library will try to open the URL to add / update metadata bits such as the content's length and format (but it won't try to download the file unless `fetch_remote` is also set).#### Adding entities with an arbitrary typeAn entity can be of any type listed in the [RO-Crate context](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/context.jsonld). However, only a few of them have a counterpart (e.g., `File`) in the library's class hierarchy (either because they are very common or because they are associated with specific functionality that can be conveniently embedded in the class implementation). In other cases, you can explicitly pass the type via the `properties` argument:```pythonfrom rocrate.model.contextentity import ContextEntityhackathon = crate.add(ContextEntity(crate, &quot;#bh2021&quot;, properties={    &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;Hackathon&quot;,    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Biohackathon 2021&quot;,    &quot;location&quot;: &quot;Barcelona, Spain&quot;,    &quot;startDate&quot;: &quot;2021-11-08&quot;,    &quot;endDate&quot;: &quot;2021-11-12&quot;}))```Note that entities can have multiple types, e.g.:```python    &quot;@type&quot; = [&quot;File&quot;, &quot;SoftwareSourceCode&quot;]```#### Modifying the crate from JSON-LD dictionariesThe `add_jsonld` method allows to add a contextual entity directly from aJSON-LD dictionary containing at least the `@id` and `@type` keys:```pythoncrate.add_jsonld({    &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000&quot;,    &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;Person&quot;,    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice Doe&quot;})```Existing entities can be updated from JSON-LD dictionaries via `update_jsonld`:```pythoncrate.update_jsonld({    &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000&quot;,    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice K. Doe&quot;})```There is also an `add_or_update_jsonld` method that adds the entity if it'snot already in the crate and updates it if it already exists (note that, whenupdating, the `@type` key is ignored). This allows to &quot;patch&quot; an RO-Crate froma JSON-LD file. For instance, suppose you have the following `patch.json` file:```json{    &quot;@graph&quot;: [        {            &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;./&quot;,            &quot;author&quot;: {&quot;@id&quot;: &quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001&quot;}        },        {            &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001&quot;,            &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;Person&quot;,            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Bob Doe&quot;        }    ]}```Then the following sets Bob as the author of the crate according to the abovefile:```pythoncrate = ROCrate(&quot;temp-crate&quot;)with open(&quot;patch.json&quot;) as f:    json_data = json.load(f)for d in json_data.get(&quot;@graph&quot;, []):    crate.add_or_update_jsonld(d)```### Consuming an RO-CrateAn existing RO-Crate package can be loaded from a directory or zip file:```pythoncrate = ROCrate('exp_crate')  # or ROCrate('exp_crate.zip')for e in crate.get_entities():    print(e.id, e.type)``````ro-crate-metadata.json CreativeWork./ Datasetpaper.pdf Fileresults.csv Fileimages/figure.svg Filehttps://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000 Personhttps://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001 Person```The first two entities shown in the output are the [metadata file descriptor](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/metadata.html) and the [root data entity](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/root-data-entity.html), respectively. These are special entities managed by the `ROCrate` object, and are always present. The other entities are the ones we added in the [section on RO-Crate creation](#creating-an-ro-crate). You can access data entities with `crate.data_entities` and contextual entities with `crate.contextual_entities`. For instance:```pythonfor e in crate.data_entities:    author = e.get(&quot;author&quot;)    if not author:        continue    elif isinstance(author, list):        print(e.id, [p[&quot;name&quot;] for p in author])    else:        print(e.id, repr(author[&quot;name&quot;]))``````paper.pdf ['Alice Doe', 'Bob Doe']results.csv 'Alice Doe'images/figure.svg 'Bob Doe'```You can fetch an entity by its `@id` as follows:```pythonarticle = crate.dereference(&quot;paper.pdf&quot;)```## Command Line Interface`ro-crate-py` includes a hierarchical command line interface: the `rocrate` tool. `rocrate` is the top-level command, while specific functionalities are provided via sub-commands. Currently, the tool allows to initialize a directory tree as an RO-Crate (`rocrate init`) and to modify the metadata of an existing RO-Crate (`rocrate add`).```console$ rocrate --helpUsage: rocrate [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...Options:  --help  Show this message and exit.Commands:  add  init  write-zip```### Crate initializationThe `rocrate init` command explores a directory tree and generates an RO-Crate metadata file (`ro-crate-metadata.json`) listing all files and directories as `File` and `Dataset` entities, respectively.```console$ rocrate init --helpUsage: rocrate init [OPTIONS]Options:  --gen-preview  -e, --exclude CSV  -c, --crate-dir PATH  --help                Show this message and exit.```The command acts on the current directory, unless the `-c` option is specified. The metadata file is added (overwritten if present) to the directory at the top level, turning it into an RO-Crate.### Adding items to the crateThe `rocrate add` command allows to add workflows and other entity types (currently [testing-related metadata](https://crs4.github.io/life_monitor/workflow_testing_ro_crate)) to an RO-Crate:```console$ rocrate add --helpUsage: rocrate add [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...Options:  --help  Show this message and exit.Commands:  test-definition  test-instance  test-suite  workflow```Note that data entities (e.g., workflows) must already be present in the directory tree: the effect of the command is to register them in the metadata file.### Example```bash# From the ro-crate-py repository rootcd test/test-data/ro-crate-galaxy-sortchangecase```This directory is already an RO-Crate. Delete the metadata file to get a plain directory tree:```bashrm ro-crate-metadata.json```Now the directory tree contains several files and directories, including a Galaxy workflow and a Planemo test file, but it's not an RO-Crate since there is no metadata file. Initialize the crate:```bashrocrate init```This creates an `ro-crate-metadata.json` file that lists files and directories rooted at the current directory. Note that the Galaxy workflow is listed as a plain `File`:```json{  &quot;@id&quot;: &quot;sort-and-change-case.ga&quot;,  &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;File&quot;}```To register the workflow as a `ComputationalWorkflow`:```bashrocrate add workflow -l galaxy sort-and-change-case.ga```Now the workflow has a type of `[&quot;File&quot;, &quot;SoftwareSourceCode&quot;, &quot;ComputationalWorkflow&quot;]` and points to a `ComputerLanguage` entity that represents the Galaxy workflow language. Also, the workflow is listed as the crate's `mainEntity` (see the [Workflow RO-Crate profile](https://w3id.org/workflowhub/workflow-ro-crate/1.0)).To add [workflow testing metadata](https://crs4.github.io/life_monitor/workflow_testing_ro_crate) to the crate:```bashrocrate add test-suite -i test1rocrate add test-instance test1 http://example.com -r jobs -i test1_1rocrate add test-definition test1 test/test1/sort-and-change-case-test.yml -e planemo -v '&gt;=0.70'```## License * Copyright 2019-2023 The University of Manchester, UK * Copyright 2020-2023 Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB), BE * Copyright 2020-2023 Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), ES * Copyright 2020-2023 Center for Advanced Studies, Research and Development in Sardinia (CRS4), IT * Copyright 2022-2023 École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, CHLicensed under the Apache License, version 2.0 &lt;https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&gt;, see the file `LICENSE.txt` for details.## Cite as[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/216605684.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/216605684)The above DOI corresponds to the latest versioned release as [published to Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3956493), where you will find all earlier releases.
