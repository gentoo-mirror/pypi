Theclass has several methods including init, validate_url, clean_url, soup, get, and get_all. The init method takes in aURL, a user agent, cookies, and a clean flag. The validate_url method checks if the URL is valid and the clean_urlmethod removes any query parameters from the URL. The soup method makes a request to the URL and returns a BeautifulSoupobject of the webpage. The get method takes in a list of Tag objects and returns a dictionary of the extracted data. Theget_all method takes in a target tag, an items tag, and a list of tags and returns a list of dictionaries of theextracted data for each item. The class also has the ability to handle errors and provide information about theextraction process.These functions can used on python versions 3.8 or greater.References for more help: https://github.com/digipodium/dputilsThank you for using dputils!</longdescription>
