	<longdescription>===================== Javascript Minifier=====================rJSmin is a javascript minifier written in python.The minifier is based on the semantics of `jsmin.c by Douglas Crockford`_\.The module is a re-implementation aiming for speed, so it can be used atruntime (rather than during a preprocessing step). Usually it produces thesame results as the original ``jsmin.c``. It differs in the following ways:- there is no error detection: unterminated string, regex and comment  literals are treated as regular javascript code and minified as such.- Control characters inside string and regex literals are left untouched; they  are not converted to spaces (nor to \n)- Newline characters are not allowed inside string and regex literals, except  for line continuations in string literals (ECMA-5).- &quot;return /regex/&quot; is recognized correctly.- More characters are allowed before regexes.- Line terminators after regex literals are handled more sensibly- &quot;+ +&quot; and &quot;- -&quot; sequences are not collapsed to '++' or '--'- Newlines before ! operators are removed more sensibly- (Unnested) template literals are supported (ECMA-6)- Comments starting with an exclamation mark (``!``) can be kept optionally- rJSmin does not handle streams, but only complete strings. (However, the  module provides a &quot;streamy&quot; interface).Since most parts of the logic are handled by the regex engine it's way fasterthan the original python port of ``jsmin.c`` by Baruch Even. The speed factorvaries between about 6 and 55 depending on input and python version (it getsfaster the more compressed the input already is).  Compared to thespeed-refactored python port by Dave St.Germain the performance gain is lessdramatic but still between 3 and 50 (for huge inputs)). See thedocs/BENCHMARKS file for details.rjsmin.c is a reimplementation of rjsmin.py in C and speeds it up even more.Supported python versions are 2.7 and 3.6+... _jsmin.c by Douglas Crockford: http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.cCopyright and License~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Copyright 2011 - 2022André Malo or his licensors, as applicable.The whole package (except for the files in the bench/ directory) isdistributed under the Apache License Version 2.0.
