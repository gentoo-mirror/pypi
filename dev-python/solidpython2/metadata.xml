	<longdescription>SolidPython===========   OpenSCAD for Python-------------------SolidPython is a generalization of Phillip Tiefenbacher's openscadmodule, found on `Thingiverse &lt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1481&gt;`__. Itgenerates valid OpenSCAD code from Python code with minimal overhead. Here's asimple example:This Python code:.. code:: python    from solid2 import *    d = cube(5) + sphere(5).right(5) - cylinder(r=2, h=6)Generates this OpenSCAD code:.. code::    difference(){        union(){            cube(5);            translate( [5, 0,0]){                sphere(5);            }        }        cylinder(r=2, h=6);    }As can be clearly seen, the SolidPython code is a lot shorter (and I think a lot better readable and maintainable) than the OpenSCAD code it compiles to.Advantages----------In contrast to OpenSCAD -- which is a constrained domain specific language --Python is a full blown modern programming language and as such supportspretty much all modern programming features. Furthermore a huge number oflibraries is available.SolidPython lets you use all these fancy python features to generate yourconstructive solid geometry models.On the one hand it makes the generation of your models a lot easier, becauseyou don't need to learn another domain specific language and you can use allthe programming technique you're already familiar with. On the other hand itgives you a lot more power, because you can use all the comprehensive pythonlibraries to generate your models.Getting Started---------------The `wiki &lt;https://github.com/jeff-dh/SolidPython/wiki&gt;`__ is the place to look for docs and tutorials. Furthermore the `examples &lt;https://github.com/jeff-dh/SolidPython/tree/master-2.0.0-beta-dev/solid2/examples&gt;`__ might be interesting to you too.Contact=======Enjoy!If you have any questions or bug reports please report them to the SolidPython`GitHub page &lt;https://github.com/jeff-dh/SolidPython&gt;`__!Cheers!License=======This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify itunder the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (atyour option) any later version.This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, butWITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty ofMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
