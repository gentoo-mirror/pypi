	<longdescription># FonetikaRussian, English, Sweden, Estonian and Finnish Phonetic algorithm based on Soundex/Metaphone.Package has both implemented phoneme transformation into letter-number sequence and distance engine for comparison of phonetic sequences (based on Levenstein and Hamming distances).Furthermore, both Russian phonetic algorithms supports preprocessing for specific phoneme cases.### Quick start1. Install this package via ```pip``````pythonpip install fonetika```2. Import Soundex algorithm.Package supports a lot of opportunities, it's possible to cut a result sequence (like in the original Soundex version) or also code vowels.```pythonfrom fonetika.soundex import RussianSoundexsoundex = RussianSoundex(delete_first_letter=True)soundex.transform('ёлочка')...J070530soundex = RussianSoundex(delete_first_letter=True, code_vowels=True)soundex.transform('ёлочка')...JA7A53A```&gt; A structure of the library is scalable, `RussianSoundex` class inherits basic class `Soundex` (original for English language). In order to extend our algorithm, you need just inherit own class from `Soundex` and override methods.3. Import Soundex distance for usage of string comparision```pythonfrom fonetika.distance import PhoneticsInnerLanguageDistancesoundex = RussianSoundex(delete_first_letter=True)phon_distance = PhoneticsInnerLanguageDistance(soundex)phon_distance.distance('ёлочка', 'йолочка')...0```4. You can also calculate distance between words of two languages. It would be useful for working with one language family group.```pythonfrom fonetika.distance import PhoneticsBetweenLanguagesDistancem1 = FinnishMetaphone(reduce_word=False)m2 = EstonianMetaphone(reduce_word=False)phon_distance = PhoneticsBetweenLanguagesDistance(m1, m2)phon_distance.distance('yö', 'öö')...1```</longdescription>
