In particular, the following rules are verified:- Whether the work time is longer than 6 hours without a break of 30 min- Whether the work time is longer than 9 hours without a break of 45 min- Whether the work time is longer than 10 hours without a break of 11 hoursIt also provides a way to fetch the attendances of all employees from [FactorialHR](https://apidoc.factorialhr.com/docs) using a [company api-key](https://help.factorialhr.com/how-to-create-api-keys-in-factorial).![main_window](./docs/images/main_window.png &quot;Main Window&quot;)## DisclaimerI do not guarantee that this package complies with german law all the time. Changes may occur anytime. Use at your own risk.Errors where the time attended is 1 min above the limit are ignored, because factorial's automated time tracking is not precises enough.## Usage- Install the tool with `pip install fwtv`- Run tool with `factorial-working-time`### PreconditionsPreconditions errors are syntactical errors like an attendance that starts and end and the same time, or if a `clock_in` or `clock_out` parameter is missing.## ContributingFeel free to contribute! Please fork this repository, install the development dependencies with `pip install -e &quot;.[dev]&quot;` and create pull request.</longdescription>
