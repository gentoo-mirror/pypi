This will of course change the resultingCSV files, but Excel will not display the ``'`` character to the user.Tested with Python 3.8 to 3.10.Usage-----This library acts as a drop-in replacement for the standard library's ``csv`` module. You can use it by just replacing``import csv`` with ``from defusedcsv import csv`` in your code.Useful Links------------* `CSV Injection Software Attack | OWASP Foundation &lt;https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/CSV_Injection&gt;`_* `Comma Separated Vulnerabilities | Context Information Security &lt;https://www.contextis.com/resources/blog/comma-separated-vulnerabilities/&gt;`_* `CSV Injection Mitigations &amp; Dangers | ZeroSec - Adventures In Information Security &lt;https://blog.zsec.uk/csv-dangers-mitigations/&gt;`_License-------The code in this repository is published under the terms of the Apache License.
