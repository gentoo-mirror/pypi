	<longdescription># poetry-plugin-pypi-mirror## Description*poetry-plugin-pypi-mirror* is a[plugin](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/plugins/) for[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), the Python packaging and dependencymanager. It enables poetry to substitute connections to pypi.org withconnections to a pypi.org mirror or pull-through cache **without requiringproject configuration changes**. This is ideal for situations where anaccess-restricted or otherwise unsuitable-for-general-use pypi.org mirror mustbe used by a subset of project contributors. For example:* A private PyPI mirror internal to a business, required by company policy* A limited-access PyPI mirror in a region where pypi.org is restricted* A regional mirror that is more performant for a few users, and less performant  for everyone elseThese mirrors can be used without this plugin by [adding them as projectrepositories](https://python-poetry.org/docs/repositories/). However, thisrequires the mirror to be included in the project's configuration, and this alsoresults in source entries for the mirror appearing in `poetry.lock`. Since onlya subset of project contributors can use these mirrors, that subset of userswould need to replace and remove references to the mirror repository each timethey want to contribute their changes back to the project. This is suboptimal.## Usage### InstallationFollow poetry's [plugin installation instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/plugins/#using-plugins), replacing `poetry-plugin` with `poetry-plugin-pypi-mirror`.### Specifying a mirrorTo specify a mirror, you can either define `plugins.pypi_mirror.url` in poetry's[configuration](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/), or setenvironment variable `POETRY_PYPI_MIRROR_URL` to the full URL for a [PEP503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)-compatible mirror. When both are set theenvironment variable will be used.#### Poetry config example```toml[plugins][plugins.pypi_mirror]url = &quot;https://example.org/repository/pypi-proxy/simple/&quot;```... in [either](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/) a project's`poetry.toml` (for per-project configuration), or the user's `config.toml`.#### Environment variable example```shellPOETRY_PYPI_MIRROR_URL=https://example.org/repository/pypi-proxy/simple/ poetry add pendulum```...or...```shellexport POETRY_PYPI_MIRROR_URL=https://example.org/repository/pypi-proxy/simple/poetry add cleo # uses mirror specified in first linepoetry lock     # also uses mirror specified in first line```## Compatibility*poetry-plugin-pypi-mirror* depends on poetry internals which can change betweenpoetry releases. It's important to ensure compatibility between the poetryversion in use and the plugin version in use.| Poetry version(s) | Compatible plugin version(s) ||-------------------|------------------------------|| &gt;= 1.3, &lt; 1.6     | ^0.3.1                       || ~1.2.1            | &lt; 0.3.0                      |## See also* [python-poetry/poetry#1632](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1632) - poetry feature request to add support for global repository URL replacement</longdescription>
