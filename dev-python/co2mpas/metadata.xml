	<longdescription>What is CO2MPAS?****************CO2MPAS is backward-looking longitudinal-dynamics CO2 andfuel-consumption simulator for light-duty M1 &amp; N1 vehicles (cars andvans), specially crafted to *estimate the CO2 emissions of vehiclesundergoing NEDC* testing based on the emissions produced *WLTPtesting* during type-approval, according to the EU legislations*1152/EUR/2017 and 1153/EUR/2017* (see `History`_ section, below).It is an open-source project (`EUPL 1.1+&lt;https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/page/eupl&gt;`_) developed forPython-3.6+. It runs either as a *console command* or as a *desktopGUI application*, and it uses Excel-files or pure python structures(dictionary and lists) for its input &amp; output data.History=======The *European Commission* has introduced the *WLTP* as the testprocedure for the type I test of the European type-approval ofLight-duty vehicles as of September 2017. Its introduction hasrequired the adaptation of CO2 certification and monitoring proceduresset by European regulations (443/2009, 510/2011, 1152/EUR/2017 and1153/EUR/2017). European Commissionâ€™s *Joint Research Centre* (JRC)has been assigned the development of this vehicle simulator tofacilitate this adaptation.The European Regulation setting the conditions for using CO2MPAS canbe found in `the Comitology Register&lt;http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regcomitology/index.cfm?do=search.documentdetail&amp;dos_id=0&amp;ds_id=45835&amp;version=2&gt;`_after its adoption by the *Climate Change Committee* which took placeon June 23, 2016, and its 2nd vote for modifications, in April 27,2017.Installation************To install CO2MPAS use (with root privileges):.. code:: console   $ pip install co2mpasOr download the latest git version and use (with root privileges):.. code:: console   $ python setup.py installSome additional functionality is enabled installing the followingextras:*  ``cli``: enables the command line interface.*  ``sync``: enables the time series synchronization tool (i.e.,   `syncing &lt;https://github.com/vinci1it2000/syncing&gt;`_ previously   named ``datasync``).*  ``gui``: enables the graphical user interface.*  ``plot``: enables to plot the CO2MPAS model and the workflow of   each run.*  ``io``: enables to read/write excel files.*  ``driver``: enables the driver model (currently is not available).To install co2mpas and all extras, do:.. code:: console   $ pip install 'co2mpas[all]'</longdescription>
