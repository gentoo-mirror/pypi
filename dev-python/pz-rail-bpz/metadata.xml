Anyone using BPZ via either rail_bpz or DESC_BPZ should cite both [Benitez (2000)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...536..571B/abstract) and [Coe et al. (2006)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AJ....132..926C/abstract).As the &quot;lite&quot; name implies, not all features of BPZ are implemented, the main product is the marginalized redshift PDF, which is output for a sample as a `qp` ensemble.  However, several other quantities are computed and stored as &quot;ancillary&quot; data and stored with the ensemble, these are:- zmode (float): the mode of the marginalized posterior redshift PDF distribution.- zmean (float): the mean of the marginalized posterior redshift PDF distribution.- tb (int): the integer index for the &quot;best-fit&quot; SED template **at the redshift mode, `zmode`**.  Note that the best-fit template can be different at different redshifts as the SED observed colors change with redshift, so you **can not** assume this single SED for the full marginalized PDF, it should only be used for the &quot;point estimate&quot; redshift `zmode`.- todds (float): relating to the comment above on tb, `todds` is a new quantity not included with the original BPZ implementation, it is the fraction of marginalized posterior probability assigned to `tb`.  So, high values of `todds` would mean that no other templates fit well, even at other redshifts, while a lower value of `todds` means that there are alternative fits, either at the same redshift or other redshifts.  If you are wanting to compute physical quantities based on `tb`, a lower value of `todds` would mean that such fits would be missing degenerate SED solutions, and should not be trusted.</longdescription>
