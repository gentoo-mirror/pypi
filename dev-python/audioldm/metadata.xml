Try to provide more hints to AudioLDM, such as using more adjectives to describe your sound (e.g., clearly, high quality) or make your target more specific (e.g., &quot;water stream in a forest&quot; instead of &quot;stream&quot;). This can make sure AudioLDM understand what you want. 2. Try to use different random seeds, which can affect the generation quality significantly sometimes.3. It's best to use general terms like 'man' or 'woman' instead of specific names for individuals or abstract objects that humans may not be familiar with.# Change Log**2023-04-10**: Try to finetune AudioLDM with MusicCaps and AudioCaps datasets. Add three more checkpoints, including audioldm-m-text-ft, audioldm-s-text-ft, and audioldm-m-full.**2023-03-04**: Add two more checkpoints, one is small model with more training steps, another is a large model. Add model selection in the Gradio APP.**2023-02-24**: Add audio-to-audio generation. Add test cases. Add a pipeline (python function) for audio super-resolution and inpainting.**2023-02-15**: Add audio style transfer. Add more options on generation.## Web APPThe web APP currently only support Text-to-Audio generation. For full functionality please refer to the [Commandline Usage](https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM#commandline-usage).1. Prepare running environment```shellconda create -n audioldm python=3.8; conda activate audioldmpip3 install audioldmgit clone https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM; cd AudioLDM```2. Start the web application (powered by Gradio)```shellpython3 app.py```3. A link will be printed out.
