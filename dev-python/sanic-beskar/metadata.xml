Why not -- whatis better than star wars (provided you ignore the fact ~the mandolorian~was almost as lame as ~book of boba fett~)?Superior armour should be used if you want superior protection.This package aims to provide that. Using token implemented by either`PySETO &lt;https://pyseto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_ or`PyJWT &lt;https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_,*sanic-beskar* uses a very simple interface to make sure that the usersaccessing your API's endpoints are provisioned with the correct roles foraccess.The goal of this project is to offer simplistic protection, withoutforcing nonsense, excessivly complicatated implimentation, ormandated/opinionated ORM usage. Providing this usability for smallscaled Sanic applications, while allowing the flexibility andscalability for enterprise grade solutions, seperates this from yourother options.The *sanic-beskar* package can be used to:* Hash passwords for storing in your database* Verify plaintext passwords against the hashed, stored versions* Generate authorization tokens upon verification of passwords* Check requests to secured endpoints for authorized tokens* Supply expiration of tokens and mechanisms for refreshing them* Ensure that the users associated with tokens have necessary roles for access* Parse user information from request headers for use in client route handlers* Support inclusion of custom user claims in tokens* Register new users using email verification* Support OTP authentication as a dual factor* Provide RBAC based protection of endpoints and resourcesAll of this is provided in a very simple to configure and initialize flaskextension. Though simple, the security provided by *sanic-beskar* is strongdue to the usage of the proven security technology of PASETO or JWT, along withpython's `PassLib &lt;http://pythonhosted.org/passlib/&gt;`_ package.Super-quick Start----------------- - requirements: `python` versions 3.7+ - install through pip: `$ pip install sanic-beskar` - minimal usage example: `example/basic.py &lt;https://github.com/pahrohfit/sanic-beskar/tree/master/example/basic.py&gt;`_Documentation-------------The complete documentation can be found at the`sanic-beskar home page &lt;http://sanic-beskar.readthedocs.io&gt;`_</longdescription>
