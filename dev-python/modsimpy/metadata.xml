	<longdescription>ModSimPython============Supporting code for Modeling and Simulation in Python.  `This &lt;http://greenteapress.com/wp/modsimpy/&gt;`__ and other Free Books byAllen Downey are available from `Green TeaPress &lt;http://greenteapress.com/wp&gt;`__.You can run the code from the repository in a browser by pressing theBinder button below.|Binder|*Modeling and Simulation in Python* is an introduction to physicalmodeling using a computational approach. It is organized in three parts:-  The first part presents discrete models, including a bikeshare system   and world population growth.-  The second part introduces first-order systems, including models of   infectious disease, thermal systems, and pharmacokinetics.-  The third part is about second-order systems, including mechanical   systems like projectiles, celestial mechanics, and rotating rigid   bodies.Taking a computational approach makes it possible to work with morerealistic models than what you typically see in a first-year physicsclass, with the option to include features like friction and drag.Python is an ideal programming language for this material. It is a goodfirst language for people who have not programmed before, and itprovides high-level data structures that are well-suited to expresssolutions to the problems we are interested in.*Modeling and Simulation in Python* is a Free Book. It is availableunder the `Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 UnportedLicense &lt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/&gt;`__, whichmeans that you are free to copy, distribute, and modify it, as long asyou attribute the work and don't use it for commercial purposes.Getting started---------------To run the examples and work on the exercises in this book, you have to:1. Install Python on your computer, along with the libraries we will   use.2. Copy my files onto your computer.3. Run Jupyter, which is a tool for running and writing programs, and   load a **notebook**, which is a file that contains code and text.The next three sections provide details for these steps. I wish therewere an easier way to get started; it's regrettable that you have to doso much work before you write your first program. Be persistent!Installing Python-----------------You might already have Python installed on your computer, but you mightnot have the latest version. To use the code in this book, you needPython 3.6 or later. Even if you have the latest version, you probablydon't have all of the libraries we need.You could update Python and install these libraries, but I stronglyrecommend that you don't go down that road. I think you will find iteasier to use **Anaconda**, which is a free Python distribution thatincludes all the libraries you need for this book (and more).Anaconda is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. By default, it putsall files in your home directory, so you don't need administrator (root)permission to install it, and if you have a version of Python already,Anaconda will not remove or modify it.Start at `the Anaconda downloadpage &lt;https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section&gt;`__.Download the installer for your system and run it. You don't needadministrative privileges to install Anaconda, so I recommend you runthe installer as a normal user, not as administrator or root.I suggest you accept the recommended options. On Windows you have theoption to install Visual Studio Code, which is an interactiveenvironment for writing programs. You won't need it for this book, butyou might want it for other projects.By default, Anaconda installs most of the packages you need, but thereare a few more you have to add. Once the installation is complete, opena command window. On macOS or Linux, you can use Terminal. On Windows,open the Anaconda Prompt that should be in your Start menu.Run the following command (copy and paste it if you can, to avoidtypos):::   conda install jupyterlab pandas seaborn sympy beautifulsoup4 lxml html5lib pytablesTo install Pint, run this command:::   conda install -c unidata pintAnd to install the ModSim library, run this command:::   pip install modsimThat should be everything you need.Copying my files----------------The simplest way to get the files for this book is to download a `Ziparchive fromGitHub &lt;https://github.com/AllenDowney/ModSimPy/archive/master.zip&gt;`__.You will need a program like WinZip or gzip to unpack the Zip file. Makea note of the location of the files you download.If you download the Zip file, you can skip the rest of this section,which explains how to use Git.The code for this book is available fromhttps://github.com/AllenDowney/ModSimPy, which is a **Git repository**.Git is a software tool that helps you keep track of the programs andother files that make up a project. A collection of files under Git'scontrol is called a repository (the cool kids call it a &quot;repo&quot;). GitHubis a hosting service that provides storage for Git repositories and aconvenient web interface.Before you download these files, I suggest you copy my repository onGitHub, which is called **forking**. If you don't already have a GitHubaccount, you'll need to create one.Use a browser to view the homepage of my repository athttps://github.com/AllenDowney/ModSimPy. You should see a gray button inthe upper right that says Fork. If you press it, GitHub will create acopy of my repository that belongs to you.Now, the best way to download the files is to use a **Git client**,which is a program that manages git repositories. You can getinstallation instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux athttp://modsimpy.com/getgit.In Windows, I suggest you accept the options recommended by theinstaller, with two exceptions:-  As the default editor, choose instead of .-  For &quot;Configuring line ending conversions&quot;, select &quot;Check out as is,   commit as is&quot;.For macOS and Linux, I suggest you accept the recommended options.Once the installation is complete, open a command window. On Windows,open Git Bash, which should be in your Start menu. On macOS or Linux,you can use Terminal.To find out what directory you are in, type &quot;pwd&quot;, which stands for &quot;printworking directory&quot;. On Windows, most likely you are in . On MacOS orLinux, you are probably in your home directory, .The next step is to copy files from your repository on GitHub to yourcomputer; in Git vocabulary, this process is called **cloning**. Runthis command:::   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUserName/ModSimPyOf course, you should replace with your GitHub user name. After cloning,you should have a new directory called .Running Jupyter---------------The code for each chapter, and starter code for the exercises, is inJupyter notebooks. If you have not used Jupyter before, you can readabout it at https://jupyter.org.To start Jupyter on macOS or Linux, open a Terminal; on Windows, openGit Bash. Use &quot;cd&quot; to change directory into the code directory in therepository:::   cd ModSimPy/codeThen launch the Jupyter notebook server:::   jupyter notebookJupyter should open a window in a browser, and you should see the listof notebooks in my repository. Click on the first notebook, and followthe instructions to run the first few &quot;cells&quot;. The first time you run anotebook, it might take several seconds to start, while some Pythonfiles get initialized. After that, it should run faster.Feel free to read through the notebook, but it might not make senseuntil you read Chapter 1.You can also launch Jupyter from the Start menu on Windows, the Dock onmacOS, or the Anaconda Navigator on any system. If you do that, Jupytermight start in your home directory or somewhere else in your filesystem, so you might have to navigate to find the directory... |Binder| image:: https://mybinder.org/badge.svg   :target: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AllenDowney/ModSimPy/master?filepath=notebooks</longdescription>
