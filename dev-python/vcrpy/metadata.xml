Thefirst time you run code that is inside a VCR.py context manager ordecorated function, VCR.py records all HTTP interactions that takeplace through the libraries it supports and serializes and writes themto a flat file (in yaml format by default). This flat file is called acassette. When the relevant piece of code is executed again, VCR.pywill read the serialized requests and responses from theaforementioned cassette file, and intercept any HTTP requests that itrecognizes from the original test run and return the responses thatcorresponded to those requests. This means that the requests will notactually result in HTTP traffic, which confers several benefitsincluding:-  The ability to work offline-  Completely deterministic tests-  Increased test execution speedIf the server you are testing against ever changes its API, all you needto do is delete your existing cassette files, and run your tests again.VCR.py will detect the absence of a cassette file and once again recordall HTTP interactions, which will update them to correspond to the newAPI.Usage with Pytest-----------------There is a library to provide some pytest fixtures called pytest-recording https://github.com/kiwicom/pytest-recordingLicense-------This library uses the MIT license.
