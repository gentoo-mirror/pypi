So the API is not expected to be stable!##  âœ¨ What does Kor excel at?  ðŸŒŸ* Making mistakes! Plenty of them!* Slow! It uses large prompts with examples, and works best with the larger slower LLMs.* Crashing for long enough pieces of text! Context length window could become  limiting when working with large forms or long text inputs.The expectation is that as LLMs improve some of these issues will be mitigated.## LimitationsKor has no limitations. (Just kidding.)Take a look at the section above and at the compatibility section.## Got Ideas?Open an issue, and let's discuss!## ðŸŽ¶ Why the name?Fast to type and sufficiently unique.## ContributingIf you have any ideas or feature requests, please open an issue and share!See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/eyurtsev/kor/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.## Other packagesProbabilistically speaking this package is unlikely to work for your use case.So here are some great alternatives:* [Promptify](https://github.com/promptslab/Promptify)* [MiniChain](https://srush.github.io/MiniChain/examples/stats/)</longdescription>
