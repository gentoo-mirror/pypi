Python version support !2.2 is the last version of Kabaret supporting Python 2. Incoming versions starting from 2.3 will exclusively support Python 3.### ! Breaking changes !The return value of the `session.cmds.Flow.ls()` command has changed to also include the related oid. This is needed by theintroduction of the new `Relative` relation with which you can no longer assume that a related object's id is`&lt;relation_owner_id&gt;/&lt;related_name&gt;`. If you were using `ls` in automation scripts, you will need to update its returned value unpacking.Previous return value:`(relation_name, relation_type, is_action, is_map, ui_config), mapped_names`New return value:`(related_oid, relation_name, relation_type, is_action, is_map, ui_config), mapped_names`### Addedissue #88 - Mapped items &quot;background_color&quot; does show in GUI.issue #99 &amp; #100 - New plugin system to allow code-less intallation of third party extensions. See new &quot;Plugin&quot;section of the documentation: https://kabaret.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugin_system.htmlPePy download badge in READMEissue #79 - New Flow command `session.cmds.Flow.set_home_oid(my_oid)` to configure the &quot;Home&quot; action.issue #83 - New ui option `navigation_bar`. If set to `False`, the flow page will hide the navigation bar.See example usages in showcase `dev_studio.flow.unittest_project.showcase.ui_config`. Also added an entry in the FlowView &quot;Options&quot; menu to toggle the navigation bar visible/hidden.issue #78 - View titles can be formated by using a `view_id` like `&lt;formater&gt;|&lt;view_id&gt;` where formateris used like `formater.format(some_title)`. This particularly interesting to control the title of views created by using `goto_target` in the return value of a `flow.Action.run()`.issue #71 - Action menus for Relation and Map items can contain sub-menus based on the Action group. Use `relation.ui(action_submenus=True)` and/or `relation.ui(items_action_submenus=True)`.issue #60 - Any session created is accessible with `kabaret.app.get_session(my_session_uid)`. You canget the last created one with `kabaret.app.get_session()`.issue #73 - `choice` editor support arbitrary icon for each choice using the `choice_icons` option.issue #11 - `textarea` editor now correctly shows when edited and is correctly auto-applied in action dialogs.A 'Cancel' button was added to revert to the last loaded value. The 'Apply' and 'Cancel' buttons are now hiddenuntil an edit is made. A new option `buttons_side` was added to specify the buttons side.issue #31 - Added the ability to access other projects in the flow with `self.root().project('OtherProjectName')`issue #74 - Added `injectable()` method on `Child` relations (and sub relations) which let developer inject their Object types inside someone else flow using the `kabaret.flow.injection` module. See the documentation at https://kabaret.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/injection.html for details.issue #70 - Customizable double click behaviour on `Map` items. See usage and example in `dev_studio.flow.unittest_project.showcase.maps.map_actions`, and here: https://gitlab.com/kabaretstudio/kabaret/-/issues/70#note_409303471issue #66 - Added a new relation `Relative` which gives access to any Object in the flow given an `oid` relative to its parent. See usage and code example in `dev_studio.flow.unittest_project.showcase.relations`.issue #68 - Added `kabaret.flow.Connection.allow_cross_project()` to allow Connection / Ref toan object inside another project.merge !101 - New GUI Style in `kabaret.app.ui.gui.styles.gray.GrayStyle()`### Changedmerge !128 - The LabelEditor text is now selectable.issue #72 - The target view of a `flow.Action.run()` is automatically made visible / active tab.issue #70 - You can no longer create a Mapped Item with a name used inthe Map class or its ancestor classes.issue #56 - Use scrollbar rather than submenu when having many items in NavigationBar context menusmerge !106 - Change ChoiceValueEditor from QToolButton to QComboBox### Fixedissue #93 - Injections produce too many messages (info messages are now debug only message)issue #95 - Kabaret didn't work with python 3.9issue #30 - Removed the `redis&lt;3.0.0` restriction in `install_requires`.issue #72 - Fixed a bug when the return value of a `flow.Action.run()` has a `goto_target_type` and no `goto_target`.issue #63 - In FlowView: Action buttons, Mapped items and Reference fields where inside the last Relation instead of at view toplevel.issue #77 - 10 times faster FlowView page loading.issue #67 - `KabaretSession.session_uid()` may return a unique id that is rejected by Redis. issue #45 - &quot;Internal C++ object already deleted&quot; error when navigating to a page before current pageloading is finished.issue #53 - Bug in corner case scenarii when listing Object Actions.issue #52 - When a Ref source was updated, it would not be updated for user who already loaded it.issue #57 - Connections relations were always displayed first in GUI.merge !102 - Scroll in MapField does not work in python3 + Fixed MappedItem background and foreground stylingmerge !103 - MultiChoiceValueEditor maximum height / scrollbar + Check multiple choices at oncemerge !104 - Support unicode data in Param (default editor and textarea editor)issue #28 - Dialogless Actions inside an Action dialog closes the parent Action dialog.issue #56 - Navigation Bar drag'n'drop start sensibility and preview.## [2.1.12] - 2020-02-28### Fixedissue #64 - Thumbnail Sequence player fails when image is missing## [2.1.11] - 2020-02-18### Fixedissue #62 - Failling &quot;computed value&quot; showcase in dev_studio.flow.unittest_project.UnittestProjectfixing DarkStyle css not showing the error background for Computed value fields.## [2.1.10] - 2020-02-03### Fixedissue #50 - FlowView: Map is expanded when there's only one Map in the current oidThis is intended and used to be cool.
