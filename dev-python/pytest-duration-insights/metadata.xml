It's built on top of the report that is generated by [pytest-reportlog](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-reportlog). ## Preview We're hosting a demo on GitHub pages. You can view it [here](https://koaning.github.io/pytest-duration-insights/). There's also an educationalvideo announcement on [calmcode.io](https://calmcode.io) found [here](https://calmcode.io/labs/pytest-duration-insights.html).![](gif.gif)## Instructions. ### 1. Install.```pip install pytest-reportlog pytest-duration-insights```### 2. Make a report. ```pytest --report-log reportlog.jsonl```### 3. Explore!```pytest-duration-insights explore reportlog.jsonl```This will start up a service that tries to help you find areas in yourtesting code base that are worth investigating.## Roadmap We're only scratching the surface of what the `reportlog.jsonl` file gives us. We might, forexample, also explore how long it takes to setup/teardown tests. Feedback is appreciated, especially if somebody has a keen insight that has helped in the past.That said, this project is very much an experiment as well. See it as a thing you couldtry rather than a best practice.</longdescription>
