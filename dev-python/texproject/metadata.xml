	<longdescription># TexProject: An automatic LaTeX project manager.TexPRoject is a command-line LaTeX template and project manager written in Python.# Introduction## InstallationOn UNIX-like systems, typically one can install the command-line tool with the following commands:```shpip install texprojectgit clone https://github.com/alexrutar/texproject-templates ~/.local/share/texproject```Texproject complies with the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html); replace `~/.local/share` or `~/.config` with your configured directories.Currently, there is no installation script or package manager support, but I hope to implement this eventually.To configure Texproject, you can generate a global configuration file in the directory `~/.config/texproject/` by running```shmkdir -p ~/.config/texprojecttpr util show-config &gt; ~/.config/texproject/config.toml```## Basic UsageTexproject is installed under the command line tool `tpr`.To create a new project, create an empty directory, change into it, and run```shtpr init &lt;template&gt;```This command will create a new project using the template with name `&lt;template&gt;` in the current directory.To specify a different directory, use the `-C &lt;path&gt;` flag.This creates the files `main.tex` (for primary document contents) and `project-macros.sty` (for project-specific macros).To get a list of available templates, run```shtpr list template```If you are currently in a project file, run```shtpr archive &lt;output.zip&gt;```to create compressed source files for your project in the same directory.If you want to edit parameters of your document (such as citation files, additional macro sets, or other features), run```shtpr template edit```to open the project template file in your `$EDITOR`.When the file is closed, the project is automatically updated.Note that this will not overwrite existing linked files.If you want to overwrite existing files, the `tpr import` function may be useful.For instance, to update the `tikz` macro file, you would run```shtpr import --macro tikz```This subcommand can also be used to import files not in the template repository.If you have a citation file `/path/to/citation.bib`, run```shtpr import --citation-path path/to/new/file.bib```You can then include this file by adding `file` to the `citations` section of the project configuration file.You can also programmatically add new imports as well: in the above example, run```shtpr template add --macro tikz```Read about more features by running```shtpr --helptpr &lt;subcommand&gt; --help```# Other Major Features## Automatic CompilationA number of subcommands used by Texproject use the [latexmk](https://personal.psu.edu/~jcc8/software/latexmk/) program for automatic compilation.This is useful in order to programmatically verify compilation, as well as automatic creation of `.pdf` or `.bbl` files from source files when exporting.For example, to create a compressed export with includes a `.pdf` of the current build, run```shtpr archive output.zip --mode build```Run `tpr validate --help` or `tpr archive --help` for more information on some subcommands which use automatic compilation.## GitHub Repository ManagementTexproject also has an automated tool that is useful for setting up a remote a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com) with convenient continuous integration features.In order to use these features, [git](https://git-scm.com/), along with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), must be installed and properly authenticated.&gt; **_WARNING:_** The commands in this section will create and modify repositories and continuous integration on your GitHub account.In a new project without an initialized `.git` repo, run the command```shtpr git init```to begin an interactive session to set up a new git repo with a remote on GitHub.This command does the following:1. Initializes a new git repository in the working directory.2. Adds the relevant files, and creates a first commit.3. Creates a new GitHub remote, with parameters as specified during the interactive prompt.4. Sets a repository secret `API_TOKEN_GITHUB`, which is used by some of the CI features.In order to see the commands which will be run without executing them, use `tpr -n git init`.### Automatic releasesThis GitHub repository is initialized with a custom action (see `.github/workflows/build.yaml`) which automatically creates GitHub releases for tagged versions on your project.For example, suppose you make some changes to your `.tex` file and commit them to your repository:```shecho &quot;% a comment&quot; &gt;&gt; main.texgit commit --a m &quot;A nice commit message&quot;```Then, create a tag and push the commit along with the tag:```shgit tag v1.0 -m &quot;First release!&quot;git push --follow-tags```Now, after the action has finished running, the compiled files will be visible at the URL `https://github.com/username/reponame/releases`.# Usage Examples## Basic project initializationHere, we demonstrate the construction of a basic project.First, create a project with the name `example` using the `empty` template, and change into the directory.```shmkdir example &amp;&amp; cd exampletpr init empty```The relevant project files in this directory are `main.tex` and `project-macros.sty`.The file `main.tex` file is the main document file which you can edit to produce your document.The `project-macros.sty` file is an empty package in which you can input custom project-dependent preamble.These packages are always loaded after any specified project files.Suppose we want to include the macro set `general` with our project: to do this, run```shtpr template add --macro general```If you want to share this project with someone else, simply run```shtpr archive output.zip```which will generate the file `output.zip` within the project directory.This zipfile contains all the source files required to compile the document.</longdescription>
