	<longdescription>Note: This package is **deprecated**. It is highly preferred that instead ofusing this code base that instead `fasteners`_ or `oslo.concurrency`_ isused instead. For any questions or comments or further help neededplease email `openstack-dev`_ and prefix your email subjectwith ``[oslo][pylockfile]`` (for a faster response)... _fasteners: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fasteners.. _oslo.concurrency: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.concurrency/.. _openstack-dev: http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-devThe lockfile package exports a LockFile class which provides a simple API forlocking files.  Unlike the Windows msvcrt.locking function, the fcntl.lockfand flock functions, and the deprecated posixfile module, the API isidentical across both Unix (including Linux and Mac) and Windows platforms.The lock mechanism relies on the atomic nature of the link (on Unix) andmkdir (on Windows) system calls.  An implementation based on SQLite is alsoprovided, more as a demonstration of the possibilities it provides than asproduction-quality code.Note: In version 0.9 the API changed in two significant ways: * It changed from a module defining several classes to a package containing   several modules, each defining a single class. * Where classes had been named SomethingFileLock before the last two words   have been reversed, so that class is now SomethingLockFile.The previous module-level definitions of LinkFileLock, MkdirFileLock andSQLiteFileLock will be retained until the 1.0 release.To install:    python setup.py install* Documentation: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/pylockfile* Source: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/pylockfile* Bugs: http://bugs.launchpad.net/pylockfile</longdescription>
