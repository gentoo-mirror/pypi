REST/JSON API rather than the previous XML-based API.Note: The US may use an entirely RESTful API as mentioned in [this gist by BenWoodford](https://gist.github.com/BenWoodford/141ca350445e994e69a70aabfb6db942) and [Issue 30](https://github.com/jdhorne/pycarwings2/issues/30)  Please report if this works in the US.  I am based in the UK.Inspired by original pycarwings library: https://github.com/haykinson/pycarwings including code from https://github.com/jdhorne/pycarwings2 and https://github.com/BenWoodford/pycarwings2## Asynchronous methodsNote that several of the most interesting methods in the CARWINGS service areasynchronous--you ask the service to do something, and it just says &quot;ok&quot;. You thenhave to poll a corresponding method to find out if the operation was successful.Recently the polling has continued to return zero, yet when querying the dataheld on the Nissan servers the last update date changes, indicating a responsehas been received from the car, see examples/get-leaf-info.py for how this canbe handled.More details are located at the top of [pycarwings2.py](https://github.com/filcole/pycarwings2/blob/HomeAssistant/pycarwings2/pycarwings2.py).## Installation    pip3 install pycarwings2## Example usage* Copy file ./examples/config.ini to ./examples/my_config.ini* Edit my_config.ini and enter your username, password and region* Run python3 ./examples/get-leaf-info.py## LicenseCopyright 2016 Jason HorneCopyright 2018 Phil ColeLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;);you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.You may obtain a copy of the License athttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, softwaredistributed under the License is distributed on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.See the License for the specific language governing permissions andlimitations under the License.</longdescription>
