	<longdescription># requests-ip-rotatorA Python library to utilize AWS API Gateway's large IP pool as a proxy to generate pseudo-infinite IPs for web scraping and brute forcing.This library will allow the user to bypass IP-based rate-limits for sites and services.X-Forwarded-For headers are automatically randomised and applied unless given. This is because otherwise, AWS will send the client's true IP address in this header.AWS' ApiGateway sends its requests from any available IP - and since the AWS infrastructure is so large, it is almost guarenteed to be different each time. By using ApiGateway as a proxy, we can take advantage of this to send requests from different IPs each time. Please note that these requests can be easily identified and blocked, since they are sent with unique AWS headers (i.e. &quot;X-Amzn-Trace-Id&quot;).---## InstallationThis package is on pypi so you can install via any of the following:  * `pip3 install requests-ip-rotator`* `python3 -m pip install requests-ip-rotator`&amp;nbsp;## Simple Usage```pyimport requestsfrom requests_ip_rotator import ApiGateway# Create gateway object and initialise in AWSgateway = ApiGateway(&quot;https://site.com&quot;)gateway.start()# Assign gateway to sessionsession = requests.Session()session.mount(&quot;https://site.com&quot;, gateway)# Send request (IP will be randomised)response = session.get(&quot;https://site.com/index.php&quot;, params={&quot;theme&quot;: &quot;light&quot;})print(response.status_code)# Delete gatewaysgateway.shutdown()```### Alternate Usage (auto-start and shutdown)```pyimport requestsfrom requests_ip_rotator import ApiGatewaywith ApiGateway(&quot;https://site.com&quot;) as g:    session = requests.Session()    session.mount(&quot;https://site.com&quot;, g)    response = session.get(&quot;https://site.com/index.php&quot;)    print(response.status_code)```Please remember that if gateways are not shutdown via the `shutdown()` method when using method #1, you may be charged in future.&amp;nbsp;## CostsAPI Gateway is free for the first million requests per region, which means that for most use cases this should be completely free.  At the time of writing, AWS charges ~$3 per million requests after the free tier has been exceeded.  If your requests involve data stream, AWS would charge data transfer fee at $0.09 per GB.&amp;nbsp;## Documentation### AWS AuthenticationIt is recommended to setup authentication via environment variables. With [awscli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html), you can run `aws configure` to do this, or alternatively, you can simply set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` variables yourself.You can find your access key ID and secret by following the [official AWS tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html).&amp;nbsp;### Creating ApiGateway objectThe ApiGateway class can be created with the following optional parameters:  | Name              | Description                                          | Required    | Default| -----------       | -----------                                          | ----------- | -----------| site              | The site (without path) requests will be sent to.    | True        || regions           | An array of AWS regions to setup gateways in.        | False       | ip_rotator.DEFAULT_REGIONS| access_key_id     | AWS Access Key ID (will override env variables).     | False       | *Relies on env variables.*| access_key_secret | AWS Access Key Secret (will override env variables). | False       | *Relies on env variables.*| verbose           | Include status and error messages.                   | False       | True```pythonfrom ip_rotator import ApiGateway, EXTRA_REGIONS, ALL_REGIONS# Gateway to outbound HTTP IP and port for only two regionsgateway_1 = ApiGateway(&quot;http://1.1.1.1:8080&quot;, regions=[&quot;eu-west-1&quot;, &quot;eu-west-2&quot;])# Gateway to HTTPS google for the extra regions pack, with specified access key pairgateway_2 = ApiGateway(&quot;https://www.google.com&quot;, regions=EXTRA_REGIONS, access_key_id=&quot;ID&quot;, access_key_secret=&quot;SECRET&quot;)```&amp;nbsp;### Starting API gatewayAn ApiGateway object must then be started using the `start` method.  **By default, if an ApiGateway already exists for the site, it will use the existing endpoint instead of creating a new one.**  This does not require any parameters, but accepts the following:| Name                    | Description                                                           | Required    | Default| -----------             | -----------                                                           | ----------- | -----------| endpoints               | Array of pre-existing endpoints (i.e. from previous session).         | False       || force                   | Create a new set of endpoints, even if some already exist.            | False       | False| require_manual_shutdown | Bool specifying whether Apigateways should persist `shutdown()` calls | False       | False ```python# Starts new ApiGateway instances for site, or locates existing endpoints if they already exist.gateway_1.start()# Starts new ApiGateway instances even if some already exist.gateway_2.start(force=True)```&amp;nbsp;### Sending requestsRequests are sent by attaching the ApiGateway object to a requests Session object.  The site given in `mount` must match the site passed in the `ApiGateway` constructor.  ```pythonimport requests# Posts a request to the site created in gateway_1. Will be sent from a random IP.session_1 = requests.Session()session_1.mount(&quot;http://1.1.1.1:8080&quot;, gateway_1)session_1.post(&quot;http://1.1.1.1:8080/update.php&quot;, headers={&quot;Hello&quot;: &quot;World&quot;})# Send 127.0.0.1 as X-Forwarded-For header in outbound request (otherwise X-Forwarded-For is randomised).session_1.post(&quot;http://1.1.1.1:8080/update.php&quot;, headers={&quot;X-Forwarded-For&quot;, &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;})# Execute Google search query from random IPsession_2 = requests.Session()session_2.mount(&quot;https://www.google.com&quot;, gateway_2)session_2.get(&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=test&quot;)```&amp;nbsp;### Closing ApiGateway ResourcesIt's important to shutdown the ApiGateway resources once you have finished with them, to prevent dangling public endpoints that can cause excess charges to your account.  This is done through the `shutdown` method of the ApiGateway object. It will close all resources for the regions specified in the ApiGateway object constructor.```python# This will shutdown all gateway proxies for &quot;http://1.1.1.1:8080&quot; in &quot;eu-west-1&quot; &amp; &quot;eu-west-2&quot;gateway_1.shutdown()# This will shutdown all gatewy proxies for &quot;https://www.google.com&quot; for all regions in ip_rotator.EXTRA_REGIONSgateway_2.shutdown()```Alternatively, you can selectively shutdown specific endpoints, if needed. To do this, simply pass in an array of endpoints to the shutdown() method, i.e:```python# This will force start a new gateway (i.e. create new endpoints even if some exist on the region already), and then delete the first 3 of them only.gateway_3 = ApiGateway(&quot;http://1.1.1.1:8082&quot;, regions=ALL_REGIONS)endpoints = gateway_3.start(force=True)gateway_3.shutdown(endpoints[:3])```**Please bear in mind that any gateways started with the `require_manual_shutdown` parameter set to `True` will not be deleted via the `shutdown` method, and must be deletedmanually through either the AWS CLI or Website.**## CreditThe core gateway creation and organisation code was adapter from RhinoSecurityLabs' [IPRotate Burp Extension](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/IPRotate_Burp_Extension/).  The X-My-X-Forwarded-For header forwarding concept was originally conceptualised by [ustayready](https://twitter.com/ustayready) in his [fireprox](https://github.com/ustayready/fireprox) proxy.</longdescription>
