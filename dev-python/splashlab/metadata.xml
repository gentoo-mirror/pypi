	<longdescription># SplashLabPython packages intended to assist with experimental research in the field of fluid dynamics. The tools are divided into two categories: computer vision and dimensional analysis. The entire package can be installed with `pip install splashlab`.### Computer VisionThe computer vision module contains several functions and classes that assist mainly with processing image and video data.The first example shows how to use `read_image_folder` to convert all images in a directory to a single numpy array and display the images with `animate_images`:```import splashlab.computer_vision as visionimages = read_image_folder(folder_path, file_extension='.tif', start=0, end=None, step=1, read_color=False)animate_images(images, wait_time=10, wait_key=False, BGR=True, close=True)```### Dimensional Analysis</longdescription>
