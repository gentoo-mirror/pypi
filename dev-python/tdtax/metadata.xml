	<longdescription># Time-domain Astronomy Taxonomy[![Code test](https://github.com/profjsb/timedomain-taxonomy/actions/workflows/test_code.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/profjsb/timedomain-taxonomy/actions/workflows/test_code.yaml)&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/profjsb/timedomain-taxonomy/master/taxonomy-viz.gif&quot;&gt;This project helps us track and version a taxonomy for astronomical time-series sources, for transients (e.g., supernovae and tidal-disruption events), continuous variables (e.g., QSOs) and variable stars (RR Lyrae, &amp;delta;-Scuti). It is open source and we welcome PRs to change/update this taxonomy as need be.The generic structure is human-readable YAML and looks like:```  class: Supernova  comments: |      This is a diverse class of explosions related      to the end-of-life of stars.  links:    - https://astrobites.org/2016/12/02/classifying-supernovae/    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova  tags: [explosive, transient]  other names: [SN, sn, sne, supernova, supernovae]  subclasses:  - class: Type I    tags: [hydrogen poor]    other names: [SN Type I]    subclasses:    - class: Ia      tags: [white dwarf, cosmology, thermonuclear]      other names: [Ia-p, SN Ia, SNIa, supernovae Ia, SNe Ia]      subclasses:      - class: Ia-pec        tags: [peculiar]        other names: [SN Ia-pec, SNIa-pec, Ia-p]     ...```There are two ways to describe the class. Either refer to another YAML file:```- class: Stellar variable    subclasses:      - ref: cataclysmic.yaml      - ref: eclipsing.yaml      - ...```or define the classes outright:```  - class: Novae    tags: [binary]    subclasses:      - class: Classical Nova        other names: []```In this case only the `class` name is required at each level. Other keys (`subclasses`, `comments`, `tags`, `other names`, and `links`) are allowed but not required. The schema is created such that the classification hierarchy is nested: each member of the `subclasses` array is itself a `class`. The idea of `tags` is to allow for a query of different `class` members throughout the taxonomy by a similar observation or physical inference (e.g., a search on `cosmology` could return both `Ia` and `IIP` supernovae). ## InstallationUsing pypi:```pip install -U tdtax```Or Directly from Github:```git clone https://github.com/profjsb/timedomain-taxonomy.gitcd timedomain-taxonomypip install .```## UsageTo get the taxonomy, after installation, as a Python `dict`:```import tdtaxfrom tdtax import taxonomy```This will merge all the YAML taxonomy files referred to in the `top.yaml` file and check to make sure that the taxonomy is validate against the schema.To output the current taxonomy to a webpage that can be interactively traversed:```import tdtaxtdtax.write_viz(tdtax.vega_taxonomy, outname=&quot;viz.html&quot;)```This will write a file `viz.html` which can be viewed in your browser. The `tags` associated with each node is shown upon hover.## ContributingThe taxonomy is captured starting the file `tdtax/top.yaml`. It refers to other YAML files which contain classification hierarchies for subclasses.Upon `import tdtax` the taxonomies are merged into a single JSON tree and this is validated against the schema file `tdtax/schema.json`. Before a PR, test to make sure that taxonomy validates against the schema by running the tests:```pytest```This uses `PyYAML` to validate the taxonomy against the schema. When you make a PR, your branch will be automatically be tested with Travis CI.## LinksTo learn more about taxonomy of variable stars and explosive transients we suggest the following links:   - [&quot;Variable stars&quot; from CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach/education/senior/astrophysics/variable_types.html?newwindow=true)   - [Variability types from GCVS](http://www.sai.msu.su/gcvs/gcvs/vartype.htm?newwindow=true)   - [Supernova classification (astrobites)](https://astrobites.org/2016/12/02/classifying-supernovae/) from A.
