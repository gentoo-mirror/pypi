Mythic is a Command and Control (C2) framework for Red Teaming. The code is on GitHub (https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic) and the Mythic project's documentation is on GitBooks (https://docs.mythic-c2.net).## InstallationYou can install the mythic scripting interface from PyPI:```pip install mythic```## How to useVersion 0.0.13 of the `mythic` package supports version 2.1.* of the Mythic project.Version 0.0.15 of the `mythic` package supports version 2.2.1 of the Mythic project.Version 0.0.20 of the `mythic` package supports version 2.2.6 of the Mythic project (reports as version &quot;3&quot;).Version 0.0.21-25 of the `mythic` package supports version 2.2.8+ of the Mythic project (reports as version &quot;3&quot;).Version 0.0.26 of the `mythic` package supports version 2.3+ of the Mythic project (reports as version &quot;3&quot;).Version 0.0.29-0.0.36 of the `mythic` package supports version 2.3+ of the Mythic project utilizing the new GraphQL endpoints and reports as version &quot;3&quot;.This will be the last version that supports the old mythic_rest interface.
