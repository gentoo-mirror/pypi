It supports the MyST `{eval}` inline role, which facilitates the interweaving of code outputs and prose. For example, we can use inline expressions to explore the properties of a NumPy array.In the code cell:```pythonimport numpy as nparray = np.arange(4)```In the markdown cell:```markdownLet's consider the following array: {eval}`array`.We can compute the total: {eval}`array.sum()` and the maximum value is {eval}`array.max()`.```This will evaluate inline, and show:```textLet's consider the following array: array([0, 1, 2, 3]).We can compute the total: 6 and the maximum value is 3.```You can also use this with `ipywidgets`, and have inline interactive text:![](./images/cookies.gif)Or with `matplotlib` to show inline spark-lines:![](./images/stock-price.gif)You can also edit tasklists directly in the rendered markdown.![](./images/tasklists-in-jupyterlab.gif)## Usage[MyST][myst-quickstart] is a flavour of Markdown, which combines the fluid experience of writing Markdown with the programmable extensibility of reStructuredText. This extension for JupyterLab makes it easier to develop rich, computational narratives, technical documentation, and open scientific communication.### Restore default renderer :notebook:By default, the MyST renderer becomes the default notebook renderer. This means that MyST notebook rendering works out-of-the-box with Jupytext and other notebook-aware extensions. Whilst this extension is in a pre-release state, there is also a &quot;legacy mode&quot; that integrates MyST rendering as an additional `Open With` option that does not replace the default notebook renderer. To enable legacy mode, disable the `jupyterlab-myst:plugin` plugin with:```bashjupyter labextension disable jupyterlab-myst:plugin```### Execution :rocket:To facilitate inline expressions, `jupyterlab-myst` defines a `jupyterlab-myst:executor` plugin. This plugin sends expression code fragments to the active kernel when the user &quot;executes&quot; a Markdown cell. To disable this functionality, disable the `jupyterlab-myst:executor` plugin with:```bashjupyter labextension disable jupyterlab-myst:executor```### Trust :detective:Jupyter Notebooks implement a [trust-based security model](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html). With the addition of inline expressions, Markdown cells are now considered when determining whether a given notebook is &quot;trusted&quot;. Any Markdown cell with inline-expression metadata (with display data) is considered &quot;untrusted&quot;. Like outputs, expression results are rendered using safe renderers if the cell is not considered trusted.Executing the notebook will cause each cell to be considered trusted.To facilitate this extension of the trust model, the `jupyterlab_myst` server extension replaces the `NotebookNotary` from `nbformat` with `MySTNotebookNotary`. This can be disabled with```bashjupyter server extension disable jupyterlab-myst```By disabling this extension, it will not be possible to render unsafe expression results from inline expressions; the `MySTNotebookNotary` adds additional code that makes it possible to mark Markdown cells as trusted.## UninstallTo remove the extension, execute:```bashpip uninstall jupyterlab_myst```## Contributing### Development installNote: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.```bash# Make sure jupyterlab is up to dateconda update jupyterlab# Clone the repo to your local environment# Change directory to the cloned jupyterlab-myst directory# Install package in development modepip install -e .# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLabjupyter labextension develop . --overwrite# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changesjlpm build```You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.```bash# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when neededjlpm watch# Run JupyterLab in another terminaljupyter lab```With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).By default, the `jlpm build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:```bashjupyter lab build --minimize=False```### Development uninstall```bashpip uninstall jupyterlab_myst```In development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`command. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`folder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `jupyterlab-myst` within that folder.### Testing the extension#### Frontend testsThis extension is using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript code testing.To execute them, execute:```shjlpmjlpm test```#### Integration testsThis extension uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) for the integration tests (aka user level tests).More precisely, the JupyterLab helper [Galata](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/galata) is used to handle testing the extension in JupyterLab.More information are provided within the [ui-tests](./ui-tests/README.md) README.### Packaging the extensionSee [RELEASE](RELEASE.md)[myst-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20with-myst-orange[myst-link]: https://myst-tools.org[myst-quickstart]: https://myst-tools.org/docs/mystjs/quickstart-myst-markdown[actions-badge]: https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyterlab-myst/workflows/Build/badge.svg[actions-link]: https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyterlab-myst/actions/workflows/build.yml[binder-badge]: https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg[binder-link]: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/executablebooks/jupyterlab-myst/main?urlpath=lab[pypi-badge]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/jupyterlab-myst.svg[pypi-link]: https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-myst</longdescription>
