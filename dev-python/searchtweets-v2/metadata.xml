This branch was born from the main branch that supportspremium and enterprise tiers of Twitter search. This branch supports the `Twitter API v2 'recent' and 'all' search endpoints &lt;https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/introduction&gt;`__ only, and drops support for the premium and enterprise tiers.This project serves as a wrapper for the all Twitter API v2 search endpoints, including both the endpoints that return Tweets and the endpoints that return *counts* of Tweets. This wrapper provides a command-line utility and a Python library you can integrate into your own scripts.This client library supports these endpoints:- /2/tweets/search/recent- /2/tweets/counts/recent- /2/tweets/search/all- /2/tweets/counts/allThe search endpoint you want to hit is specified in the library's YAML file:.. code:: yaml  search_tweets_v2:    endpoint:  https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent #Or https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/allThe 'recent' search endpoint provides Tweets from the past 7 days. The 'all' search endpoint, launched in January 2021 as part of the 'academic research' tier of Twitter API v2 access, provides access to all publicly avaialble Tweets posted since March 2006.To learn more about the Twitter academic research program, see this [Twitter blog post](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tips/2021/enabling-the-future-of-academic-research-with-the-twitter-api.html).To download and install this package, go to: https://pypi.org/project/searchtweets-v2/If you are looking for the original version that works with premium and enterprise versions of search, head on over tothe main or ``enterprise-premium`` branch. (Soon, the v2 version will be promoted to the main branch.)Features========- Supports Twitter API v2 'recent' and 'all' search.- [Update] Supports the Tweet 'counts' endpoint, which can reduce API call usage and provide rapid insights if you only need Tweet volumes and not Tweet payloads. - Supports the configuration of v2 `expansions &lt;https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/expansions&gt;`_ and `fields &lt;https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/fields&gt;`_.- Supports multiple output formats:   * Original API responses (new default)  * Stream of messages (previous default in versions &lt;1.0.7)  * New 'atomic' format with expansions included in tweets.- Supports a new &quot;polling&quot; mode using the ``since-id`` search request parameter. The ``since-id``, along with the new ``until-id`` provide a way to navigate the public Tweet archive by Tweet ID.- Supports additional ways to specify ``start-time`` and ``end-time`` request parameters:  - #d - For example, '2d' sets ``start-time`` to (exactly) two days ago.  - #h - For example, '12h' sets ``start-time`` to (exactly) twelve hours ago.  - #m - For example, '15m' sets ``start-time`` to (exactly) fifteen minutes ago.  These are handy for kicking off searches with a backfill period, and also work with the ``end-time`` request parameter.These features were inherited from the enterprise/premium version:-  Command-line utility is pipeable to other tools (e.g., ``jq``).-  Automatically handles pagination of search results with specifiable limits.-  Delivers a stream of data to the user for low in-memory requirements.-  Handles OAuth 2 and Bearer Token authentication.-  Flexible usage within a python program.Twitter API v2 search updates====================================Twitter API v2 represents an opportunity to apply previous learnings from building Twitter API v1.1. and the premium and enterprise tiers of endpoints, and redesign and rebuild from the ground up. While building this v2 version of the `search-tweets-python` library,we took the opportunity to update fundamental things. This library provides example scripts, and one example is updating their command-line arguments to better match new v2 conventions. Instead of setting search periods with `start-datetime` and `end-datetime`,they have been shortened to match current search request parameters: `start-time` and `end-time`. Throughout the code, we no longer use parlance that references `rules` and `PowerTrack`, and now reference `queries` and the v2 recent search endpoint.When migrating this Python search client to v2 from the enterprise and premium tiers, the following updates were made:- Added support for GET requests (and removed POST support for now).- Added support for ``since_id`` and ``until_id`` request parameters.- Updated pagination details.- Updated app command-line parlance:      -  --start-datetime → --start-time      -  --end-datetime → --end-time      -  --filter-rule → --query      -  --max-results → --max-tweets      -  --count-bucket → --granularity [Updated 2021-06]       - Dropped --account-type. No longer required since support for Premium and Enterprise search tiers have been dropped.In this spirit of updating the parlance used, note that a core method provided by searchtweets/result_stream.py has been renamed. The method `gen_rule_payload` has been updated to `gen_request_parameters`. **One key update is handling the changes in how the search endpoint returns its data.** The v2 search endpoint returns matching Tweets in a `data` array, along with an `includes` array that provides supporting objects that result from specifying `expansions`.These expanded objects include Users, referenced Tweets, and attached media.  In addition to the `data` and `includes` arrays, the search endpoint also provides a `meta` object that provides the max and min Tweet IDs included in the response,along with a `next_token` if there is another 'page' of data to request.Currently, the v2 client returns the original API responses. Optionally, it can output a stream of Tweet objects with all expansions included in each tweet. Alternatively, it can output a stream of messages, yielding the individual Tweet objects, arrays of User, Tweet, and media objects from the `includes` array, followed by the `meta` object. This matches the behavior of the original search client, and was the default output format in versions 1.0.7 and earlier.Finally, the original version of search-tweets-python used a `Tweet Parser &lt;https://twitterdev.github.io/tweet_parser/&gt;`__ to help manage the differences between two different JSON formats (&quot;original&quot; and &quot;Activity Stream&quot;). With v2, there is just one version of Tweet JSON, so this Tweet Parser is not used.In the original code, this Tweet parser was envoked with a `tweetify=True directive. With this v2 version, this use of the Tweet Parser is turned off by instead using `tweetify=False`.Command-line options====================.. code:: bash  usage: search_tweets.py                         [-h] [--credential-file CREDENTIAL_FILE] [--credential-file-key CREDENTIAL_YAML_KEY] [--env-overwrite ENV_OVERWRITE] [--config-file CONFIG_FILENAME] [--query QUERY]                        [--start-time START_TIME] [--end-time END_TIME] [--since-id SINCE_ID] [--until-id UNTIL_ID] [--results-per-call RESULTS_PER_CALL] [--expansions EXPANSIONS]                        [--tweet-fields TWEET_FIELDS] [--user-fields USER_FIELDS] [--media-fields MEDIA_FIELDS] [--place-fields PLACE_FIELDS] [--poll-fields POLL_FIELDS]                        [--output-format OUTPUT_FORMAT] [--max-tweets MAX_TWEETS] [--max-pages MAX_PAGES] [--results-per-file RESULTS_PER_FILE] [--filename-prefix FILENAME_PREFIX]                        [--no-print-stream] [--print-stream] [--extra-headers EXTRA_HEADERS] [--debug]optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  --credential-file CREDENTIAL_FILE                        Location of the yaml file used to hold your credentials.  --credential-file-key CREDENTIAL_YAML_KEY                        the key in the credential file used for this session's credentials.

Dependencies can be installed with the ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` command.To confirm the your code is ready to go, run the ``$python3 scripts/search-tweets.py -h`` command. You should see the help details shown above.Credential Handling===================The Twitter API v2 search endpoints uses app-only authentication. You have the choice to configure your application consumer key and secret, or a Bearer Token you have generated. If you supply the application key and secret, the client will generate a Bearer Token for you.Many developers might find providing your application key and secret more straightforward and letting this library manage your Bearer Token generation for you. Please see `HERE &lt;https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/oauth-2-0&gt;`_ for an overview of the app-only authentication method.We support both YAML-file based methods and environment variables for storing credentials, and provide flexible handling with sensible defaults.YAML method===========The simplest credential file should look like this:.. code:: yaml  search_tweets_v2:    endpoint:  https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent    consumer_key: &lt;CONSUMER_KEY&gt;    consumer_secret: &lt;CONSUMER_SECRET&gt;    bearer_token: &lt;BEARER_TOKEN&gt;By default, this library expects this file at &quot;~/.twitter_keys.yaml&quot;, but you can pass the relevant location as needed, either with the --credential-file flag for the command-line app or as demonstrated below in a Python program.Both above examples require no special command-line arguments or in-program arguments. The credential parsing methods, unless otherwise specified, will look for a YAML key called search_tweets_v2.For developers who have multiple endpoints and/or search products, you can keep all credentials in the same file and specify specific keys to use. --credential-file-key specifies this behavior in the command line app. An example:.. code:: yaml  search_tweets_v2:    endpoint: https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent    consumer_key: &lt;KEY&gt;    consumer_secret: &lt;SECRET&gt;    (optional) bearer_token: &lt;TOKEN&gt;  search_tweets_labsv2:    endpoint: https://api.twitter.com/labs/2/tweets/search    consumer_key: &lt;KEY&gt;    consumer_secret: &lt;SECRET&gt;    (optional) bearer_token: &lt;TOKEN&gt;Environment Variables=====================If you want or need to pass credentials via environment variables, you can set the appropriate variables:::  export SEARCHTWEETS_ENDPOINT=  export SEARCHTWEETS_BEARER_TOKEN=  export SEARCHTWEETS_CONSUMER_KEY=  export SEARCHTWEETS_CONSUMER_SECRET=The ``load_credentials`` function will attempt to find these variables if it cannot load fields from the YAML file, and it will **overwrite any credentials from the YAML file that are present as environment variables** if they have been parsed. This behavior can be changed by setting the ``load_credentials`` parameter ``env_overwrite`` to ``False``.The following cells demonstrates credential handling in the Python library... code:: python  from searchtweets import load_credentials.. code:: python  load_credentials(filename=&quot;./search_tweets_creds_example.yaml&quot;,                   yaml_key=&quot;search_tweets_v2_example&quot;,                   env_overwrite=False)::  {'bearer_token': '&lt;A_VERY_LONG_MAGIC_STRING&gt;',   'endpoint': 'https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/search/recent',   'extra_headers_dict': None}Environment Variable Overrides------------------------------If we set our environment variables, the program will look for themregardless of a YAML file's validity or existence... code:: python   import os   os.environ[&quot;SEARCHTWEETS_BEARER_TOKEN&quot;] = &quot;&lt;ENV_BEARER_TOKEN&gt;&quot;   os.environ[&quot;SEARCHTWEETS_ENDPOINT&quot;] = &quot;&lt;https://endpoint&gt;&quot;   load_credentials(filename=&quot;nothing_here.yaml&quot;, yaml_key=&quot;no_key_here&quot;)::   cannot read file nothing_here.yaml   Error parsing YAML file; searching for valid environment variables::   {'bearer_token': '&lt;ENV_BEARER_TOKEN&gt;',    'endpoint': '&lt;https://endpoint&gt;'}Command-line app----------------the flags:-  ``--credential-file &lt;FILENAME&gt;``-  ``--credential-file-key &lt;KEY&gt;``-  ``--env-overwrite``are used to control credential behavior from the command-line app.--------------Using the Comand Line Application=================================The library includes an application, ``search_tweets.py``, that provides rapid access to Tweets. When you use ``pip`` to install this package, ``search_tweets.py`` is installed globally. The file is located in the ``scripts/`` directory for those who want to run it locally.Note that the ``--results-per-call`` flag specifies an argument to the API, not as a hard max to number of results returned from this program. The argument ``--max-tweets`` defines the maximum number of results to return from a single run of the ``search-tweets.py``` script. All examples assume that your credentials are set up correctly in the default location - ``.twitter_keys.yaml`` or in environment variables.**Stream json results to stdout without saving**.. code:: bash  search_tweets.py \    --max-tweets 10000 \    --results-per-call 100 \    --query &quot;(snow OR rain) has:media -is:retweet&quot; \    --print-stream**Stream json results to stdout and save to a file**.. code:: bash  search_tweets.py \    --max-tweets 10000 \    --results-per-call 100 \    --query &quot;(snow OR rain) has:media -is:retweet&quot; \    --filename-prefix weather_pics \    --print-stream**Save to file without output**.. code:: bash  search_tweets.py \    --max-tweets 10000 \    --results-per-call 100 \    --query &quot;(snow OR rain) has:media -is:retweet&quot; \    --filename-prefix weather_pics \    --no-print-streamOne or more custom headers can be specified from the command line, using the ``--extra-headers`` argument and a JSON-formatted string representing a dictionary of extra headers:.. code:: bash  search_tweets.py \    --query &quot;(snow OR rain) has:media -is:retweet&quot; \    --extra-headers '{&quot;&lt;MY_HEADER_KEY&gt;&quot;:&quot;&lt;MY_HEADER_VALUE&gt;&quot;}'Options can be passed via a configuration file (either ini or YAML). Example files can be found in the ``config/api_config_example.config`` or ``config/api_yaml_example.yaml`` files, which might look like this:.. code:: bash  [search_rules]  start_time = 2020-05-01  end_time = 2020-05-01  query = (snow OR rain) has:media -is:retweet  [search_params]  results_per_call = 100  max_tweets = 10000  [output_params]  save_file = True  filename_prefix = weather_pics  results_per_file = 10000000Or this:.. code:: bash  search_rules:      start_time: 2020-05-01      end_time: 2020-05-01 01:01      query: (snow OR rain) has:media -is:retweet  search_params:      results_per_call: 100      max_results: 500  output_params:      save_file: True      filename_prefix: (snow OR rain) has:media -is:retweet      results_per_file: 10000000Custom headers can be specified in a config file, under a specific credentials key:.. code:: yaml  search_tweets_v2:    endpoint: &lt;FULL_URL_OF_ENDPOINT&gt;    bearer_token: &lt;AAAAAloooooogString&gt;    extra_headers:      &lt;MY_HEADER_KEY&gt;: &lt;MY_HEADER_VALUE&gt;When using a config file in conjunction with the command-line utility, you need to specify your config file via the ``--config-file`` parameter. Additional command-line arguments will either be added to the config file args or overwrite the config file args if both are specified and present.Example:::  search_tweets.py \    --config-file myapiconfig.config \    --no-print-stream------------------Using the Twitter Search APIs' Python Wrapper=============================================Working with the API within a Python program is straightforward.We'll assume that credentials are in the default location,``~/.twitter_keys.yaml``... code:: python   from searchtweets import ResultStream, gen_request_parameters, load_credentialsTwitter API v2 Setup--------------------.. code:: python   search_args = load_credentials(&quot;~/.twitter_keys.yaml&quot;,                                          yaml_key=&quot;search_tweets_v2&quot;,                                          env_overwrite=False)There is a function that formats search API rules into valid json queries called ``gen_request_parameters``. It has sensible defaults, such as pulling more Tweets per call than the default 10, and not including dates. Discussing the finer points ofgenerating search rules is out of scope for these examples; we encourage you to see the docs to learn the nuances within, but for now let's see what a query looks like... code:: python   query = gen_request_parameters(&quot;snow&quot;, results_per_call=100)    print(query)::   {&quot;query&quot;:&quot;snow&quot;,&quot;max_results&quot;:100}This rule will match tweets that have the text ``snow`` in them.From this point, there are two ways to interact with the API. There is a quick method to collect smaller amounts of Tweets to memory that requires less thought and knowledge, and interaction with the ``ResultStream`` object which will be introduced later.Fast Way--------We'll use the ``search_args`` variable to power the configuration point for the API. The object also takes a valid search query and has options to cutoff search when hitting limits on both number of Tweets and endpoint calls.We'll be using the ``collect_results`` function, which has three parameters.-  query: a valid search query, referenced earlier-  max_results: as the API handles pagination, it will stop collecting   when we get to this number-  result_stream_args: configuration args that we've already specified.Let's see how it goes:.. code:: python   from searchtweets import collect_results.. code:: python   tweets = collect_results(query,                            max_tweets=100,                            result_stream_args=search_args) # change this if you need toAn overwhelming number of Tweet attributes are made available directly, as such:.. code:: python   [print(tweet.text, end='\n\n') for tweet in tweets[0:10]]::   @CleoLoughlin Rain after the snow?

For interactive environments and other cases where you don't care about collecting your data in a single load or don't need to operate on the stream of Tweets directly, I recommend using this convenience function.Working with the ResultStream-----------------------------The ResultStream object will be powered by the ``search_args``, and takes the query and other configuration parameters, including a hard stop on number of pages to limit your API call usage... code:: python   rs = ResultStream(request_parameters=query,                     max_results=500,                     max_pages=1,                     **search_args)   print(rs) ::    ResultStream:    {       &quot;endpoint&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/api.twitter.com\/2\/tweets\/search\/recent&quot;,       &quot;request_parameters&quot;:{           &quot;query&quot;:&quot;snow&quot;,           &quot;max_results&quot;:100       },       &quot;tweetify&quot;:false,       &quot;max_results&quot;:1000   }There is a function, ``.stream``, that seamlessly handles requests and pagination for a given query. It returns a generator, and to grab our 1000 Tweets that mention ``snow`` we can do this:.. code:: python   tweets = list(rs.stream()).. code:: python   # using unidecode to prevent emoji/accents printing    [print(tweet) for tweet in tweets[0:10]]::{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;1270572563505254404&quot;, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;@CleoLoughlin Rain after the snow?

Each request will return up to *30 days* of results, andeach count request can be done on a minutely, hourly, or daily basis.The underlying ``ResultStream`` object will handle converting yourendpoint to the count endpoint, and you have to specify the``count_bucket`` argument when making a rule to use it.The process is very similar to grabbing Tweets, but has some minordifferences... code:: python   count_rule = gen_request_parameters(&quot;snow has:media&quot;, granularity=&quot;day&quot;)   counts = collect_results(count_rule, result_stream_args=enterprise_search_args)Our results are pretty straightforward and can be rapidly used.::{&quot;data&quot;: [{&quot;end&quot;: &quot;2021-05-24T00:00:00.000Z&quot;, &quot;start&quot;: &quot;2021-05-23T00:00:00.000Z&quot;, &quot;tweet_count&quot;:

Make a feature or bugfix branch, e.g.,   ``git checkout -b my_new_feature``2. Make your changes in that branch3. Ensure you bump the version number in ``searchtweets/_version.py`` to   reflect your changes. We use `Semantic   Versioning &lt;https://semver.org&gt;`__, so non-breaking enhancements   should increment the minor version, e.g., ``1.5.0 -&gt; 1.6.0``, and   bugfixes will increment the last version, ``1.6.0 -&gt; 1.6.1``.4. Create a pull requestAfter the pull request process is accepted, package maintainers willhandle building documentation and distribution to Pypi.For reference, distributing to Pypi is accomplished by the followingcommands, ran from the root directory in the repo:.. code:: bash   python setup.py bdist_wheel   python setup.py sdist   twine upload dist/*If you receive an error during the ``twine upload`` step, it may due to the README.rsthaving something invalid in its RST format. Using a RST linter will help fix that.Also, as Pypi updates are made, you may want to clear out previous versions from the package.This can be done with this command: ``rm -rf build dist *.egg-info``How to build the documentation:Building the documentation requires a few Sphinx packages to build thewebpages:.. code:: bash   pip install sphinx   pip install sphinx_bootstrap_theme   pip install sphinxcontrib-napoleonThen (once your changes are committed to master) you should be able torun the documentation-generating bash script and follow theinstructions:.. code:: bash   bash build_sphinx_docs.sh master searchtweetsNote that this README is also generated, and so after any README changesyou'll need to re-build the README (you need pandoc version 2.1+ forthis) and commit the result:.. code:: bash   bash make_readme.sh</longdescription>
