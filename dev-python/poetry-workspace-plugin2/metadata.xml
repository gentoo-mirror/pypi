	<longdescription># Poetry Workspace PluginThis experimental tool is a [Poetry Plugin](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/plugins) to support workflows in a multi-project repository.## InstallationMake sure you are using at least Poetry 1.2.0b3. To install this preview release, run:```shellcurl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/install-poetry.py | python - --preview```Install this plugin:```shellpoetry plugin add poetry-workspace-plugin2```### Why plugin2?The [original package](https://pypi.org/project/poetry-workspace-plugin/) was released by [Martin Liu](https://pypi.org/user/martinxsliu/), a former OpenDoor employee. Before he left, he [re-released the project](https://pypi.org/project/poetry-workspace-plugin2/) under the [OpenDoor PyPI account](https://pypi.org/user/opendoor/).## WorkspaceA workspace is a collection of Poetry projects that share a single environment.## Example config to place at the root```[tool.poetry]name = &quot;code&quot;version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;description = &quot;Opendoor Python workspace&quot;authors = [&quot;Developers &lt;developers@opendoor.com&gt;&quot;][[tool.poetry.source]]name = &quot;pypi-local&quot;url = &quot;https://opendoor.jfrog.io/opendoor/api/pypi/pip/simple&quot;secondary = true[tool.poetry.workspace]include = [  &quot;lib/**&quot;,  &quot;workspace/**&quot;,]exclude = [  &quot;lib/dev-tools&quot;,  &quot;lib/legacy&quot;,  &quot;lib/template/**&quot;,]# IMPORTANT: This pyproject.toml file declares dependencies for the shared Python# workspace. If your app does not belong to the# workspace (i.e. not included in the `include` section above) then do not add your# app dependencies here, it will have no effect. Even if your app does belong to# the workspace, prefer adding app specific dependencies in your app's project. This# section is reserved for workspace level constraints.[tool.poetry.dependencies]python = &quot;~3.9&quot;virtualenv = &quot;^20.10.0&quot;[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]&quot;opendoor.dev-tools&quot; = {path = &quot;lib/dev-tools&quot;, develop = true}&quot;opendoor.tools&quot; = {path = &quot;tools&quot;, develop = true}```</longdescription>
