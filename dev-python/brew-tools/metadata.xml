Prefer to do simplethings in a terminal?Then **brew-tools** is for you.Currently brew-tools includes:-  ABV calculator-  Keg priming calculator-  Priming sugar calculator-  Quick infusion calculator-  Adjust gravity with dme calculator-  Apparent and Real attenuation calculator-  Final gravity from a given attenuation percentage-  Gravity adjustment by boil off/dilution calculator-  New gravity after volume adjustment-  Strike water temperature-  Unit conversionMore to comeSee the `changelog &lt;CHANGELOG.rst&gt;`__ for updates in each versionInstallation============Brew-tools is available from PyPI::    pip install brew-toolsYou can also clone/download this repository and install it using pip::    cd &lt;brew-tools-dir&gt;    pip install .Usage=====When first starting Brew tools you will be asked for your preferred unit type, metric or imperial.This is then stored in a config file and used as the default unit. This can be temporarilychanged with the `--unit` option.Brew tools has built in help::    Usage: brew-tools [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...    Options:    --version  Show the version and exit.    --unit [metric|imperial]  Ignore config and use a different unit.    --help     Show this message and exit.    Commands:    abv    infuse    kegpsi    prime    dmeand also for its commands::    brew-tools infuse --help    Usage: brew-tools infuse [OPTIONS]    Options:      -temp FLOAT    Current temperature of mash      -target FLOAT  Target temperature of mash      -ratio FLOAT   Grist/water ratio      -grain FLOAT   Weight of grain in mash      -water FLOAT   Temp of infusion water      --help         Show this message and exit.If the inputs are not passed via the command line arguments, brew toolswill prompt the user for input.For more information see the`documentation &lt;https://brew-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`__Development===========If you want to help develop brew tools you should install it into avirtual environment. The current version of brew-tools uses [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/)to manage virtual environments and such.In order to start, [install Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/#installation)and change into the brew-tools directory. From there you can run::    poetry installwhich will create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.To run `brew_tools` in the developmeent environment it's probably easiest to run::    poetry shellwhich will spawn a configured shell for the environment.Tests can be run in this environment, or you can use::   poetry run pytest teststo run the tests without spawning a shell.In addition to the tests it's advisable to run a linter of the source as Traviswill also check for linting errors. The linter command ignores some errors, so youcan use this command to match the command run by Travis::    poetry run flake8 src --ignore=E501,W504,W503Thanks======Thanks to-  /u/DAMNIT\_REZNO - for inspiring me to start this project-  SlayterDev - DME addition calculator-  Szczyp - Add input for grain temp and fix missing input functionLicense=======Brew Tools is released under the MIT license.See ``LICENSE.txt`` for more details.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.com/Svenito/brew-tools.svg?branch=main   :target: https://travis-ci.com/Svenito/brew-tools.. |Documentation Status| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/brew-tools/badge/?version=latest   :target: https://brew-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest.. |PyPI version| image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/brew-tools.svg   :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/brew-tools</longdescription>
