	<longdescription># bbbmonA small python based CLI utility to monitor BigBlueButton-Usage. ## InstallationThe easiest way to install bbbmon is to install it from the Python Package Index (PyPi). This project uses [python poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management, so you could also run it without installing the package system wide, see instructions below.## Install with pip3```bashsudo pip3 install bbbmon --upgrade```Then run with:```bashbbbmon```## Run with poetry (without pip)Clone the repo:```bashgit clone https://code.hfbk.net/bbb/bbbmon.git```Make sure you have poetry installed. Install instruction for poetry can be [found here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).From inside the project directory run:```bashpoetry install```Run bbbmon with:```bashpoetry run bbbmon```# ConfigurationRun `bbbmon config --new` to create a new default configuration file. bbbmon will always ask you before it creates or overwrites anything.Within the config you can define one or more endpoints with running bbb instances – each with it's secret and bigbluebutton-URL. You can find the secret on your server in it's config-file via ```bashcat /usr/share/bbb-web/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties | grep securitySalt=```A example configuration file could look like this:```toml[bbb.example.com]securitySalt=MY_SUPER_SECRET_SECRETbigbluebutton.web.serverURL=https://bbb.example.com/[Föö]securitySalt=MY_SUPER_SECRET_SECRET2bigbluebutton.web.serverURL=https://bbb.foo.com/```The section names in the square brackets can be chosen arbitrarily (as long as they are unique) and will be used as display names (they support utf-8). It makes sense to keep them short as they can be  used for filtering and/or ordering:```bashbbbmon meetings -e Föö```# UsageFor help run:```bashbbbmon -h```bbbmon supports command abbreviations – these commands produce the same result:```bashbbbmon meetingsbbbmon meetingbbbmon meebbbmon m```This works as long as there is no other command starting with the same letters.</longdescription>
