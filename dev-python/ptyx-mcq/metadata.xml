	<longdescription>pTyX MCQ Extension==================MCQ generation (PDF files) and automatic marking of scanned students answers.Overview--------pTyX is a LaTeX precompiler, written in Python.pTyX enables to generate LaTeX documents, using custom commands or plain python code.One single pTyX file may generate many latex documents, with different values.I developed and used pTyX to make several versions of a same test in exams,for my student, to discourage cheating.Since it uses sympy library, pTyX has symbolic calculus abilities too.The `pTyX MCQ extension` makes it easy to use pTyX to generate Multiple Choice Questions in the form of pdf documents.The students MCQ can then be scanned and automatically corrected and marked.Installation------------Obviously, pTyX needs a working Python installation.Python version 3.8 (at least) is required for pTyX MCQ to run.Currently, pTyX is only supported on GNU/Linux.The easiest way to install it is to use pip.    $ pip install --user ptyx_mcqUsage-----To generate a template, run:    $ mcq new new_folderThis will generate a `new_folder` folder with a `new.ptyx` file inside,which is the main configuration file.This will also create a `new_folder/questions/` folder, where you should put all the exercises, as `.txt` files. A few text files are already included as examples.See the next section (*MCQ file format*) for more information about those files format.To compile the template, run:    $ mcq makeFor more options:    $ mcq make --helpTo automatically corrected the scanned students MCQs, but them as a pdf inside `new_folder/scan`.Then run:        $ mcq scanMCQ file format---------------When running `mcq new`, a template folder will be generated, including a `new.ptyx` file.(More to come...)</longdescription>
