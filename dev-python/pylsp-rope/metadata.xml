	<longdescription># pylsp-rope[![Tests](https://github.com/python-rope/pylsp-rope/actions/workflows/run-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/python-rope/pylsp-rope/actions/workflows/run-test.yml)Extended refactoring capabilities for Python LSP Server using[Rope](https://github.com/python-rope/rope).This is a plugin for [Python LSPServer](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server), so you also need tohave it installed.python-lsp-server already has basic built-in support for using Rope, but it'scurrently limited to just renaming and completion. Installing this plugin addsmore refactoring functionality to python-lsp-server.## InstallationTo use this plugin, you need to install this plugin in the same virtualenv aspython-lsp-server itself.``` bashpip install pylsp-rope```Then run `pylsp` as usual, the plugin will be auto-discovered bypython-lsp-server if you've installed it to the right environment. On Vim,refer to [Rope in Vim orNeovim](https://github.com/python-rope/rope/wiki/Rope-in-Vim-or-Neovim). Forother editors, refer to your IDE/text editor's documentation on how to setup alanguage server. ## ConfigurationThere is no configuration yet.## FeaturesThis plugin adds the following features to python-lsp-server:- extract method (codeAction)- extract variable (codeAction)- inline method/variable/parameter (codeAction)- use function (codeAction)- method to method object (codeAction)- convert local variable to field (codeAction)- organize imports (codeAction)- introduce parameter (codeAction)- generate variable/function/class from undefined variable (codeAction)- more to come...Refer to [Rope documentation](https://github.com/python-rope/rope/blob/master/docs/overview.rst)for more details on how these refactoring works.## Usage### Extract methodVariants: - Extract method- Extract global method- Extract method including similar statements- Extract global method including similar statementsWhen CodeAction is triggered and the cursor is on any block of code, extractthat expression into a method. Optionally, similar statements can also beextracted.### Extract variableVariants: - Extract variable- Extract global variable- Extract variable including similar statements- Extract global variable including similar statementsWhen CodeAction is triggered and the cursor is on a expression, extract thatexpression into a variable. Optionally, similar statements can also beextracted.### InlineWhen CodeAction is triggered and the cursor is on a resolvable Python variable,replace all calls to that method with the method body.### Use functionWhen CodeAction is triggered and the cursor is on the function name of a `def`statement, try to replace code whose AST matches the selected function with acall to the function.### Method to method objectWhen CodeAction is triggered and the cursor is on the function name of a `def`statement, create a callable class to replace that method. You may want toinline the method afterwards to remove the indirection.### Convert local variable to fieldWhen CodeAction is triggered wand the cursor is on a local variable inside amethod, convert that local variable to an attribute.### Organize importTrigger CodeAction anywhere in a Python file to organize imports.### Introduce parameterWhen CodeAction is triggered and the cursor is selecting a Python variable orattribute, make that variable/attribute a parameter.### Generate codeVariants:- [x] Generate variable- [x] Generate function- [x] Generate class- [ ] Generate module- [ ] Generate packageWhen CodeAction is triggered and the cursor is on an undefined Pythonvariable, generate an empty variable/function/class/module/package for thatname.## CaveatSupport for working on unsaved document is currently experimental.This plugin is in early development, so expect some bugs. Please report in[Github issue tracker](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server/issues)if you had any issues with the plugin.## DevelopingSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/python-rope/pylsp-rope/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).## CreditsThis package was created with[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) from[lieryan/cookiecutter-pylsp-plugin](https://github.com/lieryan/cookiecutter-pylsp-plugin)project template.</longdescription>
