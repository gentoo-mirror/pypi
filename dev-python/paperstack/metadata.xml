There, the left panel lists the records in your library (use arrow keys to navigate) and the right panel shows record details. Below, the footer displays key map hints and other messages.&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamroque/Paperstack/main/assets/screenshot_1.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;There is also a command-line interface, which can be useful for batch actions and integration with other programs. For example, run the command```shpaperstack add article 'author: Albert Einstein; title: Die Grundlage der allgemeinen Relativit√§tstheorie; journal: AdP; year: 1916'```to add a new paper. Note the syntax for entries (`key1: value1; key2: value2`). Then run```shpaperstack list```to list all added records in the library. A slightly less trivial use case might be to scrape multiple articles at once. The following script reads a list of bibcodes from a text file and uses Paperstack to add them to your library.```shfor line in $(cat bibcodes.txt); do    paperstack scrape ads &quot;bibcode: $line&quot; --adddone```Configuration for Paperstack goes in `$HOME/.paperstack.cfg`. The config file follows a standard similar to Windows `.ini` files. Sections are labeled with `[section name]` and settings are written as `key = value`. Check the documentation for the different settings you can customize. Below is an example configuration.```ini[paths]data = ~/Documents/Paperstack/[article]id-format = author@2-title@15-year@4[ads]key = &lt;YOUR-API-KEY&gt;timeout = 10[arxiv]timeout = 10[keys]vim-bindings = yes[editor]command = vimextension = md```Note that to scrape ADS, a valid API key has to be specified in the config file.Find a presentation containing a few use cases and general information [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamroque/Paperstack/main/assets/Paperstack.pdf).### ExportingPaperstack supports exporting to both BibTeX and a variety of citation standards. In order to maintain a small installation size, however, only the Harvard citation style is enabled by default. To add more, visit [CSL Styles | GitHub](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles) and download the `.csl` file corresponding to your preferred style. Then, save that file to the `csl` directory within the data directory specified in your configuration.A few common styles you can download include:* &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa-6th-edition.csl&quot; download&gt;APA 6 | GitHub&lt;/a&gt;* &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/modern-language-association.csl&quot; download&gt;MLA | GitHub&lt;/a&gt;* &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/chicago-author-date.csl&quot; download&gt;Chicago | GitHub&lt;/a&gt;## ContributingAll contributions are welcome. Reporting issues on the GitHub repository is greatly appreciated, but pull requests are preferred. In particular, help is needed to:- Improve documentation;- Test on different platforms;- Add support for new databases;- Add support for new record types (books, websites, etc.);- Any other goals or roadmap items listed in the [Project Notes](./notes.org).Note that contributions should follow PEP 8 as closely as possible (though not strictly enforced), docstrings should follow the [Numpy format](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html), and that, in general, simple, flat, and scalable code is strongly encouraged.A special thanks to [Dr. Mosenkov](https://physics.byu.edu/department/directory/mosenkov) for conceiving and co-creating this project.## LicenseThis program is licensed under the GNU General Public License.</longdescription>
