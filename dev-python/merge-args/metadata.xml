	<longdescription>====================================================================merge_args — merge signatures of two functions with Advanced Hackery====================================================================.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/Kwpolska/merge_args.svg?branch=master   :target: https://travis-ci.org/Kwpolska/merge_argsThis small library uses Advanced Python Hackery to change the signature of afunction to be a mixture of itself and a function that it wraps. It’s like``functools.wraps``, but it allows the wrapped function to add its ownarguments into the mix.Usage-----.. code:: python    from merge_args import merge_args    def old(foo, bar):        &quot;&quot;&quot;This is old's docstring.&quot;&quot;&quot;        print(foo, bar)        return foo + bar    @merge_args(old)    def new(prefix, foo, *args, **kwargs):        return old(prefix + foo, *args, **kwargs)If you then run ``help(new)``, this is the output:.. code:: text    Help on function new in module __main__:    new(prefix, foo, bar)        This is old's docstring.How it works?-------------I wrote a detailed blog post, describing the ins and outs of how this package works:https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/09/20/python-hackery-merging-signatures-of-two-python-functions/This module was inspired by F4D3C0D3 on #python (formerly on freenode IRC).License-------Copyright © 2018-2022, Chris Warrick.All rights reserved.Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or withoutmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions aremet:1.
