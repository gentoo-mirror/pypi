	<longdescription>My.Jdownloader-API-Python-Library=================================My.Jdownloader API Python LibraryThis a module for Python 3 to interact with My.Jdownloader. This is in aWIP project.You're free to use it following the MIT license and anycollaboration is appreciated.To use this API you need to use a &quot;APPkey&quot;.This APPkey can be anythingyou want but it's recommended to be something that identifies yourproject or a URL to it. Right now this module uses &quot;http://git.io/vmcsk&quot;as the APPKey, but this APPKey is intended just for testing and forlittle projects, it's recommended that you uses your own &quot;APPKey&quot; so iffor some reason this APPKey gets blocked you don't get affected.Right now the only things working are: - JD: -Connect,Disconnect,Reconnect,GetDevices,listDevices - JD.Device: -action,addLinksExample of usage:::    import myjdapi    jd=myjdapi.myjdapi()    jd.connect(&quot;example@example.com&quot;,&quot;password&quot;)    jd.getDevices()    jd.getDevice(name=&quot;DeviceName&quot;).linkgrabber.addLinks([{&quot;autostart&quot; : False, &quot;links&quot; : &quot;https://mega.nz/#!xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,http://mediafire.com/download/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/&quot;,&quot;packageName&quot; : TEST&quot; }])DOCUMENTATION=============http://myjdownloader-api-python-library.readthedocs.org/en/latest/myjdapi.html#module-myjdapiLICENSE=======The MIT License (MIT)Copyright (c) 2015 Marc Marquez SantamariaPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining acopy of this software and associated documentation files (the&quot;Software&quot;), to deal in the Software without restriction, includingwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and topermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject tothe following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be includedin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESSOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OFMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANYCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.</longdescription>
