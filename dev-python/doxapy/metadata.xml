	<longdescription># DoxaPy## IntroductionDoxaPy is an image binarization library focussing on local adaptive thresholding algorithms. In English, this means that it has the ability to turn a color or gray scale image into a black and white image.**Algorithms*** Otsu - &quot;A threshold selection method from gray-level histograms&quot;, 1979.* Bernsen - &quot;Dynamic thresholding of gray-level images&quot;, 1986.* Niblack - &quot;An Introduction to Digital Image Processing&quot;, 1986.* Sauvola - &quot;Adaptive document image binarization&quot;, 1999.* Wolf - &quot;Extraction and Recognition of Artificial Text in Multimedia Documents&quot;, 2003.* Gatos - &quot;Adaptive degraded document image binarization&quot;, 2005.

Unless you are constantly changing algorithm parameters for the same image, it is recommended that you call this method.```python# Transforms the grayscale image buffer into binary with a single calldoxapy.Binarization.update_to_binary(doxapy.Binarization.Algorithms.NICK, grayscale_image)```## Building with Pybind11Release Build - Requires: NumPy, Pybind11```clone https://github.com/brandonmpetty/Doxacd Doxa/Bindings/Pythonpython copy-cpp-files.pypython setup.py install```## LicenseCC0 - Brandon M.
