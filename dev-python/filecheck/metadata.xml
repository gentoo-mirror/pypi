	<longdescription># FileCheck.pyAttempt to reimplement LLVM's FileCheck using Python.![](https://github.com/mull-project/FileCheck.py/workflows/FileCheck.py%20on%20macOS/badge.svg)![](https://github.com/mull-project/FileCheck.py/workflows/FileCheck.py%20on%20Linux/badge.svg)![](https://github.com/mull-project/FileCheck.py/workflows/FileCheck.py%20on%20Windows/badge.svg)## BackgroundMany software projects could benefit from a suite of LLVM LIT integration tests.The problem is that you have to build `FileCheck` from LLVM sourceswhich is not a trivial task for 1) people who are not familiar with the LLVMinfrastructure and 2) Python-based projects that would prefer to not haveto build anything from LLVM's source code in their CI process.The option of having pre-compiled binaries is a workaround, but we don't like tokeep third-party binary artifacts in source code.## DocumentationDocumentation is hosted on Read the Docs:[FileCheck.py documentation](https://filecheck.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)## CopyrightCopyright (c) 2019-2023 Stanislav Pankevich s.pankevich@gmail.com.
