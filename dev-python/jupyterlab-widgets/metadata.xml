	<longdescription># Jupyter Widgets JupyterLab ExtensionA JupyterLab 3.0 extension for Jupyter/IPython widgets.## InstallationTo enable ipywidgets support in JupyterLab 3.x:```bashpip install jupyterlab_widgets```### Version compatibilityPrior to JupyterLab 3.0, use the appropriate command from the following listto install a compatible JupyterLab extension.- For JupyterLab 0.30, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.31`- For JupyterLab 0.31rc1, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.32`- For JupyterLab 0.31rc2, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.33`- For JupyterLab 0.31.x, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.34`- For JupyterLab 0.32.x, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.35`- For JupyterLab 0.33.x, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.36`- For JupyterLab 0.34.x, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.37`- For JupyterLab 0.35.x, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.38`- For JupyterLab 1.0.x and 1.1.x, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@1.0`- For JupyterLab 1.2.x, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@1.1`- For JupyterLab 2.x, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@2`## Contributing### Development installNote: You will need Node.js to build the extension package.The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.```bash# Clone the repo to your local environment# Change directory to the jupyterlab_widgets directory# Install package in development modepip install -e .# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLabjupyter labextension develop . --overwrite# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changesjlpm build```You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.```bash# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when neededjlpm watch# Run JupyterLab in another terminaljupyter lab```With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).### Uninstall```bashpip uninstall jupyterlab_widgets```</longdescription>
