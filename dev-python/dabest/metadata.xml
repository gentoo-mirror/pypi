	<longdescription>Estimation statistics is a simple framework &lt;https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/&gt;that—while avoiding the pitfalls of significance testing—uses familiar statisticalconcepts: means, mean differences, and error bars. More importantly, it focuses onthe effect size of one's experiment/intervention, as opposed tosignificance testing.An estimation plot has two key features. Firstly, it presents alldatapoints as a swarmplot, which orders each point to display theunderlying distribution. Secondly, an estimation plot presents theeffect size as a bootstrap 95% confidence interval on a separate butaligned axes.Please cite this work as:Moving beyond P values: Everyday data analysis with estimation plotsJoses Ho, Tayfun Tumkaya, Sameer Aryal, Hyungwon Choi, Adam Claridge-Changhttps://doi.org/10.1101/377978</longdescription>
