	<longdescription># Prostate NomogramsA simple implementation of prostate cancer nomograms.&gt; Prostate cancer nomograms are prediction tools designed to help patients and their physicians understand the nature of their prostate cancer, assess risk based on specific characteristics of a patient and his disease, and predict the likely outcomes of treatment. &lt;sup&gt;[1][1]&lt;/sup&gt;## Installation### Latest stable version :```pip install prostate-nomograms```### Latest (possibly unstable) version :```pip install git+https://github.com/MaxenceLarose/prostate-cancer-nomograms```## Quick usage preview```pythonimport pandas as pdfrom prostate_nomograms import MskccPreRadicalProstatectomyNomogram, ClassificationOutcomemskcc_nomogram = MskccPreRadicalProstatectomyNomogram(outcome=ClassificationOutcome.LYMPH_NODE_INVOLVEMENT)dataframe = pd.read_csv(&quot;data.csv&quot;)probability = mskcc_nomogram.predict_proba(dataframe)```## MotivationNomograms are typically implemented as web-based applications in which a physician must fill in certain boxes using a patient's medical information. Once all the boxes are filled in, the prediction tool can either calculate the probability of several clinical outcomes or calculate a risk score associated with the patient's health status, depending on the type of nomogram. The **purpose** of this application is to speed up the process for a very large number of patients. Indeed, the statistical models of the nomograms are reproduced in Python which allows to calculate in a few seconds the probabilities and the scores of thousands of patients. The coefficients of the models are read from the web sites, then used for the calculations.## Which nomograms are currently implemented?Currently, the nomograms of two major centers are implemented, namely :1. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)   - [Pre-Radical Prostatectomy](https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate/pre_op)2. UCSF - CAPRA   - [CAPRA Score](https://urology.ucsf.edu/research/cancer/prostate-cancer-risk-assessment-and-the-ucsf-capra-score#.YS1Kqo5KiUk)The MSKCC nomogram directly gives the probability and risk of different outcomes. The UCSF one gives a CAPRA score, which is then converted to probability using logistic regression or cox regression on patient data.Note that a custom nomogram is also implemented, i.e. a simple logistic regression or cox regression using arbitrary variables. ## Getting startedYou can find examples [here](https://github.com/MaxenceLarose/ProstateCancerNomograms/tree/main/examples).## LicenseThis code is provided under the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/MaxenceLarose/delia/blob/main/LICENSE).## Citation```@misc{prostate-nomograms,  title={prostate-nomograms: Prediction tools based on existing prostate cancer nomograms},  author={Maxence Larose},  year={2022},  publisher={Universit√© Laval},  url={https://github.com/MaxenceLarose/prostate-nomograms},}```## ContactMaxence Larose, B.
