	<longdescription># Microsoft Azure SDK for PythonThis is the Microsoft Azure Iotcentral Management Client Library.This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.For a more complete view of Azure libraries, see the [azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).# UsageTo learn how to use this package, see the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)For docs and references, see [Python SDK References](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/)Code samples for this package can be found at [Iotcentral Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&amp;term=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing&amp;terms=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing) on docs.microsoft.com.Additional code samples for different Azure services are available at [Samples Repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)# Provide FeedbackIf you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the[Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)section of the project. ![Impressions](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2Fazure-mgmt-iotcentral%2FREADME.png)# Release History## 9.0.0 (2021-11-11)**Features**  - Model App has a new parameter state  - Model App has a new parameter identity  - Model AppPatch has a new parameter state  - Model AppPatch has a new parameter identity## 9.0.0b1 (2021-05-13)This is beta preview version.This version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).**General breaking changes**- Credential system has been completly revamped:  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user  - For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)**General new features**- Type annotations support using `typing`. SDKs are mypy ready.- This client has now stable and official support for async. Check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.- This client now support natively tracing library like OpenCensus or OpenTelemetry. See this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.## 4.1.0 (2021-02-19)**Features**  - Model AppTemplate has a new parameter industry  - Model AppTemplate has a new parameter locations  - Model Operation has a new parameter properties  - Model Operation has a new parameter origin## 4.0.0 (2021-01-05)**Features**  - Model AppTemplate has a new parameter name**Breaking changes**  - Model AppTemplate no longer has parameter app_template_name## 3.1.0 (2020-06-30)**Features**  - Model AppPatch has a new parameter sku## 3.0.0 (2020-03-09)**Breaking changes**- Removed operation AppsOperations.list_templates## 2.0.0 (2019-12-25)**Features**  - Added operation AppsOperations.list_templates**General Breaking Changes**This version uses a next-generation code generator that might introducebreaking changes if from some import. In summary, some modules wereincorrectly visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed severalissues caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used inthe first place. IoTCentralClient cannot be imported fromazure.mgmt.iotcentreal.iot_central_client anymore (import fromazure.mgmt.iotcentreal works like before) IoTCentralClientConfigurationimport has been moved from azure.mgmt.iotcentreal.iot_central_clientto azure.mgmt.iotcentreal A model MyClass from a &quot;models&quot; sub-modulecannot be imported anymore using azure.mgmt.iotcentreal.models.my_class(import from azure.mgmt.iotcentreal.models works like before) Anoperation class MyClassOperations from an operations sub-module cannotbe imported anymore usingazure.mgmt.iotcentreal.operations.my_class_operations (import fromazure.mgmt.iotcentreal.operations works like before) Last but not least,HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default. You should always usea client as a context manager, or call close(), or use no more than oneclient per process.## 1.0.0 (2018-10-26)**Features**  - Model OperationInputs has a new parameter type  - Model ErrorDetails has a new parameter details  - Added operation AppsOperations.check_subdomain_availability**Breaking changes**  - Operation AppsOperations.check_name_availability has a new    signature**Note**  - azure-mgmt-nspkg is not installed anymore on Python 3 (PEP420-based    namespace package)## 0.2.0 (2018-08-07)  - Replace API version by 2018-09-01## 0.1.0 (2018-07-16)  - Initial Release with support for 2017-07-01-privatepreview</longdescription>
