	<longdescription>Welcome=======**wolfSSL Python**, a.k.a. ``wolfssl`` is a Python modulethat encapsulates `wolfSSL's SSL/TLS library&lt;https://wolfssl.com/wolfSSL/Products-wolfssl.html&gt;`_.The **wolfSSL SSL/TLS library** is a lightweight, portable, C-language-basedlibrary targeted at IoT, embedded, and RTOS environments primarily because ofits size, speed, and feature set. It works seamlessly in desktop, enterprise,and cloud environments as well.Prerequisites=============Linux-----During installation via pip this will download the wolfSSL source and compile it, it therefore needs the same prerequisites as the wolfSSL C library. Therefore in Debian / Ubuntu you should do:.. code-block:: bash   $ sudo apt install build-essential   $ sudo apt build-dep libwolfssl-devCompiling=========The `setup.py` file covers most things you will need to do to build and install from source. As pre-requisites you will need to install either from your OS repository or pip. You'll also need the Python development package for your Python version:* `cffi`* `tox`* `pytest`To build a source package run `python setup.py sdist`, to build a wheel package run `python setup.py bdist_wheel`. To test the build run `tox`. The `tox` tests rely on Python 3.9 being installed, if you do not have this version we recommend using `pyenv` to install it.Installation============We provide Python wheels (prebuilt binaries) for OSX 64 bits and Linux 64 bits:.. code-block:: bash    $ pip install wheel    $ pip install wolfsslTo build wolfssl-py from source:.. code-block:: bash    $ cd wolfssl-py    $ pip install .The default pip install clones wolfSSL from GitHub. To build wolfssl-py using alocal installation of the native wolfSSL C library, the USE_LOCAL_WOLFSSLenvironment variable should be set.  USE_LOCAL_WOLFSSL can be set to &quot;1&quot; to usethe default library installation location (/usr/local/lib, /usr/local/include),or to use a custom location it can be set to the install location of your nativewolfSSL library.  For example:.. code-block:: bash    # Uses default install location    $ USE_LOCAL_WOLFSSL=1 pip install .    # Uses custom install location    $ USE_LOCAL_WOLFSSL=/tmp/install pip install .Testing=======To run the tox tests in the source code, you'll need ``tox`` and a few otherrequirements.1. Make sure that the testing requirements are installed:.. code-block:: shell    sudo -H pip install -r requirements/test.txt2. Run ``make check``:.. code-block:: console    $ make check    ...    _________________________________ summary _________________________________    py3: commands succeeded    congratulations :)Support=======For support and questions, please email support@wolfssl.com.</longdescription>
