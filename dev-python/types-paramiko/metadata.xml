All fixes fortypes and metadata should be contributed there.This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.This package was generated from typeshed commit `d27426488ed48fd54290db765702685ca596c0c5` and was testedwith mypy 1.7.1, pyright 1.1.334, andpytype 2023.11.21.</longdescription>
