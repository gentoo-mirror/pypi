It can be used on Windows and Linux x64 platforms.#### Quicklaunch for Applications in Conan Packages# &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goszpeti/conan_app_launcher/v2.0.0/doc/screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;512&quot;&gt;#### Local Package Manager# &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goszpeti/conan_app_launcher/v2.0.0/doc/screenshot_pkg_explorer.png&quot; width=&quot;512&quot;&gt;#### Conan Search# &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goszpeti/conan_app_launcher/v2.0.0/doc/screenshot_conan_search.png&quot; width=&quot;512&quot;&gt;#### Conan Config# &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goszpeti/conan_app_launcher/v2.0.0/doc/screenshot_conan_conf.png&quot; width=&quot;512&quot;&gt;**Main Features**- compatible with a wide range of conan versions (from 1.24 onwards)- integrated console for information an packages and config file- installable with pipQuicklaunch- configurable layout (tabs and applications) in the GUI- list and grid view- can also open files with their associated default program- installs all referenced packages automatically- automatic conan settings resolution for your platform- uses the default icons of files or can be configured to use custom ones- quick controls to switch between versions and channelsLocal Package Explorer- view for browsing through installed packages- understand package settings at a glance from a shortened representation, e.g. Linux_x64_ggc7- supports copy/paste on file, open in file explorer, copy reference, etc. functions which are often needed in daily Conan workflowConan Search- search for references in selected remotes- show all existing packages for a reference and their infos- install package directly via right-click menuConan Config- view and edit your profiles- view and edit your remotes - with multilogin to the same arifactory server for multiple remotes- see the most important paths and config at one glancePlugin Mechanism- All views are now plugins, which can be extended by the user## How to install?### Prerequisites on LinuxCurrently testing and compatibility is only endured for Debian based distros, specifically Ubuntu 20.04.1. Pip must be updated to at least pip 20.3, so using a venv like this is recommended:    sudo apt install python3-venv    python3 -m venv .venv     source .venv/bin/activate    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip    pip install conan_app_launcher2. An x-terminal emulator must be available for &quot;Open Files in cmd&quot; and console based programs for the App Grid. Type &quot;x-terminal-emulator&quot; to get a list of available terminals.3. To open files with its associated program xdg-open is used:    sudo apt install xdg-utils### With pip from PyPi`pip install conan-app-launcher`### From sourceAfter checkout use the command:`pip install .`## RunningExecute `conan-app-launcher`, if the Python &quot;scripts&quot; folder is on your system path, or look it up manually in the site-packages folder. You can also assign its icon to it from the site packages folder in conan_app_launcher/assets/icons/icon.ico.### Main dependencies* Pyside6 &gt;= 6.4.0* conan &gt;= 1.24.0&gt; **Warning** - **Deprecation of Python 3.6**  &gt; From version 2.0.0 Python 3.6 will not be supported anymore, because end-of-life support has been reached.## ToolchainThis project uses Python with Qt as a frontend using the PySide6 integration.An IDE configuration is available for VsCode.See https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=goszpeti_conan_app_launcher for Static Code Analysis.## Licenses of used libraries and code&gt; **Warning** - **Change of License to LGPL**&gt; From version 2.0.0 the project will use the [LGPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html) license to cleanly comply with PySide6.#### Resources* Conan Package Manager Icon by Conan.io developers under [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php), via Wikimedia Commons* [Noto Sans and Noto Sans Mono fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) by Google under [SIL Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=OFL)* [Material icons](https://fonts.google.com/) by Google  under [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)* [Linux icon](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/340563/linux-alt) by Carbon Design  under [Apache License](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-1.1)* [Apple icon](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/488495/apple) by Klever Space  under [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)* [Windows icon](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/488736/windows) by Klever Space under [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)* Modified [Package icon](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/487645/package) by Neuicons [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)* Modified [Open Box icon](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/383786/open-box-parcel) by wishforge.gamesunder [CC Attribution License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)&lt;/li&gt;##### PyPi runtime dependencies* PySide6 by Qt, [LGPL V3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html)* Conan by JFrog LTD under [MIT License](&lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php&gt;)* jsonschema by Julian Berman under [MIT License](&lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php&gt;)* Using a modified version of Toggle Widget from QtWidgets (https://github.com/pythonguis/python-qtwidgets) under [MIT License](&lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php&gt;)##### PyPi backports for older Python versions* importlib-metadata by Jason R.
