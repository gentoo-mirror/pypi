Note its still in beta  YouDotCom's YouChat feature is a powerful tool that allows for context to be utilized in your conversations. By passing a list or a file in the JSON format, you can provide the chatbot with additional information to better understand and respond to your questions.To use the context option, you can change the way you send your message by changing the `Chat.send_message` method. This method allows you to pass in a driver, a message, and a context_form_file or a context parameter.For example, if you want to use a file, you can pass the file name as the `context_form_file` parameter, like this:  ```pythonChat.send_message(driver=driver, message=&quot;YOUR QUESTION HERE&quot;, context_form_file=&quot;FILE_NAME.json&quot;)```  Make sure to change the `FILE_NAME` to the name of the file you are using and include a question in the `message` parameter.Alternatively, you can also use the context directly without a file by passing in a list as the `context` parameter. Like this:  ```pythonChat.send_message(driver=driver, message=&quot;YOUR QUESTION HERE&quot;, context=['context #1', '#2', 'etc...'])```By providing context to your conversations, you can expect more accurate and personalized responses from YouChat, which can help to improve your overall experience.The following is an example of a JSON file that can be used as the `context_form_file` parameter in the `Chat.send_message` method:```json{      &quot;context&quot;: [         &quot;my name is test&quot;,        &quot;i love coding&quot;,        &quot;my hobby's are making pictures in nature&quot;    ]  }  ```In this example, the `context` field contains an array of strings that provide additional information about the user. The strings can include any relevant information that could help the chatbot understand the context of the conversation.  &lt;/details&gt;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;YouCode example&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SilkePilon/youdotcom/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.you.com/img/app-icons/icon-youcode.svg&quot; alt=&quot;YouCode&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;#### Find code  ```pythonfrom youdotcom import Webdriver, Code # import all the classesdriver = Webdriver().driver # setting up the webdriver. use `webdriver_path=` if the pre-installed one does not work.code = Code.find_code(driver, search=&quot;how to make an python loop?&quot;) # get all the code displayed on screen. passing the driver and search string.for string in code['response']: # loop through all the code    print(string) # print 1 at an time.    print(code['time']) # print the time taken to complete you search.```  This code imports the Code and Webdriver classes from the youdotcom library. The Code class is used to search for code snippets, while the Webdriver class is used to set up a webdriver.First, the Webdriver class is instantiated with Webdriver(). The driver attribute of the resulting object is then stored in the driver variable. The driver attribute returns a webdriver object that can be used to automate web browsing tasks.Next, the find_code method of the Code class is called with driver and a search string as arguments. This method searches for code snippets related to the specified search string using the webdriver. The result of the method call is stored in the code variable.The code variable is a dictionary containing a list of code snippets in the response field and the time taken to complete the search in the time field. The code then loops through the response list and prints each code snippet to the console one at a time. Finally, the time taken to complete the search is printed to the console.  ---  #### Generate code  &gt; **Note**&gt; Code complete has an daily limit of 20 requests.```pythonfrom youdotcom import Code # import the write class text = Code.gen_code(&quot;python loop&quot;) # make an api callprint(text['response']) # print the AI made codeprint(text['time']) # print total time taken to complete your request```  This code imports the Code class from the youdotcom module. It then calls the gen_code method of the Code class, passing in the string &quot;python loop&quot; as an argument. The gen_code method makes an API call and returns a dictionary with two keys: response and time. The code then prints the value associated with the response key, which is the AI-generated code. It also prints the value associated with the time key, which is the total time taken to complete the request.  &lt;/details&gt;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Search example&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;  ```pythonfrom youdotcom import Search # import the Search classsearch_results = Search.search_for(&quot;how to make an python loop?&quot;) # search! No need to use the Webdriver class.print(search_results['results']) # print all the search resultsprint(search_results['time']) # print the total time taken (les then 3 seconds on average)```  This code imports the Search class from the youdotcom module. It then calls the search_for method of the Search class, passing in the string &quot;how to make an python loop?&quot; as an argument. The search_for method returns a dictionary with two keys: results and time. The code then prints the value associated with the results key, which is a list of search results. It also prints the value associated with the time key, which is the total time taken to perform the search.  &lt;/details&gt;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;YouWrite example&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;h1 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SilkePilon/youdotcom/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.you.com/img/app-icons/icon-youwrite.svg&quot; alt=&quot;YouCode&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  &gt; **Note**&gt; YouWrite has an daily limit of 10 requests.  ```pythonfrom youdotcom import Write # import the write class text = Write.write(&quot;how to write well?&quot;) # make an api callprint(text['response']) # print the AI made textprint(text['time']) # print total time taken to complete your request```  This code imports the Write class from the youdotcom module. It then calls the write method of the Write class, passing in the string &quot;how to write well?&quot; as an argument. The write method makes an API call and returns a dictionary with two keys: response and time. The code then prints the value associated with the response key, which is a text generated by an AI. It also prints the value associated with the time key, which is the total time taken to complete the request.  &lt;/details&gt;&gt; **Note**&gt; YouDotCom is in Alpha and there will be bugs!## Interactive shellThe YouDotCom python library offers a wide range of functionality to its users, and one of the ways in which users can access and utilize this functionality is through an interactive terminal shell. With the interactive shell, users are able to execute commands and manipulate the library in real-time, allowing for a more flexible and dynamic experience.to use the interactive shell, use the following command in your terminal:```youdotcom```you will get something like this:```bashWelcome to YouShell an interactive shell for all YouDotCom commandsEnter 'help' for a list of available commands.Type 'exit' to stop.YouShell &gt;```&gt; **Note**&gt; You may sometimes get the following error message: &gt; ```&gt; Detected a Cloudflare version 2 Captcha challenge, This feature is not available in the opensource (free) version.&gt; ```## API&gt; **Note**&gt; The request limit is 15 per minute.Welcome to the YouDotCom Python library! Our library now features an easy-to-use public API that allows you to interact with YouChat. With this API, you can easily integrate YouChat into your own projects and applications, providing a convenient and user-friendly way for you to access and utilize the capabilities of the chat bot.To get started, you will first need to get an API key on our [website](https://betterapi.net/). This key will be required to authenticate each API request.base url: `api.betterapi.net`To send a message to YouChat and receive a JSON response, you can make an HTTP GET request to the endpoint `/youdotcom/chat`, including the message to be sent as a query parameter. The key is `message` and the value should be the message text encoded in URL format. For example, to send the message `hello there`, the endpoint would be `https://api.betterapi.net/youdotcom/chat?message=hello%20there&amp;key=YOUR_API_KEY`. The JSON response will include the message sent by YouChat, time, v2Captcha, and type of the request.You also need to set your API key, you can do this by providing it as an parameter like this `/youdotcom/chat?message=hello%20there&amp;key=YOUR_API_KEY`auto updating docs can be found at: https://betterapi.net/redocMake sure to include the API key in the url of each request to authenticate it.We are constantly improving and updating the YouDotCom library and API, so make sure to check back for new features and updates.
