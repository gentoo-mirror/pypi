	<longdescription>cpymad------|Version| |Python| |Platform| |License| |Tests| |Coverage| |Citation|cpymad is a Cython_ binding to MAD-X_ for giving full control and access to aMAD-X interpreter in python... _Cython: https://cython.org/.. _MAD-X: https://cern.ch/mad**Note:** Support for 32bit builds and python 2.7 has been removed in version1.8.0. Support for python 3.5 has been removed in version 1.10.0.**Note:** python 3.6 and manylinux1 have reached EOL. Support will beremoved in a future release.Links~~~~~- `Documentation`_:    - `Installation`_    - `Getting started`_- `Source code`_:    - `MAD-X source`_- `Issue tracker`_- `Releases`_.. _Getting started: http://hibtc.github.io/cpymad/getting-started.. _Installation: http://hibtc.github.io/cpymad/installation.. _Source code: https://github.com/hibtc/cpymad.. _Documentation: http://hibtc.github.io/cpymad.. _Issue tracker: https://github.com/hibtc/cpymad/issues.. _Releases: https://pypi.org/project/cpymad.. _MAD-X source: https://github.com/MethodicalAcceleratorDesign/MAD-XLicense~~~~~~~The cpymad source code itself is under free license, see COPYING.rst_.However, the MAD-X software package and henceforth all binary cpymad packagedistributions are **NOT FREE**., see `MAD-X license`_... _COPYING.rst: https://github.com/hibtc/cpymad/blob/master/COPYING.rst.. _MAD-X license: https://github.com/MethodicalAcceleratorDesign/MAD-X/blob/master/License.txtCHANGELOG~~~~~~~~~The full changelog is available online in CHANGES.rst_... _CHANGES.rst: https://github.com/hibtc/cpymad/blob/master/CHANGES.rstReporting issues~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Note that cpymad links against a custom build of MAD-X that may differ fromthe official CERN command line client. This binary may have problems that theofficial binary does not have and vice versa.Therefore, before reporting issues, please make sure that you report to thecorrect recipient. First try to check if that problem remains when using theMAD-X command line client distributed by CERN, then report the issue:- to CERN if it can be reproduced with the official MAD-X executable- to us if it can not be reproduced with the official MAD-X executablePlease keep the code in the bug report as minimal as possible, i.e. removeeverything that can be removed such that the issue still occurs. This willsave us some effort in handling the error report.Please post the code inline, don't upload zip files, or link to externalsources, if possible.Bug reports should describe the issue and contain a minimal python scriptsimilar to this:.. code-block:: python    from cpymad.madx import Madx    m = Madx()    m.call('commands.madx')as well as the content of the ``commands.madx`` file.You can create this file from your original python code with a minimal changethat tells cpymad to write all MAD-X commands to a file:.. code-block:: python   m = Madx(command_log='commands.madx')   ...Now run this file with the official MAD-X command line client::    madx commands.madxIf ``madx`` reports the same error, check if there are any syntax errors inthe ``commands.madx`` file. These may result from incorrect usage of cpymad,or bugs in cpymad...
