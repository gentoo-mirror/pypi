	<longdescription>[This document is a copy of the original.  `The latest version isavailable on Tijmen Tieleman'shomepage. &lt;http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/gnumpy.html&gt;`_]Gnumpy is free software, but if you use it in scientific work thatgets published, you should cite `this tech report&lt;http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/gnumpyTr.pdf&gt;`_ in yourpublication.Documentation: `here&lt;http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/gnumpyDoc.html&gt;`_.Do you want to have both the compute power of GPU's and theprogramming convenience of Python numpy? Gnumpy + Cudamat will bringyou that.Gnumpy is a simple Python module that interfaces in a way almostidentical to numpy, but does its computations on your computer'sGPU. See `this example&lt;http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/gnumpy_example.py&gt;`_, training anRBM using Gnumpy.Gnumpy runs on top of, and therefore requires, the excellent `cudamat&lt;http://code.google.com/p/cudamat/&gt;`_ library, written by `Vlad Mnih&lt;http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/&gt;`_.Gnumpy can run in simulation mode: everything happens on the CPU, butthe interface is the same. This can be helpful if you like to writeyour programs on your GPU-less laptop before running them on aGPU-equipped machine. It also allows you to easily test whatperformance gain you get from using a GPU. The simulation moderequires `npmat &lt;http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ilya/npmat.py&gt;`_, writtenby `Ilya Sutskever &lt;http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ilya&gt;`_.  [npmat isincluded in this distribution.]Gnumpy is licensed with a BSD-style license (i.e. it's completely freeto use for everyone, also as a component in commercial software), withone added note: if you use it for scientific work that gets published,you must include reference to the Gnumpy tech report in yourpublication. For details of the license, see the top of gnumpy.py.Recent changes:- 2012-07-25: Bugfix. gnumpy.dot(x, x), when x is a 1-dimensional array, didn't work but now works.- 2011-06-06: gnumpy.dot() now takes arrays of ndim&gt;2.- 2011-04-19: Bugfix: several bugs involving zero size arrays were fixed.- 2011-04-15: Bugfix. &quot;x=gnumpy.zeros(10); x[array([])] = garray([])&quot; didn't work as it should. Now it does.- 2011-03-24: Added gnumpy.outer().- 2011-03-15: The ability to check for infs and nans automatically has been added to Gnumpy.- 2010-07-19: Cudamat now enables fast indexing with arrays of indices. Download the newest Cudamat to have fast indexing with arrays in Gnumpy.- 2010-07-08: Renamed the project to Gnumpy. It used to be called Gpunnumpy.</longdescription>
