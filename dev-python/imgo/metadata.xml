	<longdescription># IMGO## Process, Augment, and Balance Image DataThis library is designed to facilitate the preprocessing phase of image classification projects in order to get into the fun part: training the models!### Features:Imgo is composed of two modules: **uptools** and **augtools**.**Uptools** helps to streamline various image data preprocessing tasks, such as: - Reading images from a local disk - Rescaling images - Normalizing and standardizing pixel values - Converting image datasets into numpy-arrays - One-hot-encoding label data - Splitting image datasets into training, validation, and testing subsets - Merging data subsets into a single dataset - Saving numpy-arrays as images in class subdirectories![imgo_up_demo](aux/imgo_up_demo.jpg)**Augtools** allows the user to quickly and efficiently apply augmentation to image data. With Augtools, users can perform the following augmentation tasks using very few lines of code: - Apply a powerful collection of transformation and corruption functions - Augment images saved on a local disk - Save augmented images in class subdirectories - Augment entire image datasets - Augment training data in place in preparation for machine learning projects - Rebalance class sizes by generating new training images![imgo_aug_demo](aux/imgo_aug_demo.jpg)### InstallationIt's as easy as `pip install imgo`!### QuickstartHave a look at the demos [here](https://github.com/elbydata/imgo/tree/master/demos)!### DocumentationDocumentation is currently available in the form of docstrings.### Requirements and DependenciesPlease see the `requirements.txt` file for all requirements and dependencies.### SupportThe source code is available [here](https://github.com/elbydata/imgo/tree/master/imgo).Please direct any queries or issues to info@elbydata.com.### Issues / To doSome functions currently employ ragged arrays which are deprecated in the latest versions of NumPy. This affects all functions that work with non-standard or inconsistent image dimensions.### LicenseThe project is licensed under the MIT license.### AcknowledgementsSome of the **augtools** library is built as a wrapper around **Imgaug**, a powerful image augmentation library.
