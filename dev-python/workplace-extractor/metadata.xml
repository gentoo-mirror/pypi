It provides the following key features:* Access to the SCIM and GRAPH API provided by Facebook;* Asyncronous calls to increase speed;* Lists of **posts**, **members**, **groups**, **comments**, **event attendees** are exported to CSV files;* A ranking of most relevant members can be created based on the number of interctions (comments and reactions)* The interaction network can be wxported to a GEXF file;# Usage### InstallationTo get the Workplace Extractor package, either fork this github repo or use Pypi via pip.```sh$ pip install workplace_extractor```### How to use itYou can simple run a python script with the code below:```shimport workplace_extractorworkplace_extractor.run()```This package uses [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) and [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) to create an end-user-friendly front end GUI application. Just run the app and a dialog will show up asking for the input parameters.The application will offer some extraction options:1. **POSTS** - used for extracting all posts published in a given period of time or feed, from a given author etc.    &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisduarte/midia/main/Workplace%20App%201%20-%20Posts.png&quot; width=&quot;402&quot; height=&quot;337&quot;&gt;2. **Comments** - used for extracting all comments made in a post.    &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisduarte/midia/main/Workplace%20App%202%20-%20Comments.png&quot; width=&quot;402&quot; height=&quot;337&quot;&gt;3. **People** - used for extracting all Workplace users.    &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisduarte/midia/main/Workplace%20App%203%20-%20People.png&quot; width=&quot;402&quot; height=&quot;337&quot;&gt;4. **Groups** - used for all groups.    &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisduarte/midia/main/Workplace%20App%204%20-%20Groups.png&quot; width=&quot;402&quot; height=&quot;337&quot;&gt;5. **Members** - used for extracting all members of a group    &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisduarte/midia/main/Workplace%20App%205%20-%20Members.png&quot; width=&quot;402&quot; height=&quot;337&quot;&gt;6. **Attendees** - used for extracting all attendees of an event.    &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisduarte/midia/main/Workplace%20App%206%20-%20Attendees.png&quot; width=&quot;402&quot; height=&quot;337&quot;&gt;7. **Interactions** - used for extracting interactions among all workplace users.

Two required ones are:* **output_dir** - path the folder where the output will be stored* **access_token** - path to a file containing the Workplace access token# WarningAs many http calls are made during the export process, your program may take a while to finish, depending on the size of your Workplace installation. As a reference, on an installation with around 85,000 users, 3,000 groups and 110,000 posts the exectution takes around 4 hours to complete.# License[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)Copyright 2021 Denis DuartePermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
