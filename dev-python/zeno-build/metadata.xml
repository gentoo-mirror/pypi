The examples are  architecture agnostic, we don't care if you are using  [OpenAI](https://openai.com/),  [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), or [Hugging  Face](https://huggingface.co).- **Experiment management** and **hyperparameter optimization** code, so you can  quickly kick off experiments using a bunch of different settings and compare  the results.- **Evaluation** of LLM outputs, so you can check if your outputs are correct,  fluent, factual, interesting, or &quot;good&quot; by whatever definition of good you  prefer! Use these insights to compare models and iteratively improve your  application with model, data, or prompt engineering.Sound interesting? Read on!## Getting StartedTo get started with `zeno-build`, install the package from PyPI:```bashpip install zeno-build```Next, _start building_! Browse to the [docs](docs/) directory to get aprimer or to the [examples/](examples/) directory, where wehave a bunch of examples of how you can use `zeno-build` for different tasks,such as [chatbots](examples/chatbot/),[text summarization](examples/summarization/), or [textclassification](examples/text_classification/).Each of the examples include code for running experiments and evaluating theresults. `zeno-build` will produce a comprehensive report with the[Zeno](https://zenoml.com/) AI evaluation platform.## Interactive Demos/ReportsUsing Zeno Build, we have generated reports and online browsing demos ofstate-of-the-art systems for different popular generative AI tasks.Check out our pre-made reports below:- **Chatbots** ([Report](examples/chatbot/report/),  [Browser](https://zeno-ml-chatbot-report.hf.space/)):  A report comparing different methods  for creating chatbots, including API-based models such as ChatGPT and Cohere,  with open-source models such as Vicuna, Alpaca, and MPT.- **Translation** ([Report](examples/analysis_gpt_mt/report/),  [Browser](https://zeno-ml-translation-report.hf.space/)):  A report comparing GPT-based methods, Microsoft Translator, and the best system  from the Conference on Machine Translation.## Building Your Own Apps (and Contributing Back)Each of the examples in the [examples/](examples/) directory is specifically designedto be self-contained and easy to modify. To get started building your own apps,we suggest that you first click into the directory and read the general README,find the closest example to what you're trying to do, copy the example to thenew directory, and start hacking!If you build something cool, **we'd love for you to contribute it back**. Wewelcome pull requests of both new examples, new reports for existing examples,and new functionality for the core `zeno_build` library. If this is of interestto you, please click through to our [contributing doc](contributing.md) doc tolearn more.## CITATIONTo cite [GPT-MT report](examples/analysis_gpt_mt/README.md), please use thefollowing BibTeX/APA entry.### BibTeX```bibtex@misc{Neubig_Zeno_GPT_Machine_2023,  author = {      Neubig, Graham and       He, Zhiwei  },  title = {{Zeno GPT Machine Translation Report}},  year = {2023}}```### APA```bibtexNeubig, G., &amp; He, Z. (2023). Zeno GPT Machine Translation Report```## Get in TouchIf you have any questions, feature requests, bug reports, etc., we recommendgetting in touch via the github [issuespage](https://github.com/zeno-ml/zeno-build/issues) or[discord](https://discord.gg/km62pDKAkE), where the community can discuss and/orimplement your suggestions!</longdescription>
