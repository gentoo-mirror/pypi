	<longdescription># eudisteudist is a library to caculate EUclidean DISTances.eudist can calculate for example the distance between a point and aplane in 3D.  A version with the signed distance is also available,which can be used to check whether two points are on the same side ofthe plane.It can also be used to check if a point is within a polygon, using the`winding_number` calculation.
