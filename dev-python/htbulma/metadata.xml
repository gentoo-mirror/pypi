	<longdescription>## htbulma = &quot;HTag bulma&quot;Example of gui toolkit using [htag](https://github.com/manatlan/htag).&lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/htbulma/&quot;&gt;    &lt;img src=&quot;https://badge.fury.io/py/htbulma.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Package version&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**Just to be clear** : This module is just for me ;-). It's just here to demonstrate that you can build a py3 module, containnig a set of [htag](https://github.com/manatlan/htag)'s components, ready to be used, in you [htag](https://github.com/manatlan/htag) app.Of course, you can use it, at your own risk. But be aware that : * the current components may change completly (and broke your apps) * many of them are not well coded (80% coming from the old gtag, and 70% are not using the last htag features in the right place) Theses are my components, for my quick's htag apps ;-), for demo'ing the htag goal !I'd love too see a real module, well maintained, with high-end and clever components (but I have no time to manage that, focusing on other projects (ex: htag)) - [See an example (in client side only (pyscript))](https://raw.githack.com/manatlan/htag/main/examples/pyscript_htbulma.html) - [See an example (in server side (on glitch.com))](https://htag.glitch.me/Test?app=c99)</longdescription>
