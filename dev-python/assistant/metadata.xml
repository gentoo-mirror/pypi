Because you deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;## RequirementsYou need `python 3` with the following requirements:   - `Python 3.x`      - [`Domain Management Tool`](https://gitlab.com/waser-technologies/technologies/dmt)      - (optional) [`say`](https://gitlab.com/waser-technologies/technologies/say)      - (optional) [`listen`](https://gitlab.com/waser-technologies/technologies/listen)   - min. 12 Gb RAM   - min. 30 Gb availible disk space   - (optional, recommended) min. 11 Gb VRAM on a Nvidia GPU   - May require an internet connection to download the models initially## InstallationTo install `Assistant` use `pip`:```bashpip install assistant```Using an arch based distro. (Availible on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-assistant) and pre-built on [Singularity](https://github.com/wasertech/singularity/releases/tag/x86_64))```zshpacman -S python-assistant```From source:```bashpip install -U git+https://gitlab.com/waser-technologies/technologies/assistant.git```From local source```bashgit clone https://gitlab.com/waser-technologies/technologies/assistant.git ./assistantcd assistantpip install -U .```## Start the serviceTo talk with Assistant, you need to load the service up first.```bashcp ./assistant.service.example /usr/usr/lib/systemd/user/assistant.servicesystemctl --user enable --now dmt assistant```(optional) enable listen for assistant```bashcp ./assistant.listen.service.example /usr/usr/lib/systemd/user/assistant.listen.servicesystemctl --user enable --now assistant.listen```Or manually from python:```bashdmt -S &amp; # load the NLP models #sleep 60 &amp;&amp; # wait for the models to load #    python -m assistant.as_service &amp; # Assistance is a service #    python -m listen.STT.as_service &amp; # optional #   # let assistant listen when you speak #    python -m assistant.listen```Once the service is up, you can type or say `assistant`.Note that you need the `dmt` service loaded up first. First time you use the `dmt` to serve NLP models with `rasa`, the `dmt` will download the latest pre-build models for your language and install the required domains.However it's recommended that you acually use the `dmt` to train your own models based on the domains you want to use and have installed.```# List installed domainsdmt -L# Validate the data and traindmt -V -T# You now can serve your last trained modeldmt -S```## UsageJust call `Assistant` like any other shell.```bash‚ùØ assistant --helpusage: assistant [-h] [-V] [-c COMMAND] [-i] [-l] [--rc RC [RC ...]] [--no-rc]                 [--no-script-cache] [--cache-everything] [-D ITEM]                 [--shell-type {b,best,d,dumb,ptk,ptk1,ptk2,prompt-toolkit,prompt_toolkit,prompt-toolkit1,prompt-toolkit2,prompt-toolkit3,prompt_toolkit3,ptk3,rand,random,rl,readline}]                 [--timings]                 [script-file] ...Assistant: a clever shell implementationpositional arguments:  script-file           If present, execute the script in script-file or (if                        not present) execute as a command and exit.  args                  Additional arguments to the script (or command)                        specified by script-file.optional arguments:  -h, --help            Show help and exit.  -V, --version         Show version information and exit.  -c COMMAND            Run a single command and exit.  -i, --interactive     Force running in interactive mode.  -l, --login           Run as a login shell.  --rc RC [RC ...]      RC files to load.  --no-rc               Do not load any rc files.  --no-script-cache     Do not cache scripts as they are run.  --cache-everything    Use a cache, even for interactive commands.  -D ITEM               Define an environment variable, in the form of                        -DNAME=VAL. May be used many times.  --shell-type {b,best,d,dumb,ptk,ptk1,ptk2,prompt-toolkit,prompt_toolkit,prompt-toolkit1,prompt-toolkit2,prompt-toolkit3,prompt_toolkit3,ptk3,rand,random,rl,readline}                        What kind of shell should be used. Possible options:                        readline, prompt_toolkit, random. Warning! If set this                        overrides $SHELL_TYPE variable.  --timings             Prints timing information before the prompt is shown.                        This is useful while tracking down performance issues                        and investigating startup times.‚ùØ assistant HiHey, how are you today?‚ùØ assistant -c &quot;what time is it&quot;The current time is 1:35 p.m.‚ùØ assistant -i -l --no-rc --no-script-cache -DPATH=&quot;PATH:/share/assistant/&quot;‚ùØ assistant script.nlp```## ExamplesThe examples below are produced in interactive mode.### Jaques √† dit: r√©pond```assistant‚ùØ echo HelloHello‚ùØ say Hello World # This requires say to be installedHello World‚ùØ Hi Assistant.Hello $USERNAME.```### Navigate files```assistant‚ùØ Where am IYou are at home.‚ùØ Open DocumentsYou are now in the Documents directory inside home.‚ùØ What do we have here?Listing the current working directory....```### Get to the bottom of thingsUsing [WebSearch](https://gitlab.com/waser-technologies/data/nlu/en/web-search) domain, you can get pretty meaningful answers.```assistant‚ùØ How many moons does Saturn have?I'll need a moment.‚ùØ Take your time.I think I have found the answer to how many moons Saturn has.Saturn has 83 moons.‚ùØ How old is the universe?Give me a moment.I know how old the universe is.The universe is 13.7 billion years old.```### Exit the sessionTo exit the current session, you can type pretty much anything. As long as `Assistant` can reasonnably understand your intent.*i.e.* :```assistant‚ùØ exit‚ùØ Q‚ùØ :q‚ùØ quit‚ùØ stop()‚ùØ terminate‚ùØ This conversation is over.‚ùØ Stop this session.```## Using voice### Text-To-SpeechAssistant can talk. Just install [`say`](https://gitlab.com/waser-technologies/technologies/say) and authorize the system to speak. Make sure the service is running and Assistant should be able to connect to it.Within an interactve session with Assistant, you can toggle TTS using either:  - the `Interface` menu,   - the keyboard shortcut `[Ctrl] + [S]`  - Assistant by authorizing it to speak (e.g. `assistant you can speak now`).```assistantassistant say Hello World and welcome to everyone.```### Speech-To-TextAssistant can also understand when you talk. Just install [`listen`](https://gitlab.com/waser-technologies/technologies/listen) and authorize the system to listen. Make sure `listen.service`, `assistant.service` and `assistant.listen.service` are enabled for Assistant to be able to pick up what you say.By default, neither the accoustic model nor the language model are ajusted for Assistant, so it's a good idea to at least create a custom scorer using the STT Training Wizard.```zshtrainer=~/.assistant/trainers/stt.traingit archive --remote=git@gitlab.com:waser-technologies/models/en/stt.git HEAD | tar xvf - model.trainmv model.train $trainerchmod +x $trainerzsh $trainer```## Use Assistant as your default shell&gt; **This is not recommended in alpha!**You sould be able to add the location of `assistant` at the end of `/etc/shells`. You'll then be able to set `Assistant` as your default shell using `chsh`.```bashsudo sh -c 'w=$(which assistant); echo $w &gt;&gt; /etc/shells'chsh -s $(which assistant)```Log out and when you come back, `Assistant` will be your default shell.## ContributionsYou like the projet and want to improve upon it?Checkout [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) to see how you might be able to help.## CreditsThanks to all the projects that make this possible:- [Xonsh](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh): the best snail in the jungle- [RASA](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa): so Assistant can answer at all- [coqui-STT](https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT): so you can speak too- [coqui-TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS): so Assistant can reply out-loud- And many many many more.</longdescription>
