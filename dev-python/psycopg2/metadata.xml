	<longdescription>Psycopg is the most popular PostgreSQL database adapter for the Pythonprogramming language.  Its main features are the complete implementation ofthe Python DB API 2.0 specification and the thread safety (several threads canshare the same connection).  It was designed for heavily multi-threadedapplications that create and destroy lots of cursors and make a large numberof concurrent &quot;INSERT&quot;s or &quot;UPDATE&quot;s.Psycopg 2 is mostly implemented in C as a libpq wrapper, resulting in beingboth efficient and secure.  It features client-side and server-side cursors,asynchronous communication and notifications, &quot;COPY TO/COPY FROM&quot; support.Many Python types are supported out-of-the-box and adapted to matchingPostgreSQL data types; adaptation can be extended and customized thanks to aflexible objects adaptation system.Psycopg 2 is both Unicode and Python 3 friendly.Documentation-------------Documentation is included in the ``doc`` directory and is `available online`__... __: https://www.psycopg.org/docs/For any other resource (source code repository, bug tracker, mailing list)please check the `project homepage`__... __: https://psycopg.org/Installation------------Building Psycopg requires a few prerequisites (a C compiler, some developmentpackages): please check the install_ and the faq_ documents in the ``doc`` diror online for the details.If prerequisites are met, you can install psycopg like any other Pythonpackage, using ``pip`` to download it from PyPI_::    $ pip install psycopg2or using ``setup.py`` if you have downloaded the source package locally::    $ python setup.py build    $ sudo python setup.py installYou can also obtain a stand-alone package, not requiring a compiler orexternal libraries, by installing the `psycopg2-binary`_ package from PyPI::    $ pip install psycopg2-binaryThe binary package is a practical choice for development and testing but inproduction it is advised to use the package built from sources... _PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/.. _psycopg2-binary: https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2-binary/.. _install: https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html#install-from-source.. _faq: https://www.psycopg.org/docs/faq.html#faq-compile:Linux/OSX: |gh-actions|:Windows: |appveyor|.. |gh-actions| image:: https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg    :target: https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/actions/workflows/tests.yml    :alt: Linux and OSX build status.. |appveyor| image:: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/psycopg/psycopg2?branch=master&amp;svg=true    :target: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/psycopg/psycopg2/branch/master    :alt: Windows build status</longdescription>
