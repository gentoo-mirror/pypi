	<longdescription># FBPCP (Facebook Private Computation Platform)[Secure multi-party computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) (also known as secure computation, multi-party computation (MPC), or privacy-preserving computation) is a subfield of cryptography with the goal of creating methods for parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private.FBPCP (Facebook Private Computation Platform) is a secure, privacy safe and scalable architecture to deploy MPC (Multi Party Computation) applications in a distributed way on virtual private clouds. [FBPCF](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fbpcf) (Facebook Private Computation Framework) is for scaling MPC computation up via threading, while FBPCP is for scaling MPC computation out via [Private Scaling](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fbpcp/blob/main/docs/PrivateScaling.md) architecture. FBPCP consists of various services, interfaces that enable various private measurement solutions, e.g. [Private Lift](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fbpcf/blob/master/docs/PrivateLift.md).[Private Scaling](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fbpcp/blob/main/docs/PrivateScaling.md) resembles the map/reduce architecture and is secure against a semi-honest adversary who tries to learn the inputs of the computation. The goal is to secure the intermediate output of each shard to prevent potential privacy leak.## Installation Requirements:### Prerequisites for working on Ubuntu 18.04:* An AWS account (Access Key ID, Secret Access Key) to use AWS SDK (boto3 API) in FBPCP* python &gt;= 3.8* python3-pip## Installing prerequisites on Ubuntu 18.04:* python3.8```shsudo apt-get install -y python3.8```* python3-pip```shsudo apt-get install -y python3-pip```## Installing fbpcp```shpython3.8 -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/fbpcp.git'# (add --user if you don't have permission)# Or, to install it from a local clone:git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/fbpcp.gitpython3.8 -m pip install -e fbpcp# (add --user if you don't have permission)# Or, to install it from Pypipython3.8 -m pip install fbpcp```## Upgrading fbpcp* To latest version in github main branch```shpython3.8 -m pip uninstall fbpcp# uninstall fbpcp firstpython3.8 -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/fbpcp.git'# (add --user if you don't have permission)# re-install fbpcp from github repository```* To latest version in Pypi```shpython3.8 -m pip install fbpcp --upgrade```## Architecture&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/facebookresearch/fbpcp/blob/main/docs/PCPArch.jpg?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1: Architecture of FBPCP&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;### Services:* MPCService is the public interface that provides APIs to distribute a MPC application with large dataset to multiple MPC workers on cloud.### [Other components](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fbpcp/blob/main/docs/FBPCPComponents.md)## Join the FBPCP community* Website: https://github.com/facebookresearch/fbpcp* See the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fbpcp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for how to help out.## LicenseFBPCP is [MIT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fbpcp/blob/main/LICENSE) licensed, as found in the LICENSE file.</longdescription>
