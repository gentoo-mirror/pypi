Get your cookie string, open the daily check in page   * [Daily Check-in page for Genshin Impact](https://act.hoyolab.com/ys/event/signin-sea-v3/index.html?act_id=e202102251931481)   * [Daily Check-in page for Honkai: Star Rail](https://act.hoyolab.com/bbs/event/signin/hkrpg/index.html?act_id=e202303301540311)   * [Daily Check-in page for Honkai Impact 3rd](https://act.hoyolab.com/bbs/event/signin-bh3/index.html?act_id=e202110291205111)   * [Daily Check-in page for Tears of Themis](https://act.hoyolab.com/bbs/event/signin/nxx/index.html?act_id=e202202281857121)2. Open a development console (F12) and insert the following code:    ```javascript    document.cookie    ```3. Copy the returned string should be something like &quot;ltoken=....; account_id=....;&quot; this is your cookie string4. Open a terminal with the command prepared and enter:    ```bash    $ hoyo-daily-logins-helper --cookie=&quot;your cookie string&quot; --genshin    ```   (or ``--starrail`` for Honkai Star Rail)5. Done!## Installation### DockerThe command line options are also available via environment variables whichallows you to easily run this script in Docker/Podman!```bash$ docker run --rm --env HOYO_GAME=starrail --env HOYO_COOKIE=&quot;your cookie string&quot; ghcr.io/atomicptr/hoyo-daily-logins-helper```### pip```bash$ pipx install hoyo-daily-logins-helper```**Note**: While regular pip should work, it's highly recommended installing thistool via [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) instead!PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/hoyo-daily-logins-helper/## Configuration### CookieYou can provide the cookie information either via the **HOYO_COOKIE** environment variable or using the --cookie CLI flag.### GameYou can provide the cookie information either via the **HOYO_GAME** environment variable or using the --game NAME/--genshin/--starrail CLI flags.**Supported Games**:* Genshin Impact (genshin)* Honkai: Star Rail (starrail)* Honkai Impact 3rd (honkai)* Tears of Themis (themis)### Debug modeIf something doesn't work properly and/or you want to report an issue try running the tool with the **HOYO_DEBUG** environment variable set to 1! Or provide the --debug flag!```bash$ HOYO_DEBUG=1 hoyo-daily-logins-helper --starrail --cookie=&quot;...&quot;```### LanguageIf you want to see the results in other languages than English you can change it via the **HOYO_LANGUAGE** environment variable or the --language CLI flag```bash$ HOYO_LANGUAGE=ja-jp hoyo-daily-logins-helper --genshin --cookie=&quot;...&quot;```### Multiple accountsYou can run this tool for multiple accounts at once:```bash$ hoyo-daily-logins-helper --game genshin --cookie &quot;cookie for acc 1&quot; --game starrail --cookie &quot;cookie for acc 2&quot;```If you want to do this with environment variables it works basically the same, you just have to separate the values by a &quot;,&quot;```bash$ HOYO_GAME=genshin,starrail HOYO_COOKIE=&quot;cookie 1 data...,cookie 2 data...&quot; hoyo-daily-logins-helper```Although I'd recommend you to use a configuration file for this (see the next point)### Configuration fileIf there is a file called &quot;**hoyo-daily-logins-helper.toml**&quot; in the current working directory (or you provided one via --config-file) the tool will read data from there.```bash$ hoyo-daily-logins-helper --config-file ~/path/to/custom-config-file.toml```Content:```toml# you can configurate some things here like the language or the user agent# keep in mind that config and every key in there is optional and you can omit it[config]# i'd recommend against changing this value unless you know what you are doing# not setting this will make it look to the developer like we are using a normal# web browser while this is very suspicioususer_agent = &quot;My fancy user agent&quot;# the language of the rewards and presumably return messages from the APIlanguage = &quot;en-us&quot;# every account starts with this index/key [[accounts]]# accounts can have identifiers for you to differentiate them in the logs# you could for instance add your account name or UID hereidentifier = &quot;My Genshin Account Name&quot;# the game identifier which has to be genshin or starrailgame = &quot;genshin&quot;# and the cookie valuecookie = &quot;My Genshin Cookie...&quot;# repeat this for every other account you might have[[accounts]]identifier = &quot;My Starrail Account #1&quot;game = &quot;starrail&quot;cookie = &quot;My Starrail Cookie...&quot;[[accounts]]identifier = &quot;My Starrail Account #2&quot;game = &quot;starrail&quot;cookie = &quot;My Starrail Cookie...&quot;```## Scheduler modeScheduler mode **can only be used if you are working with a configuration file**. Toenable the scheduler mode, set ``enable_scheduler = true`` in the `config` section.```toml[config]# ...enable_scheduler = true[[accounts]]# ....```### Discord notificationsIf you want to ping a Discord channel, [create a webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) and add it to the configuration:```toml[config]# ...notifications = [    {type = &quot;discord&quot;, webhook_url = &quot;https://....&quot;}][[accounts]]# ....```You can globally disable failure or success reports by adding the ```on``` property to the webhook```toml[config]# ...notifications = [    {type = &quot;discord&quot;, webhook_url = &quot;https://....&quot;, on = [&quot;failure&quot;]}][[accounts]]# ....```You can also set accounts to only report on failure if you set the ```report_on``` property.```toml[conifg]# ...[[accounts]]game = &quot;genshin&quot;report_on = [&quot;failure&quot;]```### Adjusting schedule timesThe daily logins reset is globally the same at 00:00 Asia/Shanghai, but for variousreasons you might want to delay this, so we added an option for this in the accounts section.```toml[config]# ...[[accounts]]game = &quot;genshin&quot;# example for configuring everythingcheckin_time = {hour = 17, minute = 0, timezone = &quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;}[[accounts]]game = &quot;starrail&quot;# example for only configurating this partially, in this case we want to have the script run at 00:42checkin_time = {minute = 42}```## LicenseGNU General Public License v3![](https://www.gnu.org/graphics/gplv3-127x51.png)</longdescription>
