	<longdescription># ComiconComicon is a lightweight comic converter library between CBZ, PDF, EPUB, and MOBI that preserves metadata. Once Comicon has converted a comic, it is **guaranteed** that the reverse conversion will restore the original comic with all of its original metadata.## UsageFor a command line interface, please see [Mandown](https://github.com/potatoeggy/mandown).```pythonimport comiconcomicon.convert(&quot;comic.cbz&quot;, &quot;comic.epub&quot;)```## InstallationAmazon's **Kindlegen** is required if you want to convert to MOBI. See [here](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/issues/371) for more information.Comicon is available from PyPI:```pip install comicon```## Supported conversions| Format | Convert from?      | Convert to?        || ------ | ------------------ | ------------------ || CBZ    | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: || EPUB   | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: || PDF    | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: || MOBI   | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark: |### Format discrepancies- Only EPUB supports a table of contents. CBZ and PDF will encode the table of contents so that it is restored upon converting to EPUB.- PDF does not support importing genre data due to a lack of library support. This may be worked around in the future.## NotesUnder the hood, Comicon converts each format into the **Comicon Intermediate Representation (CIR)** â€” more or less a strictly structured folder, which allows for many guarantees to be made for each input and output plugin. See `comicon.cirtools` for more information.For new input and output formats to be added, they should be added in `comicon.inputs` or `comicon.outputs` respectively as a new module and in the `__init__.py` file(s).</longdescription>
