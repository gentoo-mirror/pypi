It provides a Bootstrap 4 based userinterface, role based authentication and a number of generic DjangoViews that provide great looking and feature-rich lists and forms.-  Lists support sorting, searching, links, nested fields, custom   columns and data sources not only from databases but also from APIs-  The Forms have enhanced widgets for DateTime, AutoComplete and   MultiSelect and also support custom layouts without having to create   extra templates... figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanoma/django-arctic/master/docs/img/arctic_screenshot.png   :alt: arctic screenshot   arctic screenshotWhy---There are a lot of content management systems in the market that are agood fit for the creation of many web sites. Most CMSâ€™s make assumptionsabout the data model for posts, authentication and the administrationinterface.There is however a tipping point, where customizing a CMS product is soextensive that it ends up being better to use some lower levelframework.This is the case that Arctic wants to solve, creation of a CMS with ahigh degree of customization. Instead of being a ready-to-use CMS,Arctic is a framework that facilitates the construction of contentmanagement systems.Compatibility--------------  Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9-  Django 2.2, 3.0, 3.1.. |PyPi version| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/django-arctic.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-arctic/.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/dpgmediamagazines/django-arctic.svg?branch=develop   :target: https://travis-ci.org/dpgmediamagazines/django-arctic.. |Coverage Status| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/dpgmediamagazines/django-arctic/badge.svg?branch=develop   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/dpgmediamagazines/django-arctic.. |Read the Docs| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/django-arctic/badge/?version=latest   :target: https://django-arctic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.. |Downloads| image:: https://pepy.tech/badge/django-arctic/month   :target: https://pepy.tech/project/django-arctic/month</longdescription>
