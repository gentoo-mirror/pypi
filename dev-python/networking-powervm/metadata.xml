	<longdescription>=========================PowerVM Neutron ML2 Agent=========================The `IBM PowerVM hypervisor`_ provides virtualization on POWER hardware.PowerVM operators can see benefits in their environments by making use ofOpenStack. This project implements a ML2 compatible agent that providescapability for PowerVM admins to natively use OpenStack Neutron.  This agent istied to the Shared Ethernet Adapter technology which is currently the typicalscenario for PowerVM network virtualization... _IBM PowerVM hypervisor: http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247940.html?OpenProblem description===================This project provides a ML2 compatible agent for the PowerVM hypervisor.It is paired to the `nova-powervm`_ driver.This PowerVM agent provides support for VLAN networks across SharedEthernet Adapters.  It provisions the VLANs on the Virtual I/O Servers(VIOS) to support the client workload, via the PowerVM REST API.  The Novacomponent will set up the peer adapter as part of VIF plugging.Only networks of physical type VLAN are supported... _nova-powervm: https://launchpad.net/nova-powervmUse Cases---------* Deploy a VLAN to the specified Virtual I/O Server (or pair of servers) as  deploys occur.* Periodic heal of the systems (similar to Open vSwitch agent design).* Periodic optimization (removal of unused VLANs from the Shared Ethernet  Adapters) of the system.* Heartbeat of the agent.Project Priority----------------NoneData model impact-----------------NoneREST API impact---------------NoneSecurity impact---------------NoneNotifications impact--------------------NoneOther end user impact---------------------None to end user.Performance Impact------------------No performance impact.  Deploy operations should not be impacted by using thisagent.Other deployer impact---------------------The operator needs to obtain the agent from the code repository.  The cloudadministrator needs to install the agent on both the Neutron controller as wellas on the compute node.The operator will then need to configure the bridge_mappings, to define in theCONF file how to map the physical networks to the adapters.  No furtherconfiguration is required for the operator.  If only one physical networkexists (the default), and a single Shared Ethernet Adapter, no bridge_mappingconfiguration is required.  The agent will assume the default network maps tothat single Shared Ethernet Adapter (or single pair SEAs set up for redundancy).Redundant Shared Ethernet Adapters (as defined by the `PowerVM Redbook`_) arefully supported by this agent... _PowerVM Redbook: http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247940.htmlDeveloper impact----------------NoneImplementation==============Assignee(s)-----------Primary assignee:  thorstOther contributors:  wpward  svenkat  efriedDependencies============* The Neutron ML2 Plugin.* Utilizes the PowerVM REST API specification for management.  Will  utilize future versions of this specification as it becomes available:  http://ibm.co/1lThV9R* Builds on top of the `pypowervm`_ library.  An open-source, python based  library that interacts with the PowerVM REST API... _pypowervm: https://github.com/powervm/pypowervmTesting=======Tempest Tests-------------Since the tempest tests should be implementation agnostic, the existingtempest tests should be able to run against the PowerVM agent without issue.Thorough unit tests exist within the agent that validate specific functionsfor this implementation.Functional Tests----------------A third party functional test environment has been created.  It monitorsincoming Neutron change sets.  Once it detects a new change set, it shouldexecute the existing lifecycle API tests.  A non-gating vote (+1 or -1) willbe provided with information provided (logs) based on the result.Work continues in this area.API Tests---------No changes (no new APIs)References==========* Neutron ML2 Plugin: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron/ML2* PowerVM REST API Initial Specification (may require newer versions as they  become available): http://ibm.co/1lThV9R* PowerVM Virtualization Introduction and Configuration:  http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247940.html* PowerVM Best Practices: http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg248062.html</longdescription>
