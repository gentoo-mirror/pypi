	<longdescription>Mammoth is a data management platform that allows you to take your data from its raw state to insights with all the steps in between. More specifically Mammoth allows you to:1. Upload data or fetch data from various data sources2. Warehouse this data3. Transform data through an iterative process of discovery, preparation, blending, and insights4. Save process steps to a task pipeline so that any data changes in the future can go through the same steps automatically5. Use the prepared data for dashboarding or reporting either within Mammoth or in a dashboarding system outside of Mammoth6. You use Mammoth to implement a data flow pipeline where your data traverses through successive transformations to produce output. The process is feedback driven where you get to do data discovery along the way.
