It aims to make the use of `ZODB` simple by providing ready-to-use tools and explicit tools. sheraf is currently compatible with `ZODB 5` and `python 3.7+`.You can expect sheraf to:- Do few things, but do them right;- Be simple enough so beginners can do a lot with a few lines;- Be powerful enough and tunable for python experts;- Have a simple and expressive code, that allows you to hack it if needed.## Installationsheraf is compatible with Python 3.7+    poetry add sheraf    # or    pip install sherafIf you need pytest fixtures for your project check out [pytest-sheraf](https://gitlab.com/yaal/pytest-sheraf). There are also [sheraf fixtures for unittest](https://gitlab.com/yaal/unittest-sheraf).    pip install pytest-sheraf## ContributingBug reports and pull requests are highly encouraged! - Test some code : `poetry run pytest` and `poetry run tox` - Format code :Â `black` - Generate documentation : `poetry run tox -e doc`## DocumentationYou can build it with the following commands, or read it on [readthedocs](https://sheraf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).    poetry run tox -e doc    open build/sphinx/html/index.html## Development installationsheraf use poetry as its main build tool.
