However, the problemhas been accessibility.[Association of Finnish Municipalities](https://www.localfinland.fi/) hasrecommended that municipalities publish their purchase data in an easy-accessible format on internet. As a result, a growing number ofmunicipalities has published their data in[opendata.fi](https://www.avoindata.fi/en) so that everyone has access to it.The purchase data is published on the website in csv or Excel format.Despite the guideline of the Association regarding the publishing, at leastolder datasets lack of standardization. For example, other municipality mightuse other format while others prefer using different format. This means thatdatasets between municipalities are not directly compatible with each other.The osta package aims to resolve the forementioned problem. Below, is anillustration of a workflow utilizing osta package.&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TuomasBorman/osta/master/docs/figures/osta_workflow.png&quot; /&gt;There are three modules in the osta package. While wrangle contains genericmethods for data manipulation, import and enrich in importing and enrichingthe data, respectively.The workflow starts by searching and importing the data from opendata.fi(searchData, getData). Because there are differences in naming formats,the names of the fields can differ. This means that the type of data in eachcolumn, such as date information or municipality name, must be detected(detectFields).After column names are standardized, clean method can be used to standardizethe values of each column. Furthermore, it can be utilized to errors from thedata. After standarzization, multiple datasets can be merged into one withmerge method.The user can fetch data from different sources. getMuni, getMuniFin,getMuniComp, getMuniMap, and getComp offer convenient connection to differentdatabases. The fetched datasets can be then merged to purchase data withenrich method.To organize the data to match with the Association's guideline, one can useorganize method. For instance, it can be used to rename the columns and toremove sensitive data of private people carrying a trade. After themanipulation step, the data is ready for analysis.See [the osta package demo](https://github.com/TuomasBorman/osta/blob/main/vignettes/osta.ipynb),that shows how the package can be utilized to create a purchase data analysisworkflow.</longdescription>
