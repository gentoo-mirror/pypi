	<longdescription># SatFlow***Sat***ellite Optical ***Flow*** with machine learning models.The goal of this repo is to improve upon optical flow models for predictingfuture satellite images from current and past ones, focused primarily on EUMETSAT data.## InstallationClone the repository, then run```shellconda env create -f environment.ymlconda activate satflowpip install -e .````Alternatively, you can also install a usually older version through ```pip install satflow```## DataThe data used here is a combination of the UK Met Office's rainfall radar data, EUMETSAT MSGsatellite data (12 channels), derived data from the MSG satellites (cloud masks, etc.), andnumerical weather prediction data. Currently, some example transformed EUMETSAT data can be downloadedfrom the tagged release, as well as included under ```datasets/```.</longdescription>
