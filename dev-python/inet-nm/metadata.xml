This tooladdresses a common challenge faced by many teams - keeping track ofmultiple hardware variants and efficiently running tests across theseplatforms.In the context of managing a large variety of boards such as Nucleoboards, SAM XPro, ESPs and more, inet_nm comes into play by providingfunctionalities like:* Tracking currently plugged-in boards and previously connected boards* Running scripts on individual boards with lockfiles to prevent  conflicts* Maintaining board information and managing new boards with minimal  overhead* Offering a tmux session for interactive control and automatically  releasing the node on session close* Identifying boards by their featuresAll these features are designed to make managing numerous developmentboards more manageable and efficient, particularly for teams maintaininglarge open-source projects like RIOT OS.## Installation### As a developer or single userYou can install inet_nm via pip or pipx (recommended to use a venv):```bashpip install inet-nm```### On a shared computer for CIIf you have one computer where many different users may want to access theboards it may be better to setup for all users.First change the config dir to a shared path (by default we select `/etc/environment`):```sudo sed -i '/NM_CONFIG_DIR/d' /etc/environment &amp;&amp; echo 'NM_CONFIG_DIR=/etc/inet-nm' | sudo tee -a /etc/environment```Then install with pip system-wide```sudo pip install inet-nm```Now all users should be able to access the cli functions. Note that `sudo` willbe needed to make any changes such as commissioning boards or updating boardnames.## UsageBelow is the usage for each of the command-line applications included in inet_nm:### inet-nm-update-from-osThis command is used to cache a list of boards and features. Thedefault commands are compatible with [RIOT OS](https://www.riot-os.org/) butcan be overridden for other systems.```$ inet-nm-update-from-os -husage: inet-nm-update-from-os [-h] [-c CONFIG] [-i BOARD_INFO] [-f BOARD_FEATURES] [-n BOARD_ENV_VAR] basedirCache a list of boardspositional arguments:  basedir               Path to the board path directoryoptional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG                        Path to the config dir  -i BOARD_INFO, --board-info BOARD_INFO                        Command to get board info, defaults to 'make info-boards'  -f BOARD_FEATURES, --board-features BOARD_FEATURES                        Command to get board features, defaults to 'make info-features-provided'  -n BOARD_ENV_VAR, --board-env-var BOARD_ENV_VAR                        The env var to indicate the board name for features provided, defaults to 'BOARD'```### inet-nm-update-commissionedThis command is used to update commissioned features, usually after`inet-nm-update-from-os` is called.```$ inet-nm-update-commissioned -husage: inet-nm-update-commissioned [-h] [-c CONFIG]```### inet-nm-commissionThis is an interactive prompt to new commission USB boards.```$ inet-nm-commission -husage: inet-nm-commission [-h] [-c CONFIG] [-b BOARD] [-n]```### inet-nm-checkThis command is used to check the list of boards given some conditions.```$ inet-nm-check -husage: inet-nm-check [-h] [-c CONFIG] [-f FEAT_FILTER [FEAT_FILTER ...]] [-a] [-m] [-e FEAT_EVAL] [-u] [-s] [--show-features]```### Environment VariablesWhen executing a script or running interactively,[env vars are available](src/inet_nm/data_types.py):```NM_IDX: Index of the node.NM_UID: Unique ID of the node.NM_SERIAL: Serial number of the node.NM_BOARD: Board of the node.NM_PORT: Port of the node.```There is also an environment variable to specify the default configurationdirectory.```NM_CONFIG_DIR```### inet-nm-execThis command is used to send execute a command or script. It will block the nodesuntil it is finished.```$ inet-nm-exec -husage: inet-nm-exec [-h] [-t TIMEOUT] [-c CONFIG] [-f FEAT_FILTER [FEAT_FILTER ...]] [-a] [-m] [-e FEAT_EVAL] [-u] [-s] cmd```### inet-nm-tmuxThis command is used to manage nodes in a tmux session. It will block the nodesuntil the session is over.```inet-nm-tmux -husage: inet-nm-tmux [-h] [-w] [-t TIMEOUT] [-x CMD] [-c CONFIG] [-f FEAT_FILTER [FEAT_FILTER ...]] [-a] [-m] [-e FEAT_EVAL] [-u] [-s]```### inet-nm-from-uidThis command finds the tty of a node given the UID. This is useful if a nodegets reconnected during an interactive session.```$ inet-nm-tty-from-uid -husage: inet-nm-tty-from-uid [-h] [-c CONFIG] uid```## Example WorkflowUp-to-date examples are available at [`docs/cli-example.md`](docs/cli-example.md).1. First update the boards list in the cache to allow for autocomplete andfeatures.```$ inet-nm-update-from-os RIOT/examples/hello-world/Getting features_provided for acd52832Getting features_provided for adafruit-clue...Getting features_provided for z1Getting features_provided for zigduinoUpdated /home/weiss/.config/inet_nm/board_info.json```2. Then plug in a new board, or many new boards and commission them.Note that you can use autocomplete to help select the board name.```$ inet-nm-commissionFound 3 saved nodes in ~/.config/inet_nm[?] Select the node: /dev/ttyACM1 Atmel Corp. Xplained Pro board debugger and programmer ATML2769041800000967 &gt; /dev/ttyACM1 Atmel Corp. Xplained Pro board debugger and programmer ATML2769041800000967   /dev/ttyACM0 STMicroelectronics ST-LINK/V2.1 066DFF545150898367074730Select board name for Atmel Corp. Xplained Pro board debugger and programmer&gt; saml1saml10-xpro        saml11-xpro&gt; saml11-xproUpdated /home/user/.config/inet_nm/nodes.json```3. Check to see what unused, connected board are available.```$ inet-nm-check{  &quot;b-l072z-lrwan1&quot;: 2,  &quot;esp32-wroom-32&quot;: 1,  &quot;frdm-kw41z&quot;: 1,  &quot;nucleo-l452re&quot;: 1,  &quot;remote-revb&quot;: 1,  &quot;saml11-xpro&quot;: 1}```4. Prepare a board selection to use only one board of each type that have a given feature.```$ inet-nm-check -f bootloader_stm32 -s{  &quot;b-l072z-lrwan1&quot;: 1,  &quot;nucleo-l452re&quot;: 1}```5. Interactively open a terminal to those boards.Note, tmux can enable synced panes with `:setw synchronize-panes`.```$ inet-nm-tmux -f bootloader_stm32 -s``````$ printenv | grep NM_NM_BOARD=nucleo-l452reNM_SERIAL=066AFF515055657867195125NM_UID=328c4b667b4689b077436c385fc55a66NM_PORT=/dev/ttyACM0NM_IDX=0───────────────────────────────────────$ printenv | grep NM_NM_BOARD=b-l072z-lrwan1NM_SERIAL=066CFF495351677867143305NM_UID=d1b3355a0e68fbf042a033ff3f222334NM_PORT=/dev/ttyACM3NM_IDX=1```6. While the terminal is still open, run another script.This will not use the boards that have been used for interactive session.```$ inet-nm-exec &quot;echo NM_BOARD=\$NM_BOARD&quot;NODE:0:BOARD:frdm-kw41z: NM_BOARD=frdm-kw41zNODE:1:BOARD:saml11-xpro: NM_BOARD=saml11-xproNODE:2:BOARD:remote-revb: NM_BOARD=remote-revbNODE:3:BOARD:esp32-wroom-32: NM_BOARD=esp32-wroom-32NODE:4:BOARD:b-l072z-lrwan1: NM_BOARD=b-l072z-lrwan1```## LicenseThis project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.
