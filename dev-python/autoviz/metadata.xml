Try it out and see the power of automated visualization for yourself!## Table of Contents- [Latest Updates for AutoViz](#Latest)- [The purpose and motivation for AutoViz](#motivation)- [How to install and setup AutoViz in your environment](#installation)- [How to use AutoViz with various options and settings](#usage)- [The API and available options](#api)- [Examples to get you started](#examples)- [Maintainers](#maintainers)- [Contributing to the project](#contributing)- [License](#license)- [Additional Tips before you start](#tips)- [Disclaimer](#disclaimer)## LatestThe latest updates about `autoviz` library can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AutoViML/AutoViz/blob/master/updates.md&quot;&gt;Updates page&lt;/a&gt;.## MotivationThe motivation behind the creation of AutoViz is to provide a more efficient, user-friendly, and automated approach to exploratory data analysis (EDA) through quick and easy data visualization plus data quality. The library is designed to help users understand patterns, trends, and relationships in the data by creating insightful visualizations with minimal effort. AutoViz is particularly useful for beginners in data analysis as it abstracts away the complexities of various plotting libraries and techniques. For experts, it provides another expert tool that they can use to provide inights into data that they may have missed.AutoViz is a powerful tool for generating insightful visualizations with minimal effort. Here are some of its key selling points compared to other automated EDA tools:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ease of use&lt;/b&gt;: AutoViz is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to beginners in data analysis, abstracting away the complexities of various plotting libraries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speed&lt;/b&gt;: AutoViz is optimized for speed and can generate multiple insightful plots with just a single line of code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scalability&lt;/b&gt;: AutoViz is designed to work with datasets of any size and can handle large datasets efficiently&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Automation&lt;/b&gt;: AutoViz automates the visualization process, requiring just a single line of code to generate multiple insightful plots&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customization&lt;/b&gt;: AutoViz provides several options for customizing the visualizations, such as changing the chart type, color palette, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data Quality&lt;/b&gt;: AutoViz now provides data quality assessment by default and helps you fix DQ issues with a single line of code using the FixDQ() function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;## Installation**Prerequisites**- [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)Create a new environment and install the required dependencies to clone AutoViz:**From PyPi:**```shcd &lt;AutoViz_Destination&gt;git clone git@github.com:AutoViML/AutoViz.git# or download and unzip https://github.com/AutoViML/AutoViz/archive/master.zipconda create -n &lt;your_env_name&gt; python=3.7 anacondaconda activate &lt;your_env_name&gt; # ON WINDOWS: `source activate &lt;your_env_name&gt;`cd AutoVizpip install -r requirements.txt```## UsageDiscover how to use AutoViz in this Medium article.In the AutoViz directory, open a Jupyter Notebook or open a command palette (terminal) and use the following code to instantiate the AutoViz_Class. You can simply run this code step by step:```pythonfrom autoviz import AutoViz_ClassAV = AutoViz_Class()dft = AV.AutoViz(filename)```AutoViz can use any input either filename (in CSV, txt, or JSON format) or a pandas dataframe. If you have a large dataset, you can set the `max_rows_analyzed` and `max_cols_analyzed` arguments to speed up the visualization by asking autoviz to sample your dataset.AutoViz can also create charts in multiple  formats using the `chart_format` setting:- If `chart_format ='png'` or `'svg'` or `'jpg'`: Matplotlib charts are plotted inline.    * Can be saved locally (using `verbose=2` setting) or displayed (`verbose=1`) in Jupyter Notebooks.    * This is the default behavior for AutoViz.- If `chart_format='bokeh'`: Interactive Bokeh charts are plotted in Jupyter Notebooks.- If `chart_format='server'`, dashboards will pop up for each kind of chart on your browser.- If `chart_format='html'`, interactive Bokeh charts will be created and silently saved as HTML files under the `AutoViz_Plots` directory (under working folder) or any other directory that you specify using the `save_plot_dir` setting (during input).## APIArguments for `AV.AutoViz()` method:- `filename`: Use an empty string (&quot;&quot;) if there's no associated filename and you want to use a dataframe. In that case, using the `dfte` argument for the dataframe. Otherwise provide a filename and leave `dfte` argument with an empty string. Only one of them can be used.- `sep`: File separator (comma, semi-colon, tab, or any column-separating value) if you use a filename above.- `depVar`: Target variable in your dataset; set it as an empty string if not applicable.- `dfte`: name of the pandas dataframe for plotting charts; leave it as empty string if using a filename.- `header`: set the row number of the header row in your file (0 for the first row). Otherwise leave it as 0.- `verbose`: 0 for minimal info and charts, 1 for more info and charts, or 2 for saving charts locally without display.- `lowess`: Use regression lines for each pair of continuous variables against the target variable in small datasets; avoid using for large datasets (&gt;100,000 rows).- `chart_format`: 'svg', 'png', 'jpg', 'bokeh', 'server', or 'html' for displaying or saving charts in various formats, depending on the verbose option.- `max_rows_analyzed`: Limit the max number of rows to use for visualization when dealing with very large datasets (millions of rows). A statistically valid sample will be used by autoviz. Default is 150000 rows.- `max_cols_analyzed`: Limit the number of continuous variables to be analyzed. Defaul is 30 columns.- `save_plot_dir`: Directory for saving plots. Default is None, which saves plots under the current directory in a subfolder named AutoViz_Plots. If the save_plot_dir doesn't exist, it will be created.## ExamplesHere are some examples to help you get started with AutoViz. If you need full jupyter notebooks with code samples they can be found in [examples](https://github.com/AutoViML/AutoViz/tree/master/Examples) folder.### Example 1: Visualize a CSV file with a target variable```pythonfrom autoviz import AutoViz_ClassAV = AutoViz_Class()filename = &quot;your_file.csv&quot;target_variable = &quot;your_target_variable&quot;dft = AV.AutoViz(    filename,    sep=&quot;,&quot;,    depVar=target_variable,    dfte=None,    header=0,    verbose=1,    lowess=False,    chart_format=&quot;svg&quot;,    max_rows_analyzed=150000,    max_cols_analyzed=30,    save_plot_dir=None)```![var_charts](images/var_charts.JPG)### Example 2: Visualize a Pandas DataFrame without a target variable:```pythonimport pandas as pdfrom autoviz import AutoViz_ClassAV = AutoViz_Class()data = {'col1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'col2': [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]}df = pd.DataFrame(data)dft = AV.AutoViz(    &quot;&quot;,    sep=&quot;,&quot;,    depVar=&quot;&quot;,    dfte=df,    header=0,    verbose=1,    lowess=False,    chart_format=&quot;server&quot;,    max_rows_analyzed=150000,    max_cols_analyzed=30,    save_plot_dir=None)```![server_charts](images/server_charts.JPG)### Example 3: Generate interactive Bokeh charts and save them as HTML files in a custom directory```pythonfrom autoviz import AutoViz_ClassAV = AutoViz_Class()filename = &quot;your_file.csv&quot;target_variable = &quot;your_target_variable&quot;custom_plot_dir = &quot;your_custom_plot_directory&quot;dft = AV.AutoViz(    filename,    sep=&quot;,&quot;,    depVar=target_variable,    dfte=None,    header=0,    verbose=2,    lowess=False,    chart_format=&quot;bokeh&quot;,    max_rows_analyzed=150000,    max_cols_analyzed=30,    save_plot_dir=custom_plot_dir)```![bokeh_charts](images/bokeh_charts.JPG)These examples should give you an idea of how to use AutoViz with different scenarios and settings. By tailoring the options and settings, you can generate visualizations that best suit your needs, whether you're working with large datasets, interactive charts, or simply exploring the relationships between variables.## MaintainersAutoViz is actively maintained and improved by a team of dedicated developers.
