	<longdescription>Created by `Stephen McDonald &lt;http://twitter.com/stephen_mcd&gt;`_Introduction============Do you have smaller Python projects that only need a README filefor documentation? Want to host your README on `Read The Docs`_?sphinx-me is a `BSD licensed`_ tool that will create a `Sphinx`_documentation shell for your project and include the README fileas the documentation index. It handles extracting the required metadata such as the project name, author and version from your projectfor use in your Sphinx docs.Once you use sphinx-me to build your Sphinx docs, you can thenadd your project to the Read The Docs site and have your project'sREADME hosted with an attractive Sphinx documentation theme... note::    Your README file should be in a `reStructuredText`_ compatible    format.Installation============The easiest way to install sphinx-me is directly from `PyPI`_ using`pip`_ or `setuptools`_ by running the respective command below::    $ pip install -U sphinx-meor::    $ easy_install -U sphinx-meOtherwise you can download sphinx-me and install it directlyfrom source::    $ python setup.py installRunning=======sphinx-me will be installed as a system-wide script that can be run fromthe command line while in your project's root directory::    $ sphinx-meWhen run in your project's directory, it will create a ``docs`` directorywith two files, the Sphinx ``conf.py`` module, and an ``index.rst`` filewhich will include your project's README.The ``conf.py`` module calls a setup function from sphinx-me that sets upthe minimum required settings for your Sphinx docs.  * ``project`` - the directory name of your project is used.  * ``version`` - retrieved from the ``version`` arg of your    ``setup.py`` script, or your package's ``__version__`` attribute.  * ``copyright`` - retrieved from the ``author`` arg of your    ``setup.py`` script, or your package's ``__author__`` attribute.Running this process will also perform an initial ``sphinx-build``inside your project's ``docs/build`` directory. Subsequent buildsafter making changes to your README can be performed by runningsphinx-me again, or by using the regular ``sphinx-build`` command.Hosting on Read The Docs========================When hosting your sphinx-me generated docs on `Read The Docs`_, youmust ensure you check the **Use virtualenv** option and specify``sphinx-me`` as a requirement in either your ``setup.py`` script,or in a `pip requirements file`_ that you'll need to also specify inthe **Requirements file** field for your project on Read The Docs... _`Read The Docs`: http://readthedocs.org/.. _`BSD licensed`: http://www.linfo.org/bsdlicense.html.. _`Sphinx`: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/.. _`reStructuredText`: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html.. _`PyPI`: http://pypi.python.org/.. _`setuptools`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools.. _`pip`: http://www.pip-installer.org/.. _`pip requirements file`: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/requirement-format.html</longdescription>
