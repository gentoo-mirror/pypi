	<longdescription># PyJAGS: The Python Interface to JAGSPyJAGS provides a Python interface to JAGS, a program for analysis of Bayesianhierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation.PyJAGS adds the following features on top of JAGS:* Multicore support for parallel simulation of multiple Markov chains (See Jupyter Notebook [Advanced Functionality](notebooks/Advanced%20Functionality.ipynb)* Saving sample MCMC chains to and restoring from HDF5 files* Functionality to merge samples along iterations or across chains so that sampling can be resumed in consecutive chunks until convergence criteria are satisfied* Connectivity to the Bayesian analysis and visualization package ArvizLicense: GPLv2## Supported PlatformsPyJAGS works on MacOS and Linux. Windows is not currently supported.## InstallationA working JAGS installation is required.&lt;pre&gt;    pip install pyjags&lt;/pre&gt;## Useful Links* Package on the Python Package Index &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyjags&gt;* Project page on github &lt;https://github.com/michaelnowotny/pyjags&gt;* JAGS manual and examples &lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/&gt;## Acknowledgements* JAGS was created by Martyn Plummer* PyJAGS was originally created by Tomasz Miasko* As of May 2020, PyJAGS is developed by Michael Nowotny</longdescription>
