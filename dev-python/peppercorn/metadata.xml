	<longdescription>Peppercorn==========A library for converting a token stream into a data structure comprised ofsequences, mappings, and scalars, developed primarily for converting HTTP formpost data into a richer data structure.  It runs on Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6and 3.7.Please see https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/peppercorn/en/latest/for the documentation.See https://github.com/Pylons/peppercorn for in-development version.Changes=======0.6 (2018-08-24)----------------- Add support for Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.- Drop support for Python 2.6, 3.2 and 3.3.- Add contributing.md and update docs. See  https://github.com/Pylons/peppercorn/issues/130.5 (2014-09-29)----------------- Switch to an iterative parser rather than a recursive parser to avoid  DoS attacks.- Add the ``ignore`` operation. The subsequent data elements in the stream  will be ignored until the corresponding ``__end__`` marker.  This feature  is useful for form elements designed for client-side scripting, such as a  &quot;select all&quot; checkbox in the middle of a list of other kinds of fields.- Add support for Python 3.3.- Drop support for Python 2.5 and Jython.0.4 (2012-02-14)----------------- Drop support for Python 2.4.- Add support for Python 3.2.- Move project to GitHub.- Switch to Pylons Project Sphinx theme.- Add tox configuration.0.3 (2010-09-02)----------------- 0.2 was a brownbag release. Handle the case where ``rename`` operation types  may not have children.0.2 (2010-09-02)----------------- Add new operation type: ``rename``.  ``rename`` begins a special mode.  The value of the first subsequent data element in the stream will be  used within its parent sequence or mapping. Any remaining data  elements until the corresponding ``__end__`` marker are ignored.  This is mostly in support of radio buttons.  See the ``rename`` docs  within `https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/peppercorn/en/latest/  &lt;https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/peppercorn/en/latest/&gt;`_ for more  information.0.1 (2010-03-23)----------------- Initial release.</longdescription>
