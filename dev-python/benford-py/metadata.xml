All of them, to a greater or lesser extent, followed such distribution.The extent of Benford's work seems to have been one good reason for the phenomenon to be popularized with his name, though described by Newcomb 57 years earlier.Derivations of the original formula were also applied in the expected findings of the proportions of digits in other positions in the number, as in the case of the second digit(BENFORD, 1938), as well as combinations, such as the first two digits of a number (NIGRINI, 2012, p.5).Only in 1995, however, was the phenomenon proven by Hill. His proof was based on the fact that numbers in data seriesfollowing the Benford Law are, in effect, &quot;second generation&quot;distributions, ie combinations of other distributions.The union of randomly drawn samples from various distributionsforms a distribution that respects Benford's Law (HILL, 1995).When grouped in ascending order, data that obey Benford's Law must approximate a geometric sequence (NIGRINI, 2012, page 21).From this it follows that the logarithms of this ordered seriesmust form a straight line. In addition, the mantissas (decimalparts) of the logarithms of these numbers must be uniformlydistributed in the interval [0,1] (NIGRINI, 2012, p.10).In general, a series of numerical records follows Benford's Lawwhen (NIGRINI, 2012, p.21):* it represents magnitudes of events or events, such as populationsof cities, flows of water in rivers or sizes of celestial bodies;* it does not have pre-established minimum or maximum limits;* it is not made up of numbers used as identifiers, such as identity or social security numbers, bank accounts, telephone numbers; and* its mean is less than the median, and the data is notconcentrated around the mean.It follows from this expected distribution that, if the set ofnumbers in a series of records that usually respects the Lawshows a deviation in the proportions found, there may bedistortions, whether intentional or not.Benford's Law has been used in [several fields](http://www.benfordonline.net/). Afer asserting that the usual data type is Benford-compliant,one can study samples from the same data type tin search ofinconsistencies, errors or even [fraud](https://www.amazon.com.br/Benfords-Law-Applications-Accounting-Detection/dp/1118152859).This open source module is an attempt to facilitate the performance of Benford's Law-related tests by people usingPython, whether interactively or in an automated, scripting way.It uses the versatility of numpy and pandas, along withmatplotlib for vizualization, to deliver results like [this one](https://github.com/milcent/benford_py/blob/master/img/SPY-f2d-conf_level-95.png) and much more.It has been a long time since I last tested it in Python 2. The death clock has stopped ticking, so officially it is for Python 3 now. It should work on Linux, Windows and Mac, but please file a bug report if you run into some trouble.Also, if you have some nice data set that we can run these tests on, let'us try it.Thanks!Milcent</longdescription>
