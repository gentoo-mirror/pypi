	<longdescription>stickytape: Convert Python packages into a single script========================================================Stickytape can be used to convert a Python script and any Python modulesit depends on into a single-file Python script.Since this relies on correctly analysing both your script and any dependent modules,this may not work correctly in all circumstances.I bodged together the code a long time ago for a specific use case I had,so many normal uses of Python imports are not properly supported.If you need to create a standalone executable from your Python script,I recommend using an alternative such as `PyInstaller &lt;http://www.pyinstaller.org/&gt;`_.Installation------------::    pip install stickytapeUsage-----You can tell stickytape which directories to search using the ``--add-python-path`` argument.For instance:.. code:: sh    stickytape scripts/blah --add-python-path . &gt; /tmp/blah-standaloneOr to output directly to a file:.. code:: sh    stickytape scripts/blah --add-python-path . --output-file /tmp/blah-standaloneYou can also point stickytape towards a Python binary that it should usesys.path from, for instance the Python binary inside a virtualenv:.. code:: sh    stickytape scripts/blah --python-binary _virtualenv/bin/python --output-file /tmp/blah-standaloneStickytape cannot automatically detect dynamic imports,but you can use ``--add-python-module`` to explicitly include modules:.. code:: sh    stickytape scripts/blah --add-python-module blah.utilBy default, stickytape will ignore the shebang in the scriptand use ``&quot;#!/usr/bin/env python&quot;`` in the output file.To copy the shebang from the original script,use ``--copy-shebang``:.. code:: sh    stickytape scripts/blah --copy-shebang --output-file /tmp/blah-standaloneAs you might expect with a program that munges source files, there are afew caveats:-  Due to the way that stickytape generates the output file, your script   source file should be encoded using UTF-8. If your script doesn't declare   its encoding in its first two lines, then it will be UTF-8 by default   as of Python 3.-  Your script shouldn't have any ``from __future__`` imports.-  Anything that relies on the specific location of files will probably   no longer work. In other words, ``__file__`` probably isn't all that   useful.-  Any files that aren't imported won't be included. Static data that   might be part of your project, such as other text files or images,   won't be included.</longdescription>
