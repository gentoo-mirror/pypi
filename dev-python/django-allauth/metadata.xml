Most developers end up integrating another app in order to support authentication flows that are locally generated. This approach creates a development gap between local and socialauthentication flows. It has remained an issue in spite of numerous common scenarios that both require. For example, an e-mail address passed along by anOpenID provider may not be verified. Therefore, prior to hooking upan OpenID account to a local account the e-mail address must beverified. This essentially is one of many use cases that mandate e-mail verification to be present in both worlds.Integrating both is a humongous and tedious process. It is not assimple as adding one social authentication app, and onelocal account registration app to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list.This inadequacy is the reason for this project's existence  -- to offer a fullyintegrated authentication app that allows for both local and socialauthentication, with flows that just work, beautifully !Commercial Support==================This project is sponsored by IntenCT_.
