(Will problably break with every API change.)- Use a headless JS browser with Selenium. (Resource-heavy, not really cross-platform.)- Run a JS engine like PyMiniRacer/PyQt5. (Better speed, but needs C extensions.)So I decided to roll with the IPNS dataset.## takedown request, et tuTake a look at this [issue](https://github.com/Xmader/musescore-downloader/issues/5) in the same repo.## HackingAll my python projects now use [flit](https://pypi.org/project/flit) to build and publish.So you need to `python3 -m pip install flit` first.```textflit build```## Install`(python3 -m) pip install musdl`Optionally, to export the score in other formats (midi, mp3, etc.) install musescore.musdl relies on its command-line tool `mscore` to export scores:```text# Linuxsudo (package manager/snap) install musescore# Windowsscoop bucket add extras  # add the extras bucket if you haven'tscoop install musescore```## LicenseMIT.</longdescription>
