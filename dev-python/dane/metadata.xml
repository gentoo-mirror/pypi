	<longdescription># DANEThe Distributed Annotation 'n' Enrichment (DANE) system handles compute task assignment and file storage for the automatic annotation of content.This repository contains contains the building blocks for with DANE, such as creating custom analysis workers or submitting new task.## InstallationThis package can be installed through pip:    pip install dane### ConfigurationDANE components are configured through the dane.config module, which is described here: https://dane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#configuration It is however noteable that, because all DANE components are expected to rely on it, some of the DANE-server, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ configuration are included in the default config. As such it is recommended that you create a `$HOME/.dane/config.yml` or `$DANE_HOME/config.yml` which contain machine-wide settings for how to connect to these services, which involves specifying the following settings:```DANE:    API_URL: 'http://localhost:5500/DANE/'    MANAGE_URL: 'http://localhost:5500/manage/'RABBITMQ:    HOST: 'localhost'    PORT: 5672    EXCHANGE: 'DANE-exchange'    RESPONSE_QUEUE: 'DANE-response-queue'    USER: 'guest'    PASSWORD: 'guest'ELASTICSEARCH:    HOST: ['localhost']    PORT: 9200    USER: 'elastic'    PASSWORD: 'changeme'    SCHEME: 'http'    INDEX: 'your_dane_index'```The values given here are the default values.### UsageExamples of how to use DANE can be found in the `examples/` directory.## Local DevelopmentWe moved from `setup.py` &amp; `requirements.txt` to a single `pyproject.toml`. For local builds and publishing we use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).For local installation:```bashpoetry installpoetry shell```After installation the following unit test should succeed:```bashpython -m test.test_dane```To build a wheel + source package (will end up in `dist` directory):```bashpoetry build```The wheel can be conveniently tested in e.g. your own DANE worker by installing it e.g. using `pip`:```bashpip install path_to_dane_wheel_file```or with poetry```bashpoetry add path_to_dane_wheel_file```### Breaking changes after 0.3.1 Since version 0.3.1 DANE must be imported in lowercase letters:```pythonimport dane```Before version 0.3.1 you should import using uppercase letters:```pythonimport DANE```</longdescription>
