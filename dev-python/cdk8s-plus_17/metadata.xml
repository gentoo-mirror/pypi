	<longdescription># cdk8s+ (cdk8s-plus)&gt; ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/experimental-important.svg?style=for-the-badge)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; This library is in very early stages of development, as such, and in correspondence with a `0.x` semantic major version line, its `API` is&gt; likely to rapidly change in breaking ways. It is therefore not recommended to use library for production workloads.**cdk8s+** is a software development framework that provides high level abstractions for authoring Kubernetes applications.Built on top of the auto generated building blocks provided by [cdk8s](../cdk8s), this library includes a hand crafted *construct*for each native kubernetes object, exposing richer API's with reduced complexity.## DocumentationSee [cdk8s.io](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/plus).## LicenseThis project is distributed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](./LICENSE).This module is part of the [cdk8s project](https://github.com/awslabs/cdk8s).</longdescription>
