But aswe all know, prototypes make it into production all the time, so nowyou're stuck. Unfortunately, there are no style checkers or &quot;good&quot;static analysis tools for MATLAB. This project attempts to fill thisgap.If you have MATLAB (or MATLAB embedded in Simulink models) in yourproduction code and want to improve code quality then this tool-suiteis for you.## Tools &amp; DocumentationMISS_HIT comes with the following tools, all of which come with usermanuals and setup instructions:https://florianschanda.github.io/miss_hit/* Style Checker `mh_style`  A simple coding style checker and code formatter for MATLAB or  Octave code, including MATLAB embedded inside Simulink models.* Code Metrics `mh_metric`  A simple code metric tool for MATLAB or Octave code, including  MATLAB embedded inside Simulink models.* Bug finding `mh_lint`  A simple linter for MATLAB or Octave code, including  MATLAB embedded inside Simulink models.* Code/Test traceability `mh_trace`  A simple tool to extrace tags from test and code to demonstrate  requirements traceability.* Diff helper `mh_diff`  A tool for diffing MATLAB code inside Simulink models. Note that  other changes (e.g. different connections) are not detected; this is  only working for embedded MATLAB.* Copyright notice helper `mh_copyright`  A tool that can update or adjust copyright notices in bulk. Helpful  if your company changes name, or you have year ranges that need  updating.Please refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/florianschanda/miss_hit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)for a summary of recent changes and known issues.We intend to provide more tools later, please refer to the[roadmap](https://github.com/florianschanda/miss_hit/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)for more information.## Installing and using MISS_HIT### Installation via pip```$ pip3 install --user miss_hit```This installation also adds five executable scripts `mh_style`,`mh_metric`, `mh_lint`, `mh_copyright`, and `mh_diff` into`.local/bin`, so please make sure that this is on your `PATH`.You can also use the `python -m` syntax to directly invoke theprogram. This might be useful if you're on a heavily locked-downcorporate Windows environment:```$ python3 -m miss_hit.mh_style```To use MISS_HIT you just give it a set of files or directories toprocess, for example:```$ mh_style my_file.m$ mh_style --process-slx my_model.slx$ mh_style src/```Configuration and setup is described in the[user manuals](https://florianschanda.github.io/miss_hit)### Installation by checkoutIt is recommended to use pip, as that gets you the latest stablerelease. However, it is possible to directly use MISS_HIT from acheckout.  MISS_HIT does not require *any* python packages orlibraries. Just check out the repository and put it on yourpath. That's it.The version of Python I am using is `3.6` but any later version shouldalso work. I am not using any overly fancy language features.### Additional requirements for developing MISS_HITIf you want to help develop you will need Linux as the test-suitedoesn't really work on Windows. You will also need Pylint,PyCodeStyle, Coverage, and Graphviz. Install as follows:```$ apt-get install graphviz$ pip3 install --user --upgrade pylint pycodestyle coverage```For publishing releases (to GitHub and PyPI) you will also need:```$ pip3 install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel requests```## ChallengesThere are serious issues present in the MATLAB and Octave languages onall levels (lexical structure, parsing, and semantics) that make itvery difficult to create any tool processing them. In fact, GitHub islittered with incomplete attempts and buggy parsers. The usualquestion is &quot;but what about Octave?&quot;; it is a similar language, but itis not compatible with MATLAB. If your problem is parsing MATLAB thenthe Octave parser will not help you. Even very simple statements suchas `x = [1++2]` mean different things (`3` in MATLAB, syntax error inOctave).I have [documented the keyissues](https://github.com/florianschanda/miss_hit/blob/master/CHALLENGES.md)we've faced and how we've resolved them.## Copyright &amp; LicenseThe basic framework, style checker and code metrics tool of MISS_HIT(everything under `miss_hit_core`) are licensed under the GNU GPLversion 3 (or later) as described in[LICENSE](https://github.com/florianschanda/miss_hit/blob/master/LICENSE).The advanced analysis tools of MISS_HIT (everything under `miss_hit`)are licensed under the GNU Affero GPL version 3 (or later) asdescribed in[LICENSE.AGPL](https://github.com/florianschanda/miss_hit/blob/master/LICENSE.AGPL).The vast majority of this work is (C) Florian Schanda.
