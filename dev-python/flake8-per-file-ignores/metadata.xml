	<longdescription># flake8-per-file-ignores[![Build Status][1]][2][![Pypi Entry][3]][4]**This flake8 extension has been discontinued in favour of the`per-file-ignores` option built into flake8 3.7.0 and above.But be aware that the built-in option uses different syntax.**An extension for [flake8][5] that lets you configure (out-of-source) individualerror codes to be ignored per file.This is mostly useful when dealing with legacy code, so that you don't have toignore any existing error globally, but get the benefits of all checks in newfiles, while you avoid introducing new kind of errors in existing files.The advantage over inline `# noqa` comments is, that it doesn't clutter yoursource files or even requires touching them.## Installation    pip install flake8-per-file-ignores## ConfigurationYou can can use following configuration syntax in any [configuration fileconsidered by flake8][6]:    [flake8]    per-file-ignores =      &lt;filename&gt;: &lt;error&gt;[,&lt;error&gt;[,...]]      [...]* `filename` is the filename, or if starting with a slash, the full path  relative to the directory flake8 is running from, of the script that is  subject to the ignores. It can also be a glob pattern, but note (just like  with the `glob` module or in UNIX shells), `*` doesn't match accross  directory boundaries, however, you can use `**` in order to match recursively.* `error` has the same semantics as the [`--ignore` command line option][7].If an ignored error no longer occurs for a given file it will trigger an `X100`error to make you progressively reduce the number of ignores as legacy codegets rewritten or removed.For an example see the [`test` folder][8].[1]: https://travis-ci.org/snoack/flake8-per-file-ignores.svg?branch=master[2]: https://travis-ci.org/snoack/flake8-per-file-ignores[3]: https://badge.fury.io/py/flake8-per-file-ignores.svg[4]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8-per-file-ignores[5]: https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8[6]: http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html#configuration-locations[7]: http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/options.html#cmdoption-flake8-ignore[8]: https://github.com/snoack/flake8-per-file-ignores/tree/master/test</longdescription>
