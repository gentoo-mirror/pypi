Check the [announcement blog post](https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/cloud-masks-at-your-service-6e5b2cb2ce8a) and [technical documentation](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/#/API/data_access?id=cloud-masks-and-cloud-probabilities).**The **s2cloudless** Python package provides automated cloud detection inSentinel-2 imagery. The classification is based on a *single-scene pixel-based cloud detector*developed by Sentinel Hub's research team and is described in more detail[in this blog](https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/improving-cloud-detection-with-machine-learning-c09dc5d7cf13).The **s2cloudless** algorithm was part of an international collaborative effort aimed at intercomparing cloud detection algorithms. The s2cloudless algorithm was validated together with 9 other algorithms on 4 different test datasets and in all cases found to be on the Pareto front. See [the paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425722001043?via%3Dihub)## InstallationThe package requires a Python version &gt;= 3.7. The package is available onthe PyPI package manager and can be installed with```$ pip install s2cloudless```To install the package manually, clone the repository and```$ pip install .```One of `s2cloudless` dependencies is `lightgbm` package. If having problems during installation, pleasecheck the [LightGBM installation guide](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation-Guide.html).Before installing `s2cloudless` on **Windows**, it is recommended to install package `shapely` from[Unofficial Windows wheels repository](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)## Input: Sentinel-2 scenesThe inputs to the cloud detector are Sentinel-2 images. In particular, the cloud detector requires the following 10 Sentinel-2 band reflectances: B01, B02, B04, B05, B08, B8A, B09, B10, B11, B12, which are obtained from raw reflectance values in the following way: `B_i/10000`. From product baseline `04.00` onward additional harmonization factors have to be applied to data according to [instructions from ESA](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/en/web/sentinel/-/copernicus-sentinel-2-major-products-upgrade-upcoming).You don't need to worry about any of this, if you are using Sentinel-2 data obtained from [Sentinel Hub Process API](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/api/process/). By default, the data is already harmonized according to [documentation](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/data/sentinel-2-l1c/#harmonize-values). The API is supported in Python with [sentinelhub-py](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinelhub-py) package and used within `s2cloudless.CloudMaskRequest` class.## ExamplesA Jupyter notebook on how to use the cloud detector to produce cloud mask or cloud probability mapcan be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinel2-cloud-detector/tree/master/examples).## License&lt;a rel=&quot;license&quot; href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Creative Commons License&quot; style=&quot;border-width:0&quot; src=&quot;https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This work is licensed under a &lt;a rel=&quot;license&quot; href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License&lt;/a&gt;.</longdescription>
