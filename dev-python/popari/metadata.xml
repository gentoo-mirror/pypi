	<longdescription># SpiceMix![overview](./SpiceMix_overview.png)SpiceMix is an unsupervised tool for analyzing data of the spatial transcriptome. SpiceMix models the observed expression of genes within a cell as a mixture of latent factors. These factors are assumed to have some spatial affinity between neighboring cells. The factors and affinities are not known a priori, but are learned by SpiceMix directly from the data, by an alternating optimization method that seeks to maximize their posterior probability given the observed gene expression. In this way, SpiceMix learns a more expressive representation of the identity of cells from their spatial transcriptome data than other available methods. SpiceMix can be applied to any type of spatial transcriptomics data, including MERFISH, seqFISH, HDST, and Slide-seq.## Install```pip install popari```## Publishing```pip install hatchpip install keyrings.althatch buildhatch publish```Username: `__token__`Password: `{API token for PyPI}`## TestsTo run the provided tests and ensure that SpiceMix can run on your platform, follow the instructions below:- Download this repo.```consolegit clone https://github.com/alam-shahul/SpiceMixPlus.git```- Install `pytest` in your environment.```consolepip install pytest```- Navigate to the root directory of this repo.- Run the following command.
