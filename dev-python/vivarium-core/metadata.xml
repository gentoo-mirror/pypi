We need an &quot;interface protocol&quot; -- analogous to TCP/IP for the Internet -- which allows diverse pieces of simulation software to connect, communicate, and synchronize seamlessly into large, complex, and open-ended networks that anyone can contribute to.Vivarium addresses the challenges of model reuse and multi-scale integration by explicitly separating the interface that connects models from the frameworks that implement them. Vivarium's modular interface makes individual simulation tools into modules that can be wired together in composite multi-scale models, parallelized across multiple CPUs, and run with Vivarium's discrete-event simulation engine.The figure below illustrates the key terminology of Vivarium's interface.* (**a**) A *Process*, shown as a rectangular flowchart symbol, is a modular model that contains parameters, an update function, and ports.* (**b**) A *Store*, shown as the flowchart symbol for a database, holds the state variables and schemas that determine how to handle updates. * (**c**) *Composites* are bundles of Processes and Stores wired together by a bipartite network called a *Topology*, with Processes connecting to Stores through their ports. * (**d**) *Compartments* are Stores with inner sub-Stores and Processes. Processes can connect across compartments via boundary stores.* (**e**) Compartments are embedded in a *Hierarchy* -- depicted as a place network with discrete layers, with outer compartments shown above and inner compartments below.&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;    &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/vivarium-collective/vivarium-core/blob/master/doc/_static/interface.png?raw=true&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;## LicenseCopyright (C) 2019-2022 The Vivarium AuthorsLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;); you maynot use this project except in compliance with the License.
