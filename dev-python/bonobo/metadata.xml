Please allow us to reach 1.0 stability and our sincere apologies for anything we break in the process (feel free to complain on issues, allowing us to correct breakages we did not expect)*----Homepage: https://www.bonobo-project.org/ (`Roadmap &lt;https://www.bonobo-project.org/roadmap&gt;`_)Documentation: http://docs.bonobo-project.org/Contributing guide: http://docs.bonobo-project.org/en/latest/contribute/index.htmlIssues: https://github.com/python-bonobo/bonobo/issuesSlack: https://bonobo-slack.herokuapp.com/Release announcements: http://eepurl.com/csHFKL----Made with ‚ô• by `Romain Dorgueil &lt;https://twitter.com/rdorgueil&gt;`_ and `contributors &lt;https://github.com/python-bonobo/bonobo/graphs/contributors&gt;`_... image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/bonobo.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bonobo    :alt: License</longdescription>
