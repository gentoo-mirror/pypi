These data types are also the lingua francaof most data serialization libraries, for formats like json, msgpack, yaml ortoml.Data types like this, and mappings like ``dict`` s in particular, representunstructured data. Your data is, in all likelihood, structured: not allcombinations of field names or values are valid inputs to your programs. InPython, structured data is better represented with classes and enumerations.``attrs`` is an excellent library for declaratively describing the structure ofyour data, and validating it.When you're handed unstructured data (by your network, file system, database...),``cattrs`` helps to convert this data into structured data. When you have toconvert your structured data into data types other libraries can handle,``cattrs`` turns your classes and enumerations into dictionaries, integers andstrings.Here's a simple taste. The list containing a float, an int and a stringgets converted into a tuple of three ints... code-block:: pycon    &gt;&gt;&gt; import cattrs    &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; cattrs.structure([1.0, 2, &quot;3&quot;], tuple[int, int, int])    (1, 2, 3)``cattrs`` works well with ``attrs`` classes out of the box... code-block:: pycon    &gt;&gt;&gt; from attrs import frozen    &gt;&gt;&gt; import cattrs    &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; @frozen  # It works with non-frozen classes too.    ... class C:    ...     a: int    ...     b: str    ...    &gt;&gt;&gt; instance = C(1, 'a')    &gt;&gt;&gt; cattrs.unstructure(instance)    {'a': 1, 'b': 'a'}    &gt;&gt;&gt; cattrs.structure({'a': 1, 'b': 'a'}, C)    C(a=1, b='a')Here's a much more complex example, involving ``attrs`` classes with typemetadata... code-block:: pycon    &gt;&gt;&gt; from enum import unique, Enum    &gt;&gt;&gt; from typing import Optional, Sequence, Union    &gt;&gt;&gt; from cattrs import structure, unstructure    &gt;&gt;&gt; from attrs import define, field    &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; @unique    ... class CatBreed(Enum):    ...     SIAMESE = &quot;siamese&quot;    ...     MAINE_COON = &quot;maine_coon&quot;    ...     SACRED_BIRMAN = &quot;birman&quot;    ...    &gt;&gt;&gt; @define    ... class Cat:    ...     breed: CatBreed    ...     names: Sequence[str]    ...    &gt;&gt;&gt; @define    ... class DogMicrochip:    ...     chip_id = field()  # Type annotations are optional, but recommended    ...     time_chipped: float = field()    ...    &gt;&gt;&gt; @define    ... class Dog:    ...     cuteness: int    ...     chip: Optional[DogMicrochip] = None    ...    &gt;&gt;&gt; p = unstructure([Dog(cuteness=1, chip=DogMicrochip(chip_id=1, time_chipped=10.0)),    ...                  Cat(breed=CatBreed.MAINE_COON, names=('Fluffly', 'Fluffer'))])    ...    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(p)    [{'cuteness': 1, 'chip': {'chip_id': 1, 'time_chipped': 10.0}}, {'breed': 'maine_coon', 'names': ('Fluffly', 'Fluffer')}]    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(structure(p, list[Union[Dog, Cat]]))    [Dog(cuteness=1, chip=DogMicrochip(chip_id=1, time_chipped=10.0)), Cat(breed=&lt;CatBreed.MAINE_COON: 'maine_coon'&gt;, names=['Fluffly', 'Fluffer'])]Consider unstructured data a low-level representation that needs to be convertedto structured data to be handled, and use ``structure``. When you're done,``unstructure`` the data to its unstructured form and pass it along to anotherlibrary or module. Use `attrs type metadata &lt;http://attrs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#types&gt;`_to add type metadata to attributes, so ``cattrs`` will know how to structure anddestructure them.* Free software: MIT license* Documentation: https://cattrs.readthedocs.io.* Python versions supported: 3.7 and up. (Older Python versions, like 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6 are supported by older versions; see the changelog.)Features--------* Converts structured data into unstructured data, recursively:  * ``attrs`` classes and dataclasses are converted into dictionaries in a way similar to ``attrs.asdict``, or into tuples in a way similar to ``attrs.astuple``.  * Enumeration instances are converted to their values.  * Other types are let through without conversion. This includes types such as    integers, dictionaries, lists and instances of non-``attrs`` classes.  * Custom converters for any type can be registered using ``register_unstructure_hook``.* Converts unstructured data into structured data, recursively, according to  your specification given as a type. The following types are supported:  * ``typing.Optional[T]``.  * ``typing.List[T]``, ``typing.MutableSequence[T]``, ``typing.Sequence[T]`` (converts to a list).  * ``typing.Tuple`` (both variants, ``Tuple[T, ...]`` and ``Tuple[X, Y, Z]``).  * ``typing.MutableSet[T]``, ``typing.Set[T]`` (converts to a set).  * ``typing.FrozenSet[T]`` (converts to a frozenset).  * ``typing.Dict[K, V]``, ``typing.MutableMapping[K, V]``, ``typing.Mapping[K, V]`` (converts to a dict).  * ``attrs`` classes with simple attributes and the usual ``__init__``.    * Simple attributes are attributes that can be assigned unstructured data,      like numbers, strings, and collections of unstructured data.  * All `attrs` classes and dataclasses with the usual ``__init__``, if their complex attributes have type metadata.  * ``typing.Union`` s of supported ``attrs`` classes, given that all of the classes have a unique field.  * ``typing.Union`` s of anything, given that you provide a disambiguation function for it.  * Custom converters for any type can be registered using ``register_structure_hook``.``cattrs`` comes with preconfigured converters for a number of serialization libraries, including json, msgpack, bson, yaml and toml.For details, see the `cattr.preconf package &lt;https://cattrs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/preconf.html&gt;`_.Additional documentation------------------------* `On structured and unstructured data, or the case for cattrs &lt;https://threeofwands.com/on-structured-and-unstructured-data-or-the-case-for-cattrs/&gt;`_* `Why I use attrs instead of pydantic &lt;https://threeofwands.com/why-i-use-attrs-instead-of-pydantic/&gt;`_* `cattrs I: un/structuring speed &lt;https://threeofwands.com/why-cattrs-is-so-fast/&gt;`_Credits-------Major credits to Hynek Schlawack for creating attrs_ and its predecessor,characteristic_.``cattrs`` is tested with Hypothesis_, by David R.
