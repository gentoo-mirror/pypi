It extends the Squirrel platform for data transform, access, and discovery through custom drivers for public datasets. 2. It also allows you to tap into the vast amounts of open-source datasets from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/), [Activeloop Hub](https://www.activeloop.ai/) and [Torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html), and you'll get all of Squirrel's functionality on top!3. It provides open-source and community-contributed [tutorials and example notebooks](https://github.com/merantix-momentum/squirrel-datasets-core/tree/main/examples) for using Squirrel.## ContributingSquirrel is open source and community contributions are welcome!Check out the [contribution guide](https://squirrel-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/contribute.html) to learn how to get involved.## The Humans Behind SquirrelWe are [Merantix Momentum](https://merantix-momentum.com/), a team of ~30 machine learning engineers, developing machine learning solutions for industry and research. Each project comes with its own challenges, data types and learnings, but one issue we always faced was scalable data loading, transforming and sharing. We were looking for a solution that would allow us to load the data in a fast and cost-efficient way, while keeping the flexibility to work with any possible dataset and integrate with any API. That's why we build Squirrel â€“ and we hope you'll find it as useful as we do! By the way, [we are hiring](https://merantix-momentum.com/about#jobs)!## CitationIf you use Squirrel in your research, please cite it using:```bibtex@article{2022squirrelcore,  title={Squirrel: A Python library that enables ML teams to share, load, and transform data in a collaborative, flexible, and efficient way.},  author={Squirrel Developer Team},  journal={GitHub.
