	<longdescription>Invectio--------A simple tool to gather symbols provided or library calls and attribute usagebased on static analysis of sources of Python applications.See [the linked article describing thistool](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/01/05/extracting-information-python-source-code).Installation============Invectio can be installed from `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/invectio&gt;`_ using:.. code-block:: console  $ pip3 install invectio  $ invectio --helpUsage=====You can use this library as a CLI tool or as a Python module:.. code-block:: console  invectio whatprovides project-dir/   # To scan all Python files recursively for symbols provided.  invectio whatprovides app.py         # To perform symbols gathering on app.py file.  invectio whatuses project-dir/       # To scan all Python files recursively for symbols used from libraries.  invectio whatuses app.py             # To perform gather symbols used from libraries on app.py file... code-block:: python  from invectio import gather_library_calls  from invectio import gather_symbols_provided  result: dict = gather_library_usage(&quot;project-dir&quot;)  result: dict = gather_library_usage(&quot;app.py&quot;)  result: dict = gather_symbols_provided(&quot;project-dir&quot;)  result: dict = gather_symbols_provided(&quot;app.py&quot;)Limitations###########As Python is a dynamic programming language, it's not possible to obtain alllibrary functions/attributes usage simply by performing static analysis ofsources. One can still perfom &quot;crazy&quot; things like:.. code-block:: python  import tensorflow  getattr(tensorflow, &quot;const&quot; + &quot;ant&quot;)(&quot;Hello, Invectio&quot;)This library does its best to detect all function/attributes being used insidePython sources, but usage like shown above cannot be detected simply by staticanalysis of source code.Development===========To create a dev environment, clone the invectio repo and install all the dependencies:.. code-block:: console  git clone https://github.com/thoth-station/invectio &amp;&amp; cd invectio  pipenv install --devTo perform checks against unit tests present in the `tests/` directory,issue the following command from the root of the git repo:.. code-block:: console  pipenv run python3 setup.py test</longdescription>
