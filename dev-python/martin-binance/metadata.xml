After each grid order executed, the price of the take profit order (TP)approaches the price of the grid, which requires less bounce to perform it.If all grid orders filled, then reverse and start the cycle in another direction.The price overlap set for the reverse cycle grid provides a given profit for the initiating cycle.For Reverse cycle there are only two possible result depending on the price in the market.In the first case the entire grid executed therefore we close the previous cycle with profit.In second case executing part of the grid orders, and the filling take profit order increase the depo in the second coin.It reduces the necessary price overlap and sooner or later first variant comes true.This allows you to increase the initial deposit using price fluctuations in any trend,and makes this strategy really break even. Unless you trade scam shitcoin.In the cycle to sell, the profit accumulates in the first currency.In the cycle to buy, the profit accumulates in the second coin.Fee payments are taken into account when calculating TP.The optimal pair choice is a stable coin or fiat plus a coin from the top ten.## Features&lt;p id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;* &lt;a href=&quot;#assets-management&quot;&gt;Assets management&lt;/a&gt; capabilities added from 1.2.10 (for STANDALONE mode)* From 1.2.9-8 you can withdraw and deposit assets on active strategy with autocorrection depo and initial assetscontrol values* Create grid and take profit orders* Logarithm price option for grid orders (customizable)* Reverse algo if all grid orders are filling* Calculation of the price overlap for the Reverse cycle for the profitable completion of the previous cycle* Use Average Directional Index indicator for best time starting Reverse cycle* Calculation of separate MAKER and TAKER fee* Shift grid orders (customizable) if the price is go way (before take profit placed)* Adapted size of the first order depending on the exchange's limitations* Fractional creation of grid for increase productivity (customizable)* Adaptive overlap price for grid on current market conditions (customizable) based on Bollinger Band* Update grid orders if market conditions change* Adaptive profit setting on current market conditions (customizable) based on Bollinger Band* Adaptive grid orders quantity for initial and Reverse cycle* Stable operation in pump/dump conditions* Process partial execution of orders with large amounts of funds* Save funding change, cycle parameter and result in sqlite3 .db for external analytics* Telegram notification* External control from Telegram bot* Restore state after restart strategy## Quick start&lt;p id=&quot;quick-start&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;For *STANDALONE* mode you can use both - pip and Docker deployment schemas, as you choice.For *margin* mode - pip only.For test purpose in *STANDALONE* mode create API key pair:* Log in at [Binance Spot Test Network](https://testnet.binance.vision/)* Create API Key*You can test strategy on Binance, OKX and Bitfinex exchanges, where realized &quot;paper trade mode&quot;*#### Create Telegram bot* Register [Telegram bot](https://t.me/BotFather)* Get token* Find channel_id.

Specify the trade direction for the first cycle.If START_ON_BUY = True, a grid of buy orders will be placed and take profit will be for sale.Specify the deposit size for the first cycle in the desired currency, and the number of grid orders.These are related parameters, there is a limit on the minimum size of the order,so a many orders if the deposit is insufficient will not pass the verification during initialization.The size of the order in the grid calculated according to the law of geometric progression,while the MARTIN parameter is a coefficient of progression.The first order, the price of which is closest to the current one is the smallest in volume.To avoid the execution of the first order &quot;by market&quot; its price set with a slight offset,which is determined by the parameter PRICE_SHIFT.#### Shift grid orders&lt;p id=&quot;shift-grid-orders&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;It happens that when place a grid, the price goes in the opposite direction. There is no pointin waiting in this case, we need to move the grid after the price.For this there are SHIFT_GRID_DELAY. Configure them or leave the default values.#### Adaptive overlap price for grid&lt;p id=&quot;adaptive-overlap-price-for-grid&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The range of prices that overlaps the grid of orders affects profitability directly and must correspond to market conditions. If it is too wide combined with small number of orders,the cycle time will be too long, and most of the deposit will not be involved in turnover.With a small overlap, the entire order grid will be executed in a short time, and the algorithm will be reversed,while the profit on the cycle not fixed.The overlap range can be fixed. Then it is defined by OVER_PRICE = xx and ADAPTIVE_TRADE_CONDITION = False.For automatic market adjustment, ADAPTIVE_TRADE_CONDITION = True. In this case, the instant valueof the Bollinger Band on 20 * 1 hour candles used to calculate the overlap range. The minimum valuesare limited by the exchange limit for minimal price change per one step combined with number of orders.For fine-tuning there is KBB parameter. By default, value 2.0 is used to calculate Bollinger curves.The over price value update before the start of the new cycle and periodically refreshed.If the market condition change exceeds the set limits, the grid is updated (does not apply in reverse cycle).#### Quantity of grid orders&lt;p id=&quot;quantity-of-grid-orders&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Two parameters determine the number of orders, ORDER_Q and OVER_PRICE. For start cycle and parameterADAPTIVE_TRADE_CONDITION = False, these are absolute and fixed values.For Reverse cycle or parameter ADAPTIVE_TRADE_CONDITION = True they specify the density of grid orders.At the same time, the larger the range of overlap, the more orders there will be.When calculating, the exchange's restrictions on the minimum order size and price step taken into accountand thus limit the maximum number of orders.For Reverse cycle, this is especially important, since with large price fluctuations we will have to sweepa very large range, 30-50% or more. In which case an adaptive number of orders will allow to do this as efficientlyas possible.#### Fractional creation of grid&lt;p id=&quot;fractional-creation-of-grid&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;For successful trading, the speed of the bot response to price fluctuations is important.When testing on Bitfinex, I noticed that when placed a group of orders,the first 5 are placed quickly, and the remaining ones with a significant delay. Also, the more orders,the longer it takes to shift the grid.Therefore, I added the parameter GRID_MAX_COUNT, which specifies the number of initial orders to be placed.Then, two options performed. First, the grid shift function triggered. Second, one of the placed grid orders executed,and after successful creation of the take profit order, the next part *GRID_MAX_COUNT* of hold grid orders added.If total count of active grid orders more than ORDER_Q and hold grid not exhaust each next placed oneafter filling one grid order, until the hold list exhausted. Thus, we always have a given number of active orders to respond to price fluctuations and have a large rangeof price overlap. Then, we do not risk running into the ban from exchange for exceeding the limit.#### Logarithm price option&lt;p id=&quot;logarithm-price-option&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;You can increase the share of the deposit in turnover when calculating the price for grid orders using not a linear,but a logarithmic distribution. The density of orders near the current price will be higher,which increases the likelihood of their execution.Use LINEAR_GRID_K parameter and see '/doc/Model of logarithmic grid.ods' for detail.### Reverse&lt;p id=&quot;reverse&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;It happens that all grid orders completed. Then we believe that we successfully bought the asset,and place a take profit order. Instead of one order, we place a grid, which ensures the break-even strategy.The grid parameters change dynamically, depending on the market conditions, accumulated depositduring execution of the Reverse cycle, and the specified profitability parameters.With each successful completion of the reverse cycle, the accumulated profit volume increases,which reduces the necessary price overlap for the profitable completion of the original cycle.In order for the algorithm not to work for itself in reverse mode, only part of the earned profit is reinvested.PROFIT_REVERSE parameter specifies the reinvestment rule. Leave it as default.### Grid only&lt;p id=&quot;grid-only&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;You can buy/sell asset with grid options at the best price at the moment.Grid parameters are calculated as usual, except the grid shift price threshold, which is calculated onthe basis of the Bollinger Band indicator with a period of 15 minutes. In the Bye cycle, the threshold is set at thelower limit, for Sell it is set at the upper limit. When executing some orders, the grid shift mode remains ACTIVE,which allows us to complete the cycle regardless of the price move.To do this, set the parameter ```GRID_ONLY = True```In this case, the take-profit order will not be placed and Reverse cycle not started. After filling all grid ordersstrategy goes to STOP state.Another option is to set the parameter ```USE_ALL_FUND = True```, which switch-on the mode of continuous Buy/Sell of anasset. In this case, the entire available volume will be converted at the best price and the program will go intostandby mode. The transfer or deposit of the asset activates the conversion mode.&gt;This mode (on the master account) is convenient in combination with the ```COLLECT_ASSETS``` parameter(on the subaccount). Available funds earned in a subaccount are automatically transferred to a master account,where they are automatically converted into the selected stablecoin currency.### Place take profit&lt;p id=&quot;place-take-profit&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;As the grid orders executed, the volume of the take profit order sums up their volume,price averaged and increased to override the fees and earn the specified profit.Do not set PROFIT too large. This reduces the probability of executing a take profit orderwith small price fluctuations. I settled on a value of about 0.5%For adaptive calculate profit before place order you can set PROFIT_MAX.Then its value will be set in the range from PROFIT to PROFIT_MAX. Calculation based on Bollinger Bandindicator with PROFIT_K coefficient.### Restart&lt;p id=&quot;restart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;When take profit order executed the cycle results recorded, the deposit increased by the cycle profit,and bot restarted.### Fee options&lt;p id=&quot;fee-options&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;To correctly count fees for MAKER and TAKER, you must set the FEE_MAKER and FEE_TAKER parameters.For a third currency fee, such as BNB on Binance, or HT on Huobi, set FEE_IN_PAIR = FalseFor fee processing for second currency only, like as KRAKEN, use FEE_SECOND = TruePriority of parameters from larger to smaller is:* FEE_IN_PAIR * FEE_BNB_IN_PAIR* FEE_SECONDAttention: the commission, which is charged in the third coin, is not taken into account in the calculation of income.Control the return on the balance of three coins.### Deposit and withdraw assets on active strategy&lt;p id=&quot;deposit-and-withdraw-assets-on-active-strategy&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;It is better to change the assets amount for the strategy when it has completed the cycle and stopped. However,subject to the following conditions and restrictions and some luck, you can do this on a running strategy.Limits there are next:* strategy must be in &quot;stable state&quot;. This means that the grid and take profit order are placed and the current price isequidistant from them.* Before withdrawing you must get actual info about Free assets (find it on status report in Telegram)*Deposit* asset: For Reverse cycle the increase in the current deposit volume does not occur, the added volume will betaken into account as free. For a direct cycle, the deposit will be increased for the second currency in the Buy cycleand for the first in the Sell cycle.*Withdraw* asset: If all grid orders and take profit order are placed, then only free assets that are not involvedin the turnover are available for withdrawal. If some orders are held, you may accidentally withdraw the assetnecessary for their placement. In this case, you will receive a warning.Use the exchange tools for I/O funds, the necessary and possible adjustments will be made automatically.### Telegram notification&lt;p id=&quot;telegram-notification&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Basic information about the state of the bot, for example, about the start and results of the cycle,can be sent to Telegram bot.&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77513676/198888456-5d1af806-d0f3-42dd-be03-dad57669e6a7.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;### Telegram control&lt;p id=&quot;telegram-control&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;* status - get current status* stop - stop after end of cycle (if current cycle is reverse - only after back to direct cycle)* end - stop after end of cycle, direct and reverse, no differenceAll commands are sent as a reply to message from desired strategy. Use simple text message or menu items. For use menu after first run strategy in Telegram bot use /start command once.If all is normal, you will receive a confirmation that the system has received the command within 10 seconds.### Save data for external analytics&lt;p id=&quot;save-data-for-external-analytics&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Analytic subsystem is not mandatory and has no impact on trading strategy.All data collected into ```funds_rate.db```Cycle time, yield, funds, initial cycle parameters, all this for all pairs and exchanges where this bot launched.In STANDALONE mode for Binance also collected all balances for all assets in trading account. It Sqlite3 db with very simple structure, in table t_funds each row is the result of onecycle with parameters and result.Now I'm use [prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python) -&gt; [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)for calculate and visualisation analytic data. It's useful. You can use funds_rate_exporter.py for start.Find it into repository. Also, you can try the ```martin_binance/service/grafana.json``` as example of consolidated report.### Consolidated asset valuation&lt;p id=&quot;consolidated-asset-valuation&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;If you have several trading pairs on different exchanges, then regular valuation of the asset is a very time-consumingtask.&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://git.io/JDIPt&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;At the end of each trading cycle, deposit data recorded for each currency. Once a day, the current currency rate to USDis queried. In ```funds_rate_exporter.py``` of times per minute calculated data for unloading in[prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python). An example of a summary report implemented on Grafanalocated above.To receive quotes, you need to get the free API key on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/pricing/).Specify the key at the top of the ms_cfg.toml and start ```funds_rate_exporter.py``` as service. For Ubuntu,you can use ```/service/funds_export.service``` ### Asset management&lt;p id=&quot;assets-management&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The result of working in the reverse cycle is a gradual accumulation of assets that are not included in the turnoverand can be withdrawn. With a significant number of trading pairs on several sub-accounts, this is a rather laborioustask. First, you need to transfer the available funds to one account and convert these assets into one coin.Starting from version 1.2.10, the function of automatic transfer of free funds from operating sub-accounts to the mainaccount is implemented.In this case, the main account is not used for trading, it serves for asset management:accumulation, conversion, distribution, withdrawal.Some settings change:Update ```cli_XX_AAABBB.py``` from ```martin_binance/cli_0_BTCUSDT.py.template``` and  set up params ```ex.COLLECT_ASSETS = True```Also need change into exchanges-wrapper server config file, see[details here](https://github.com/DogsTailFarmer/exchanges-wrapper/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#added-for-new-features)### Recovery after any reason crash, restart etc.&lt;p id=&quot;recovery-after-any-reason-crash&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;#### STANDALONE mode* Auto for Network failure, exchange timeout etc. * Auto recovery after restart with full implemented Tmux install (Linux only)* For manual restart with save order and load last state run ```./cli_X_AAABBB.py 1```#### margin mode* Network failure, timeout etc.This is margin layer does, and it's work good. No additional action from user needed.* Hard restart.Margin periodically, every two seconds, save strategy state, and after restart place strategy in suspend state.Strategy check if some order filled out during inactivity and recalculate state for normal operation. You needmanual unsuspend strategy for further work.This will work well if, at the time of interruption, the strategy was in a stable state and there werenot pending actions to place/remove orders. Processing such situations requires research,and I am not sure that it is necessary.  * MaintenanceIf you need setup new version margin or Python strategy, first you need stop strategy.Use Telegram control function, described above.## For developers&lt;p id=&quot;for-developers&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The modular open architecture of the project allows you to use it both as a ready-made solution and in parts whendeveloping your own strategies. See Review chart for reference.Warning.Coverage of overridden [margin strategy-sdk](https://github.com/MarginOpenSource/strategy-sdk) is significant but not complete.Only methods and functions required for normal operation of the presented strategy are implemented.Missing functionality can be implemented on yours own or on request.### Easy wayIf you want to develop 'margin style' strategy, use[template](https://github.com/MarginOpenSource/strategy-template) from margin repository.  In this way you can use itboth independently (STANDALONE mode) and together with [margin.de](https://margin.de)### Independent wayA fully independent strategy that can be used on exchanges that are supported by the[exchanges-wrapper](https://github.com/DogsTailFarmer/exchanges-wrapper). Description and examples of use referenced above.## Known issue&lt;p id=&quot;known-issue&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;_STANDALONE_ mode:* None_With margin.de:_* Not work more than one Python bot at the same time with &quot;pure virtual function&quot; error after some time.You can use new instance for new pair* Sometimes skips the partial fill signal from the margin layer* Sometimes fill signal from the margin come with a delay, for temp fix use EXTRA_CHECK_ORDER_STATE = True* When you STOP strategy from margin terminal, close and then restart it, the strategy is started without approval andrestore (can be duplicated) orders. If you want planed restart martin-binance - delete state.db in./margin folder before restart.## Target&lt;p id=&quot;target&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;* Extended testing capabilities* Optimization ideas* Several users raise reaction from margin support* Resources for development* Get fault tolerance profitable system## Referral link&lt;p id=&quot;referral-link&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Create account on [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=QCS4OGWR) and get 10% discount on all tradingfeeCreate account on [HUOBI](https://www.huobi.com/en-us/topic/double-reward/?invite_code=9uaw3223) and get 10% cashbackon all trading feeCreate account on [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/sign-up?refcode=v_4az2nCP) and get 6% rebate feeCreate account on [OKEX](https://www.okex.com/join/2607649) and get Mystery Boxes worth up to $10,000#### VPSAlso, you can start strategy on [Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=uFdrF8nsdGMc) cloud VPS only for 4.75 € per month#### DonateTo donate and directly support the project, you can transfer funds to these addresses in Binance:*BNB*, *BUSD*, *USDT* (BEP20) 0x5b52c6ba862b11318616ee6cef64388618318b92*USDT* (TRC20) TP1Y43dpY7rrRyTSLaSKDZmFirqvRcpopC</longdescription>
