The workflow for a release is therefore:1. Update the version for release and make a PR to a stable branch; the top   post will be the release notes.2. Merge the PR.That's it. Autorelease handles the rest.When you make the PR to a stable branch, Autorelease will deploy the package totestpypi, and re-download it and test it again. This ensures that you don'tpublish broken packages. After you merge to the stable branch, Autorelease willcut a new release on GitHub, and then publish the release on PyPI.Tools included:* Travis config imports and scripts to automatically test-deploy on testpypi,  then cut a GitHub release, then deploy to PyPI.* Vendor-able GitHub Actions workflows for test-deploy, GitHub release, andPyPI deploy.* Vendor-able `version.py` that gives one true location for version  (`setup.cfg`) while also enabling developer installs to give full and correct  version information.* Vendor-able `setup.py` that keeps all user-required information in the  `setup.cfg`.* Script to draft release notes based on labels on merged PRs.If you're a Python developer who uses Travis and GitHub, Autorelease handleseverything related to releasing to PyPI.</longdescription>
