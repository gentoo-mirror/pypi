	<longdescription># pyphetoolsPython Phenopacket ToolsThis package currently is designed to test how to use the Python version of the phenopackets package together with pandas to create phenopackets from typical supplemental tables.Development goals include making builder code similar to the Java package to create valid phenopackets and to perform JSON Schema-based validation.## SetupFor initial development, we will use notebooks mainly. Do the following to get set up. Note that nowwe are using phenopackets version 2.0.2. openpyxl is needed to read Excel files.```python3 -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activatepip install -r requirements.txtpip install jupyterpython -m ipykernel install --name &quot;venv&quot; --display-name &quot;venv&quot;cd notebooksjupyter-notebook```We have installed the package in the Python Package Index (pypi) at [pyphentools](https://pypi.org/project/pyphetools/).### Updating package in PyPIMake sure the build and twine packages are installed.```python3 -m pip install --upgrade buildpython3 -m pip install --upgrade twine```Update the version number in the pyproject.toml fileBuild and install```python3 -m buildpython3 -m twine upload dist/*```</longdescription>
