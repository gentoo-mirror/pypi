	<longdescription>joeflow=======**The lean workflow automation framework for machines with heart.**.. figure:: docs/img/pexels-photo-1020325.jpeg   :alt: a hand drawn robotJoeflow is a free workflow automation framework designed to bringsimplicity to complex workflows. Joeflow written in `Python`_ based onthe world famous `Django`_ web framework.Here is a little sample of what a workflow written in joeflow may looklike:.. code-block:: python    from django.core.mail import send_mail    from jowflow.models import WorkflowState    from joeflow import tasks    from joeflow.workflows import Workflow    class Shipment(WorkflowState):        email = models.EmailField(blank=True)        shipping_address = models.TextField()        tracking_code = models.TextField()    class ShippingWorkflow(Shipment, Workflow):        checkout = tasks.StartView(fields=[&quot;shipping_address&quot;, &quot;email&quot;])        ship = tasks.UpdateView(fields=[&quot;tracking_code&quot;])        def has_email(self):            if self.email:                return [self.send_tracking_code]        def send_tracking_code(self):            send_mail(                subject=&quot;Your tracking code&quot;,                message=self.tracking_code,                from_email=None,                recipient_list=[self.email],            )        def end(self, task):            pass        edges = [            (checkout, ship),            (ship, has_email),            (has_email, send_tracking_code),            (has_email, end),            (send_tracking_code, end),        ]Design Principles=================Common sense is better than convention--------------------------------------Joeflow does not follow any academic modeling notation developed by apoor PhD student who actually never worked a day in their life.Businesses are already complex which is why Joeflow is rather simple.There are only two types of tasks – human &amp; machine – as well as edgesto connect them. It’s so simple a toddler (or your CEO) could design aworkflow.Lean Automation (breaking the rules)------------------------------------Things don’t always go according to plan especially when humans areinvolved. Even the best workflow can’t cover all possible edge cases.Joeflow embraces that fact. It allows uses to interrupt a workflow at anygiven point and modify it’s current state. All while tracking allchanges. This allows developers to automate the main cases and usershandle manually exceptions. This allows you businesses to shipprototypes and MVPs of workflows. Improvements can be shipped inmultiple iterations without disrupting the business.People------Joeflow is build with all users in mind. Managers should be able todevelop better workflows. Users should able to interact with the tasksevery single day. And developers should be able to rapidly develop andtest new features.Free----Joeflow is open source and collaboratively developed by industry leadersin automation and digital innovation.*Photo by rawpixel.com from Pexels*.. _Python: https://python.org.. _Django: https://www.djangoproject.com/</longdescription>
