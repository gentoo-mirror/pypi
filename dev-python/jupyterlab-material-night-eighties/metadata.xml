From a theme's subdirectory:```shnpm installjupyter labextension link .``` --&gt;## Screenshots![material_night_eighties](./screenshots/material_night_eighties.png 'material_night_eighties theme screenshot')&lt;!--![theme_wallpaper](./screenshots/themer.png &quot;theme wallpaper&quot;)--&gt;## Contributing### Development installNote: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.```bash# Clone the repo to your local environment# Change directory to the jupyterlab_material_night_eighties directory# Install package in development modepip install -e .# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLabjupyter labextension develop . --overwrite# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changesjlpm build```You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminalsto watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.- Terminal A:  ```bash  # Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed  jlpm run watch  ```- Terminal B:  ```sh  jupyter lab  ```With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be builtlocally and available in your running JupyterLab.Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser(you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).By default, the `jlpm build` command generates the source maps for this extensionto make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools.To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:```bashjupyter lab build --minimize=False```### Updating dependenciesCopy `devDependencies` in [`package.json`](./package.json) from [jupyterlab-extension-cookiecutter-ts](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-cookiecutter-ts/blob/3.0/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.python_name%7D%7D/package.json)Then run```shJUPYTER_PLATFORM_DIRS=1```### Development uninstall```bashpip uninstall jupyterlab-material-night-eighties```In development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`command. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`folder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `jupyterlab_material_night_eighties` within that folder.### Testing the extension#### Frontend testsThis extension is using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript code testing.To execute them, execute:```shjlpmjlpm test```#### Integration testsThis extension uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for the integration tests (aka user level tests).More precisely, the JupyterLab helper [Galata](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/galata) is usedto handle testing the extension in JupyterLab.More information are provided within the [ui-tests](./ui-tests/README.md) README.### Packaging the extensionSee [RELEASE](RELEASE.md)</longdescription>
