Inc. and others- homepage_url: https://github.com/nexB/typecode- keywords: filetype, mimetype, libmagic, scancode-toolkit, typecodeTypeCode provides comprehensive filetype and mimetype detection using multipledetectors including libmagic (included as a dependency for Linux, Windows andmacOS) and Pygments. It started as library in scancode-toolkit.Visit https://aboutcode.org and https://github.com/nexB/ for support and download.We run CI tests on: - Travis https://travis-ci.org/github/nexB/typecode - Azure pipelines https://dev.azure.com/nexB/typecode/_buildTo install this package with its full capability (where the binaries forlibmagic are installed), use the `full` option::    pip install typecode[full]If you want to use the version of libmagic (possibly) provided by your operatingsystem, use the `minimal` option::    pip install typecodeIn this case, you will need to provide a working libmagic and its databaseavailable in one of these ways:- **a typecode-libmagic plugin**: See the standard ones at   https://github.com/nexB/scancode-plugins/tree/main/builtins  These can either bundle a libmagic library and its magic database or expose a  system-installed libmagic.  They do so by providing a plugin entry point as a ``scancode_location_provider``  for ``typecode_libmagic`` which points to a callable that must return a mapping  with these two keys:    - 'typecode.libmagic.dll': the absolute path to a libmagic DLL    - 'typecode.libmagic.db': the absolute path to a libmagic 'magic.mgc' database  See for example:    - https://github.com/nexB/scancode-plugins/blob/4da5fe8a5ab1c87b9b4af9e54d7ad60e289747f5/builtins/typecode_libmagic-linux/setup.py#L42    - https://github.com/nexB/scancode-plugins/blob/4da5fe8a5ab1c87b9b4af9e54d7ad60e289747f5/builtins/typecode_libmagic-linux/src/typecode_libmagic/__init__.py#L32- **environment variables**:  - TYPECODE_LIBMAGIC_PATH: the absolute path to a libmagic DLL  - TYPECODE_LIBMAGIC_DB_PATH: the absolute path to a libmagic 'magic.mgc' database- **a system-installed libmagic and its database availale in the system PATH**:The supported libmagic version is 5.39.To set up the development environment::    source configure --devTo run unit tests::    pytest -vvs -n 2To clean up development environment::    ./configure --cleanTo update Pygment to a newer vendored version use vendy:  - Update the version of pygments in ``pyproject.toml``  - Run ``vendy``  - Update the src/typecpde/pygments_lexers_mapping.py    and src/typecode/pygments_lexers.py scripts accordingly, including their    ABOUT files</longdescription>
