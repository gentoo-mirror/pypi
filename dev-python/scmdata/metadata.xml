	<longdescription># scmdata&lt;!---Can use start-after and end-before directives in docs, seehttps://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/organising_content.html#inserting-other-documents-directly-into-the-current-document--&gt;&lt;!--- sec-begin-description --&gt;**scmdata** provides some useful data handling routines for dealing with data related to simple climate models(SCMs aka reduced complexity climate models, RCMs). In particular, it provides a high-performance way ofhandling and serialising (including to netCDF) timeseries data along with attached metadata.**scmdata** was inspired by [pyam](https://github.com/IAMconsortium/pyam) and was originally part of the[openscm](https://github.com/openscm/openscm&gt;) package.[![CI](https://github.com/openscm/scmdata/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/openscm/scmdata/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)[![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/climate-resource/scmdata/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/openscm/scmdata)[![Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/scmdata/badge/?version=latest)](https://scmdata.readthedocs.io)**PyPI :**[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scmdata.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/scmdata/)[![PyPI: Supported Python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/scmdata.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/scmdata/)[![PyPI install](https://github.com/openscm/scmdata/actions/workflows/install.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/openscm/scmdata/actions/workflows/install.yaml)**Other info :**[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/openscm/scmdata.svg)](https://github.com/openscm/scmdata/blob/main/LICENSE)[![Last Commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/openscm/scmdata.svg)](https://github.com/openscm/scmdata/commits/main)[![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/openscm/scmdata.svg)](https://github.com/openscm/scmdata/graphs/contributors)&lt;!--- sec-end-description --&gt;Full documentation can be found at:[scmdata.readthedocs.io](https://scmdata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).We recommend reading the docs there because the internal documentation linksdon't render correctly on GitHub's viewer.## Installation&lt;!--- sec-begin-installation --&gt;scmdata can be installed with conda or pip:```bashpip install scmdataconda install -c conda-forge scmdata```Additional dependencies can be installed using```bash# To add plotting dependenciespip install scmdata[plots]# To add notebook dependenciespip install scmdata[notebooks]# If you are installing with conda, we recommend# installing the extras by hand because there is no stable# solution yet (issue here: https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/7502)```&lt;!--- sec-end-installation --&gt;### For developers&lt;!--- sec-begin-installation-dev --&gt;For development, we rely on [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for all ourdependency management. To get started, you will need to make sure that poetryis installed([instructions here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer),we found that pipx and pip worked better to install on a Mac).For all of work, we use our `Makefile`.You can read the instructions out and run the commands by hand if you wish,but we generally discourage this because it can be error prone.In order to create your environment, run `make virtual-envir˚onment`.If there are any issues, the messages from the `Makefile` should guide youthrough. If not, please raise an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/openscm/scmdata/issues)˚.For the rest of our developer docs, please see [](development-reference).[issue_tracker]: https://github.com/openscm/scmdata/issues&lt;!--- sec-end-installation-dev --&gt;</longdescription>
