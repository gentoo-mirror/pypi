Typically, these processes are command line applications (i.e. have no GUI) and usually do not interact really with a user at all. The primary purpose of ``pman`` is to provide other software agents the ability to execute processes via ``http``.Originally, ``pman`` was designed to track simple processes executed on the local system. In addition, ``pman`` keeps a record of the current and historical state of processes that it has executed and is thus able to respond to queries about the processes. Some of the queries that ``pman`` can address are- *state*: Is job &lt;XYZ&gt; still running?- *result*: What is the stdout (or stderr) from job &lt;XYZ&gt;?- *control*: Kill job &lt;XYZ&gt;``pman`` also maintains a persistent human-readable/friendly database-in-the-filesystem of jobs and states of jobs.Current versions of ``pman`` however can use container-based backends (swarm and openshift) to execute processes. In those cases, the internal database of tracking jobs becomes superfluous. Future versions of ``pman`` might depreciate the local/internal DB tracking.************Installation************Installation is relatively straightforward, and we recommend using either python virtual environments or docker.Python Virtual Environment==========================On Ubuntu, install the Python virtual environment creator.. code-block:: bash  sudo apt install virtualenv virtualenvwrapperThen, create a directory for your virtual environments e.g.:.. code-block:: bash  mkdir ~/python-envsYou might want to add to your .bashrc file these two lines:.. code-block:: bash    export WORKON_HOME=~/python-envs    source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh(Note depending on distro, the ``virtualenvwrapper.sh`` path might be.. code-block:: bash    /usr/share/virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper.shThen you can source your .bashrc and create a new Python3 virtual environment:.. code-block:: bash    source .bashrc    mkvirtualenv --python=python3 python_envTo activate or &quot;enter&quot; the virtual env:.. code-block:: bash    workon python_envTo deactivate virtual env:.. code-block:: bash    deactivateUsing the ``fnndsc/pman`` dock==============================The easiest option however, is to just use the ``fnndsc/pman`` dock... code-block:: bash    docker pull fnndsc/pmanand then run.. code-block:: bash    docker run  --name pman         \                -v /home:/Users     \                --rm -ti            \                fnndsc/pman         \                --rawmode 1 --http  \                --port 5010         \                --listeners 12*****Usage*****``pman`` usage===============For ``pman`` detailed information, see the `pman wiki page &lt;https://github.com/FNNDSC/pman/wiki/pman-overview&gt;`_... code-block:: html    ARGS        [--ip &lt;IP&gt;]        The IP interface on which to listen.        [--port &lt;port&gt;]        The port on which to listen. Defaults to '5010'.        [--protocol &lt;protcol&gt;]        The protocol to interpret. Defaults to 'tcp'.        [--rawmode]        Internal zmq socket server mode. A value of '1' is usually used        here.        [--listeners &lt;numberOfListenerThreads&gt;]        The number of internal threads to which requests are dispatched.        [--http]        Send return strings as HTTP formatted replies with content-type html.        [--debugToFile]        If specified, send debugging results to file.        [--debugToFile &lt;file&gt;]        In conjunction with --debugToFile, file which will receive debugging info.        [--listenerSleep &lt;time&gt;]        A small delay in the listener loop to prevent busy-wait.        Default is 0.1 seconds.        [--directiveFile &lt;directiveFile&gt;]        The location of a message-conformant &lt;directiveFile&gt;. If this file        if found by the FileIO thread, its contents will be read and        executed, after which the file will be deleted.        [--DBsavePeriod &lt;time&gt;]        The periodicity in seconds for the internal DB save.        [--enableTokenAuth]        Enables token based authorization and can be configured to look for a .ini        file or an openshift secret.        [--tokenPath &lt;tokenPath&gt;]        Specify the absolute path to the token in the file system.        By default, this looks for the pfiohConfig.ini file in the current working directory.        [-x|--desc]        Provide an overview help page.        [-y|--synopsis]        Provide a synopsis help summary.        [--version]        Print internal version number and exit.        [-v|--verbosity &lt;level&gt;]        Set the verbosity level. &quot;0&quot; typically means no/minimal output. Allows for        more fine tuned output control as opposed to '--quiet' that effectively        silences everything.        --container-env &lt;env&gt;        The container env within which to run.********EXAMPLES********Start ``pman`` with 12 listeners:.. code-block:: bash        pman                                                        \\                --ip 127.0.0.1                                      \\                --port 5010                                         \\                --rawmode 1                                         \\                --http                                              \\                --listeners 12                                      \\                --verbosity 1</longdescription>
