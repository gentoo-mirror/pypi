	<longdescription>Myers diff of two lists or files---------------------------------Inspired byhttps://gist.github.com/adamnew123456/37923cf53f51d6b9af32a539cdfa7cc4API===``myers.diff(a, b, context=None, format=None)``~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(`myers.py, 25-60 &lt;https://github.com/rec/myers/blob/master/myers.py#L25-L60&gt;`_)Return the Myers diff of two lists.The result is a list of (action, line) pairs,where ``action`` is one of ``KEEP``, ``INSERT``, ``REMOVE``, or ``OMIT``(which happen to be the characters k, i, r, and o).ARGUMENTS:   ``a``, ``b``:     The two files to compare   ``context``:     How many lines of context to keep between blocks of changes?     ``None``, the default, means keep all unchanged lines.     ``0`` means throw away all the unchanged lines.   ``format``:     If a dictionary, it is used to format     each diff entry.  If true, the default dictionary above is     used to format the diff entries.  Otherwise they are returned as-is.(automatically generated by `doks &lt;https://github.com/rec/doks/&gt;`_ on 2020-11-07T12:19:33.047064)</longdescription>
