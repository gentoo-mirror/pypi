We do expect users to define this variable within their own CI jobdefinitions. The number of tests executed is likely to be dependent on the CIjob.We discourage defining this inside places like `tox.ini` because when adeveloper runs tests, they are likely to endup running a different number oftests. Also, this feature makes no sense if you try to mention a specific test.## Links- [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)- [file an issue](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-plus/issues)- [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)- [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)- [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project)</longdescription>
