	<longdescription>Linux Distribution - a Linux OS platform information API========================================================The `ld` (for: Linux Distribution) package provides information about theLinux distribution it runs on, such as a reliable machine-readable ID, orversion information.It is a renewed alternative implementation for Python'soriginal `platform.linux_distribution` function, but it also provides much morefunctionality.An alternative implementation became necessary because Python 3.5 deprecatedthis function, and Python 3.7 is expected to remove it altogether.Its predecessor function `platform.dist` was already deprecated sincePython 2.6 and is also expected to be removed in Python 3.7.Still, there are many cases in which access to that information is needed.See [Python issue 1322](https://bugs.python.org/issue1322) for moreinformation.The `ld` package implements a robust and inclusive way of retrieving theinformation about a Linux distribution based on new standards and old methods,namely from these data sources (from high to low precedence):* The os-release file `/etc/os-release`, if present.* The output of the `lsb_release` command, if available.* The distro release file (`/etc/*(-|_)(release|version)`), if present.## Installation```shellpip install ld```For dev:```shellpip install https://github.com/nir0s/ld/archive/master.tar.gz```## Python and Distribution SupportThe `ld` package is supported on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5, and onany Linux distribution that provides one or more of the data sourcesused by this package.This package is currently tested on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.5, with testdata that mimics the exact behavior of the data sources of the followingLinux distributions:* Arch Linux* CentOS 5/7* Debian 8* Exherbo* Fedora 19/23* KVM for IBM z Systems 1* Mageia 5* openSUSE Leap 42* Oracle Linux Server 7* RHEL 6/7* Slackware 14* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12* Ubuntu 14## Usage```python&gt;&gt;&gt; import ld&gt;&gt;&gt; ld.linux_distribution(full_distribution_name=False)'('centos', '7.1.1503', 'Core')'```Several more functions are available. For a complete description of theAPI, see the [latest API documentation](http://ld.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).</longdescription>
