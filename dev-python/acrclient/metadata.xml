	<longdescription># Python ACR Client moduleContains a simple client for calling the v2 endpoints of the [ACRCloud](https://www.acrcloud.com) API.## Installation```bashpoetry add acrclient# or on old setup style projectspip -m install acrclient```## Usage```python&gt;&gt;&gt; from acrclient import Client&gt;&gt;&gt; client = Client(bearer_token=&quot;bearer-token&quot;)```## Development```bash# setup a dev envpython -mvenv env. env/bin/activate# install a modern poetry versionpython -mpip install poetry&gt;=1.2.0# install deps and dev versionpoetry install# make changes, run testspoetry run pytest```## Release ManagementThe CI/CD setup uses semantic commit messages following the [conventional commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).There is a GitHub Action in [.github/workflows/semantic-release.yaml](./.github/workflows/semantic-release.yaml)that uses [go-semantic-commit](https://go-semantic-release.xyz/) to create newreleases.The commit message should be structured as follows:```&lt;type&gt;[optional scope]: &lt;description&gt;[optional body][optional footer(s)]```The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:1. **fix:** a commit of the type `fix` patches gets released with a PATCH version bump1. **feat:** a commit of the type `feat` gets released as a MINOR version bump1. **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:` gets released as a MAJOR version bump1. types other than `fix:` and `feat:` are allowed and don't trigger a releaseIf a commit does not contain a conventional commit style message you can fixit during the squash and merge operation on the PR.Once a commit has landed on the `main` branch a release will be created and automatically published to [pypi](https://pypi.org/)using the GitHub Action in [.github/workflows/release.yaml](./.github/workflows/release.yaml) which uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)to publish the package to pypi.## LicenseThis package is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, version 3 of the License.## CopyrightCopyright (c) 2023 [Radio Bern RaBe](http://www.rabe.ch)</longdescription>
