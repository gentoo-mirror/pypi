	<longdescription>smartopen=========smartopen is a command line program that will transform text accordingto handlers to URLs and open themUsage-----``smartopen --help`` displays the program usage:&quot;&quot;&quot;Usage: smartopen [options]Options:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -c CONFIG, --config=CONFIG                        config file to read  -u, --url             print the first url handled  -a, --all             print all handlers that match the query  -H HANDLERS, --handler=HANDLERS                        name of the handler to use, in order  --print-handlers      print all handlers in order they would be tried&quot;&quot;&quot;smartopen reads text from standard input or command line arguments.The handlers are then iterated through in a configurable order and, ifthe handler can transform the text into a URL, the URL is thenprocessed.  Unless otherwise specified by command line options(e.g. --url, --all), the first matching URL is then opened in firefox.Handlers--------smartopen has a pluggable system of configurable handlers.  Thesetuptools entry point ``[smartopen.locations]`` is an extension pointfor the handlers.  Several handlers come with smartopen, or you canwrite your own.URL:  a resolvable URLGoogle: a google searchWikipedia: a Wikipedia articleGoogleMaps: an address in google mapsetc.Configuration-------------smartopen uses a configuration file that defines the order of thehandlers and their behavior.A simple example is shown here:http://k0s.org/hg/smartopen/file/tip/smartopen.iniInterfacing With Your Environment---------------------------------While smartopen is useful of its own right, its utility may beenhanced by using as part of an environment.  For instance, I run thefluxbox window manager which allows the use of hotkeys.  By bindingsmartopen to ``Ctrl+Alt+s`` and using ``xclip``, I can open a URL that ismappable to a smartopen handler with a keyboard shortcut.  Therelevant line from my ``~/.fluxbox/keys`` file reads:Control Mod1 s :ExecCommand /home/jhammel/python/smartopen.py &quot;$(xclip -o)&quot; # smartopen----Posterity is gained...----------------------I mostly wrote smartopen to help me.  That it has.However...a few things....- better way of setting up handlers?- really, i want to push down to choose what i think the handler is,  but only should we I release the hand that Jesus becomes Magic  (sorry, I hate the movie too)....and more?Was reading about catfish....e.g.http://www.addictivetips.com/ubuntu-linux-tips/catfish-file-searching-tool-for-ubuntu-linux/...&quot;&quot;&quot;file search tool that support several different engines A file search tool using different backends which is configurable viathe command line.This program acts as a frontend for different file search engines.The interface is intentionally lightweight and simple. But it takesconfiguration options from the command line.Currently find, locate, tracker, strigi, pinot, and beagle aresupported as backends&quot;&quot;&quot;.Should smartopen....be a pluggable thing that takes text and findsboth *the handler* and *what to do with it*???I mean, short of it being a neural network anyway....</longdescription>
