	<longdescription>[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jendrikseipp/txt2tags.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jendrikseipp/txt2tags)[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)# Txt2tagsTxt2tags is a document generator. It reads a text file withminimal markup such as `**bold**` and `//italic//` and converts itto the following formats: * AsciiDoc * Creole 1.0 * DocBook * DokuWiki * Google Wiki * HTML * LaTeX * Lout * MagicPoint * Markdown * MoinMoin * PmWiki * Plain Text * SGML * UNIX Manpage * Wikipedia/MediaWikiYou can use it as a command line program or in a Python application.# InstallationWe recommend using [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/) to install and run txt2tags in an isolated environment without affecting any system packages:    python3 -m pip install --user pipx    python3 -m pipx ensurepath    pipx install txt2tags    txt2tags --helpOf course you can also use pip to install txt2tags globally or in a virtual environment:    pip install -U txt2tags# UsageSimple example for command line usage:1. Write a text file like this (leave 1st line blank):   ```   = Hello =   I'm a robot. You're my **master**!   [smile.jpg]   ```2. Run this command:   `txt2tags --target html --no-headers file.t2t`3. The result is:   ```   &lt;H1&gt;Hello&lt;/H1&gt;   &lt;P&gt;   I'm a robot. You're my &lt;B&gt;master&lt;/B&gt;!   &lt;IMG ALIGN=&quot;middle&quot; SRC=&quot;smile.jpg&quot; BORDER=&quot;0&quot; ALT=&quot;&quot;&gt;   &lt;/P&gt;   ```# HistoryAurelio Jargas started the development of Txt2tags in 2001. The programsaw several releases from 2001 to 2010, the last of which was version2.6. Afterwards, Aurelio became less involved in the development. Still,many new features were added in the main repository(https://github.com/txt2tags/txt2tags), but they were never officiallyreleased. In my opinion, many of the new features are only useful for avery small set of users. The extra code adds bloat to the program andmakes it hard to maintain the code. Unfortunately, these concerns arenot shared by the whole Txt2tags development team. Therefore, I decidedto branch off version 2.6 and maintain a simpler txt2tags version thatworks on Python 3. The file [TODO.md](TODO.md) lists the goals for theproject.If you'd like to help out with any of the tasks, please get in touch.Pull requests are very welcome!</longdescription>
