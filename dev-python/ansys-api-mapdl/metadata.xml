	<longdescription>### ansys-api-mapdl gRPC Interface PackageThis Python package contains the auto-generated gRPC Python interface files formapdl.#### InstallationProvided that these wheels have been published to public PyPI, they can beinstalled with:```pip install ansys-api-mapdl```Otherwise, see the#### BuildTo build the gRPC packages, run:```pip install buildpython -m build```This will create both the source distribution containing just the protofilesalong with the wheel containing the protofiles and build Python interfacefiles.Note that the interface files are identical regardless of the version of Pythonused to generate them, but the last pre-built wheel for ``grpcio~=1.17`` wasPython 3.7, so to improve your build time, use Python 3.7 when building thewheel.#### Manual DeploymentAfter building the packages, manually deploy them with:```pip install twinetwine upload dist/*```Note that this is automatically done through CI/CD.#### Automatic DeploymentThis repository contains GitHub CI/CD that enables the automatic building ofsource and wheel packages for these gRPC Python interface files. By default,these are built on PRs, the main branch, and on tags when pushing. Artifactsare uploaded for each PR.To publicly release wheels to PyPI, ensure your branch is up-to-date and thenpush tags. For example, for the version ``v0.5.0``.```bashgit tag v0.5.0git push --tags```</longdescription>
