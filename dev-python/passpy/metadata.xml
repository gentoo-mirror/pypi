	<longdescription># passpy --  ZX2C4's pass compatible library and clipasspy has been written to be a platform independent library and clithat is compatible with [ZX2C4's pass](http://www.passwordstore.org).passpy saves your passwords in gpg encrypted files and optionally uses git as arevision tool.  All files are stored inside the directory given by the`PASSWORD_STORE_DIR` environment variable (`~/.password-store` if not set) andcan be organised into folders.  You can also just copy the whole store to haveyour passwords available where ever you like.## DocumentationThe latest documentation is available at[readthedocs](https://passpy.readthedocs.org).## Installation### PyPIJust do```$ [sudo] pip install passpy```### Arch LinuxThe package `python-passpy` is available in the AUR for you to installhowever you like.### ManuallyEither clone the git repository using```$ git clone https://github.com/bfrascher/passpy.git```or download the source from the releases tab and extract it.Afterwards change into the new folder and do```$ [sudo] python setup.py install```## Dependenciespasspy depends on Python 3.3 or later (it has mostly been tested usingPython 3.5).  The program makes use of [git](https://www.git-scm.com)and [gpg2](https://gnupg.org) as well as either xclip or xsel onLinux.The following Python packages will be installed alongside passpy:- [gitpython](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython)- [python-gnupg](https://bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/python-gnupg)- [click](http://click.pocoo.org/)- [pyperclip](https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip)If you are on Windows and want colourised output on the command line,you will additionally need to install[colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama).## Changelog### 1.0.2- Now also read the default password store location from `PASSWORD_STORE_DIR`  for the cli.- Show a better error message when the password store does not exist.- Always use the `path` parameter of `Store.init_store` relative to  `Store.store_dir`.### 1.0.1- Fix documentation.### 1.0.0- Read the default password store location from the `PASSWORD_STORE_DIR`  environment variable, just like `pass` does (contributed by Jonathan Waldrep).</longdescription>
