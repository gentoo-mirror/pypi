	<longdescription>=======nmrglue=======What is nmrglue?----------------nmrglue is a module for working with NMR data in Python. When used with thenumpy, scipy, and matplotlib packages nmrglue provides a robust interpretedenvironment for processing, analyzing, and inspecting NMR data.Important Links---------------* Landing page: http://www.nmrglue.com* Documentation: http://nmrglue.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html* Examples: http://nmrglue.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/index.html* Mailing List: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nmrglue-discuss* Source code: https://github.com/jjhelmus/nmrglueWhat can nmrglue do?--------------------nmrglue has the ability to read, write and convert between a number of commonNMR file formats including Varian, Bruker, NMRPipe, and Sparky files. Thefiles, which are represented in python as dictionaries of spectral parametersand Numpy array objects, can be easily examined, modified and processed asdesired.nmrglue provides a number of common functions for processing NMR data such asapodization, spectral shifting, Fourier and other transformations, baselinesmoothing and flattening, and linear prediction. In addition new processingschemes can be implemented easily using the nmrglue provided functions and themultitude of numerical routines provided by the Numpy and Scipy packages.When used in conjunction with the matplotlib (or other) python plottinglibrary nmrglue can be used to create publication quality figures of NMRspectrum or examine data interactively.nmrglue can be used to analyze NMR data, with routines to perform peakpicking, multidimensional lineshape fitting (peak fitting), and peakintegration. New analysis methods can be rapidly developed and tested inPython or by integrating Fortran and C/C++ code.To get started, see our online documentation:http://nmrglue.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.htmlCiting nmrglue--------------If you find nmrglue useful in your research please cite the package as:J.J.
