	<longdescription># Fluffy PancakesFluffy Pancakes is a library designed to detect phishing websites. It uses Machine Learning to predict the output with an accuracy of 95.2%. *Note: Please bear with us for a few seconds to get the output since the library is computationally intensive. We felt bad for making you wait, so we have included a progress bar that you can enable to see the percentage of progress and also see the time taken for execution. Also note that the library heavily depends on a stable internet connection to function its best and to obtain the results. So, the quicker your internet connection is, the faster your results will be :).*# Usage- #### Install the module    ```sh     $ pip install fluffypancakes    ```- #### Grant Permissions    Use `sudo chmod 777` to give permissions to the **&lt;System Python File PATH&gt;/site-packages/fluffypancakes/dependencies/** folder.- #### Import     ```py     $ from fluffypancakes import fluffypancakes as fp     ```- #### Call the function and Pass the URL     ```py     $ result = fp.serve('&lt;website URL&gt;', progressBar=True)     $ print(result)     ```- #### Defaults     The default value of the progressBar is 'True'. However, the option can be enabled or disabled with *boolean* 'True' or 'False' respectively.# Output&gt; -1 : Legitimate Website&gt; 1 : Phishing Website&gt; &quot;The URL entered is either Invalid or the Host is unserviceable&quot; : For invalid URLs and Unservicable HostsThe output is predicted with an accuracy of 95.2%. It is not a definitive classification. # DependenciesPython dependencies:- beautifulsoup4&gt;=4.9.0- numpy&gt;=1.17.2- pandas&gt;=1.0.4- python-whois&gt;=0.7.2- requests&gt;=2.23.0- scikit-learn&gt;=0.21.3- selenium&gt;=3.141.0- sklearn&gt;=0.0- tqdm&gt;=4.46.0- urllib3&gt;=1.25.8Installing this module will install all the dependencies automatically.Additional dependencies:- Chrome Driver : You'll need a chromedriver in order to complete execution of the code. You can get the file from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/). Unzip and add the &quot;chromedriver.exe&quot; (Windows) or &quot;chromedriver&quot; (Linux and MacOS) file to the PYTHONPATH environment variable.    Well, that's a lot of work right? We know! So, we have included the current stable version of the chromedriver in the [dependencies](https://github.com/suhasrsharma/FluffyPancakes/tree/master/dependencies) folder of the repo.    The code automatically detects the OS (Windows, Linux Based and MacOS) and picks up the respective chromedriver file.    **You're all set to go.** Although, if, by any chance, you face an issue, just add to PYTHONPATH, the directory structure to where you downloaded this repository.# DevelopmentWant to contribute? Great!FluffyPancakes uses http requests, bs4, selenium, and of course, Machine Learning, and a lot more libraries. You can find the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/suhasrsharma/FluffyPancakes).Make sure you use the following command to get the exact versions of pytest and twine:```sh$ pip install -e .[dev]```You can find the sample test case [here](https://github.com/suhasrsharma/FluffyPancakes/blob/master/src/sample_test.py).# Development Status##### Development Status :: 4 - Beta##### Operating System :: OS Independent# License### MIT---In collaboration with the [Center for ISFCR](https://www.isfcr.pes.edu/) at [PES University](https://www.pes.edu/), Bangalore, India.
