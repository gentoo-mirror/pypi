	<longdescription>=============================== Gnocchi - Metric as a Service===============================.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/gnocchi.svg    :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/gnocchi.. image:: doc/source/_static/gnocchi-logo.pngGnocchi is an open-source time series database.The problem that Gnocchi solves is the storage and indexing of time seriesdata and resources at a large scale. This is useful in modern cloud platformswhich are not only huge but also are dynamic and potentially multi-tenant.Gnocchi takes all of that into account.Gnocchi has been designed to handle large amounts of aggregates being storedwhile being performant, scalable and fault-tolerant. While doing this, the goalwas to be sure to not build any hard dependency on any complex storage system.Gnocchi takes a unique approach to time series storage: rather than storingraw data points, it aggregates them before storing them. This built-in featureis different from most other time series databases, which usually supportthis mechanism as an option and compute aggregation (average, minimum, etc.) atquery time.Because Gnocchi computes all the aggregations at ingestion, getting the databack is extremely fast, as it just needs to read back the pre-computed results.You can read the full documentation online at http://gnocchi.osci.io.</longdescription>
