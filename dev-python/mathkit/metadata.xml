Addition&quot;)print(&quot;2. Subtraction&quot;)print(&quot;3. Multiplication&quot;)print(&quot;4. Division&quot;)print(&quot;5. Modulas&quot;)print(&quot;6. Power&quot;)print(&quot;7. Square&quot;)print(&quot;8. Cube&quot;)print(&quot;9. Square Root&quot;)print(&quot;10. Cube Root&quot;)print(&quot;11. Factorial&quot;)print(&quot;12. Percentage&quot;)print(&quot;13. LCM&quot;)print(&quot;14. HCF&quot;)print(&quot;15. Logarithm&quot;)print(&quot;16. Exit&quot;)choice = int(input(&quot;Enter your choice: &quot;))if choice == 1:    add()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.elif choice == 2:    sub()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.elif choice == 3:    mul()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.elif choice == 4:    div()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.elif choice == 5:    mod()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.elif choice == 6:    power()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.elif choice == 7:    sqr()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.elif choice == 8:    cube()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.elif choice == 9:    sqrt()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.elif choice == 10:    cbrt()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.elif choice == 11:    fact()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.elif choice == 12:    percentage()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.elif choice == 13:    lcm()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.elif choice == 14:    hcf()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.elif choice == 15:    log()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.elif choice == 16:    exit()else:    print(&quot;Invalid choice!&quot;)    print(&quot;Press Enter to continue&quot;)    input()```## Example Usage If you decide to predefine numbers```pythonimport mathkitmathkit.add(5, 3)  # Output: Your answer is 8mathkit.cbrt(27)  # Output: The cube root of 27 is 3.0mathkit.div(10, 2)  # Output: Your answer is 5.0mathkit.fact(5)  # Output: The factorial of 5 is 120mathkit.hcf(24, 36)  # Output: The H.C.F. of 24 and 36 is 12mathkit.lcm(12, 18)  # Output: The LCM of 12 and 18 is 36mathkit.log(100)  # Output: Logarithm of 100 (base e) is 4.605...mathkit.mod(10, 3)  # Output: Your answer is 1mathkit.mul(4, 5)  # Output: Product = 20mathkit.per(50, 10)  # Output: 10 percent of 50 is 5mathkit.power(2, 3)  # Output: The answer is: 8mathkit.sqrt(25)  # Output: Square root of 25 is 5.0mathkit.sqr(4)  # Output: The square of 4 is 16mathkit.sub(8, 3)  # Output: Your answer is 5``` ## For more information, please visit the GitHub repository.</longdescription>
