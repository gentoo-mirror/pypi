	<longdescription>## CERC Geometry LibraryThis project is a library with geometry classes with functions built purposely to manipulate geometry representationof buildings. It has the following classes:- Plane: has various methods that models a flat surface with no thickness- Point: contains different methods to manipulate points in 2 and 3 dimensional spaces- Polygon: contains methods to manipulate different kinds of polygons- Polyhedron contains a set of methods that manipulate three-dimensional shape with flat polygonal faces</longdescription>
