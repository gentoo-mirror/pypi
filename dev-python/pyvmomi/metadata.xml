	<longdescription>.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/vmware/pyvmomi.svg?branch=v6.0.0.2016.4    :target: https://travis-ci.org/vmware/pyvmomi    :alt: Build Status.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/pyvmomi.svg    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvmomi/    :alt: DownloadspyVmomi is the Python SDK for the VMware vSphere API that allows you to manage ESX, ESXi, and vCenter.Getting Started================To get started, see the`getting started guide &lt;http://vmware.github.io/pyvmomi-community-samples/#getting-started&gt;`_.You'll need `Python &lt;https://www.python.org/downloads/&gt;`_,`pip &lt;https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/&gt;`_, and the`samples project &lt;http://vmware.github.io/pyvmomi-community-samples/&gt;`_.Installing==========The master is code that is in development, official releases are tagged andposted to `pypi &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvmomi/&gt;`_* The official release is available using pip, just run  ``pip install --upgrade pyvmomi``.* To install the version in `github &lt;https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi&gt;`_ use  ``python setup.py develop`` for development install or  ``python setup.py install``.* To install `github's version &lt;https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi&gt;`_ with sso support, just run  ``pip install -e .[sso]`` inside project's home folder.Testing=======Unit tests can be invoked by using the `tox &lt;https://testrun.org/tox/&gt;`_ command. You may have toconfigure multiple python interpreters so that you can test in all theenvironments listed in ``tox.ini`` or you will have to run ``tox`` with the``-e`` flag to run only in your version of python. For example, if you onlyhave Python 2.7 then ``tox -e py27`` will limit your test run to Python 2.7.Contributing============* Research `open issues &lt;https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue&gt;`_* Follow the `contribution standards &lt;https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi/wiki/Contributions&gt;`_Documentation=============For general language neutral documentation of vSphere Management API see:* `vSphere WS SDK API Docs &lt;https://code.vmware.com/apis/968/vsphere&gt;`_Python Support==============* pyVmomi supports Python 3.4+Versioning====================pyVmomi: **X.Y.Z.U.P**vCenter-related:**X.Y** - (Major release), **Z** - (Update release), **U** - (Patch)pyVmomi-related:**P** - (pyVmomi patches)Compatibility Policy====================pyVmomi maintains minimum backward compatibility with the previous*four* releases of *vSphere* and it's own previous four releases.Compatibility with much older versions may continue to work but willnot be actively supported.For example, version v6.0.0 is most compatible with vSphere 6.0, 5.5, 5.1 and5.0. Initial releases compatible with a version of vSphere will bare a nakedversion number of v6.0.0 indicating that version of pyVmomi was releasedsimultaneously with the *GA* version of vSphere with the same version number.Related Projects================* VMware vSphere Automation SDK for Python: https://github.com/vmware/vsphere-automation-sdk-python* Samples Project: https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi-community-samplesHave fun!</longdescription>
