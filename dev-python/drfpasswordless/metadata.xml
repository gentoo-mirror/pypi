	<longdescription>![splash-image]![ci-image]drfpasswordless is a quick way to integrate ‘passwordless’ auth intoyour Django Rest Framework project using a user’s email address ormobile number only (herein referred to as an alias).Built to work with DRF’s own TokenAuthentication system, it sends theuser a 6-digit callback token to a given email address or a mobilenumber. The user sends it back correctly and they’re given anauthentication token (again, provided by Django Rest Framework’sTokenAuthentication system).Callback tokens by default expire after 15 minutes.Example Usage:==============```bashcurl -X POST -d “email=aaron@email.com” localhost:8000/auth/email/```Email to aaron@email.com:```...&lt;h1&gt;Your login token is 815381.&lt;/h1&gt;...```Return Stage```bashcurl -X POST -d &quot;email=aaron@example.com&amp;token=815381&quot; localhost:8000/auth/token/&gt; HTTP/1.0 200 OK&gt; {&quot;token&quot;:&quot;76be2d9ecfaf5fa4226d722bzdd8a4fff207ed0e”}```Requirements============- Python (3.7+)- Django (2.2+)- Django Rest Framework + AuthToken (3.10+)- Python-Twilio (Optional, for mobile.)Install=======1. Install drfpasswordless   ```   pipenv install drfpasswordless   ```2. Add Django Rest Framework’s Token Authentication to your Django Rest   Framework project.```python REST_FRAMEWORK = {     'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES':    ('rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication', )} INSTALLED_APPS = [     ...     'rest_framework',     'rest_framework.authtoken',     'drfpasswordless',      ... ]```And run```bashpython manage.py migrate```3. Set which types of contact points are allowed for auth in your   Settings.py. The available options are ``EMAIL`` and ``MOBILE``.```pythonPASSWORDLESS_AUTH = {   ..   'PASSWORDLESS_AUTH_TYPES': ['EMAIL', 'MOBILE'],   ..}```   By default drfpasswordless looks for fields named ``email`` or ``mobile``   on the User model. If an alias provided doesn’t belong to any given user,   a new user is created.   3a. If you’re using ``email``, see the Configuring Email section   below.   3b. If you’re using ``mobile``, see the Configuring Mobile section   below.4. Add ``drfpasswordless.urls`` to your urls.py```python from django.urls import path, include urlpatterns = [     ..     path('', include('drfpasswordless.urls')),     .. ]```5. You can now POST to either of the endpoints:```bashcurl -X POST -d &quot;email=aaron@email.com&quot; localhost:8000/auth/email/// ORcurl -X POST -d &quot;mobile=+15552143912&quot; localhost:8000/auth/mobile/```   A 6 digit callback token will be sent to the contact point.6. The client has 15 minutes to use the 6 digit callback token   correctly. If successful, they get an authorization token in exchange   which the client can then use with Django Rest Framework’s   TokenAuthentication scheme.```bashcurl -X POST -d &quot;email=aaron@email.com&amp;token=815381&quot; localhost:8000/auth/token/&gt; HTTP/1.0 200 OK&gt; {&quot;token&quot;:&quot;76be2d9ecfaf5fa4226d722bzdd8a4fff207ed0e”}```Configuring Emails------------------Specify the email address you’d like to send the callback token fromwith the ``PASSWORDLESS_EMAIL_NOREPLY_ADDRESS`` setting.```pythonPASSWORDLESS_AUTH = {   ..   'PASSWORDLESS_AUTH_TYPES': ['EMAIL',],   'PASSWORDLESS_EMAIL_NOREPLY_ADDRESS': 'noreply@example.com',   ..}```You’ll also need to set up an SMTP server to send emails but fordevelopment you can set up a dummy development smtp server to testemails. Sent emails will print to the console. `Read morehere. &lt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/email/#console-backend&gt;`__```python# Settings.pyEMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'```Configuring Mobile------------------You’ll need to have the python twilio module installed```bashpipenv install twilio```and set the ``TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`` and ``TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`` environmentvariables. These are read from `os.environ`, so make sure you don't putthem in your settings file accidentally.You’ll also need to specify the number you send the token from with the``PASSWORDLESS_MOBILE_NOREPLY_NUMBER`` setting.Templates=========If you’d like to use a custom email template for your email callbacktoken, specify your template name with this setting:```bashPASSWORDLESS_AUTH = {   ...  'PASSWORDLESS_EMAIL_TOKEN_HTML_TEMPLATE_NAME': &quot;mytemplate.html&quot;}```The template renders a single variable ``{{ callback_token }}`` which isthe 6 digit callback token being sent.Contact Point Validation========================Endpoints can automatically mark themselves as validated when a userlogs in with a token sent to a specific endpoint. They can alsoautomatically mark themselves as invalid when a user changes a contactpoint.This is off by default but can be turned on with``PASSWORDLESS_USER_MARK_EMAIL_VERIFIED`` or``PASSWORDLESS_USER_MARK_MOBILE_VERIFIED``. By default when these areenabled they look for the User model fields ``email_verified`` or``mobile_verified``.You can also use ``auth/verify/email/`` or ``/auth/verify/mobile/`` which willautomatically send a token to the endpoint attached to the current``request.user``'s email or mobile if available.You can then send that token to ``/auth/verify/`` which will double-checkthat the endpoint belongs to the request.user and mark the alias as verified.Registration============All unrecognized emails and mobile numbers create new accounts bydefault. New accounts are automatically set with``set_unusable_password()`` but it’s recommended that admins have sometype of password.This can be turned off with the ``PASSWORDLESS_REGISTER_NEW_USERS``setting.Other Settings==============Here’s a full list of the configurable defaults.```pythonDEFAULTS = {    # Allowed auth types, can be EMAIL, MOBILE, or both.
