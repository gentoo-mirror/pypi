	<longdescription>## mathy_pydoc**IMPORTANT** This is a fork of the pydoc_markdown repo to use the legacy version for Mathy's simple API doc needs. See the official repo for the latest stable updates: https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/pydoc-markdown&amp;ndash; _insipired by the [Keras] Documentation_## Installation    pip install mathy_pydoc## Usagemathy_pydoc generates plain Markdown files from Python modules using the`mathy_pydoc` command. Specify one or more module names on the command-line.Supports the `+` syntax to include members of the module (or `++` to includemembers of the members, etc.)    mathy_pydoc mypackage+ mypackage.mymodule+ &gt; docs.md## Syntax### Cross-referencesSymbols in the same namespace may be referenced by using a hash-symbol (`#`)directly followed by the symbols' name, including relative references. Note thatusing parentheses for function names is encouraged and will be ignored andautomatically added when converting docstrings. Examples: `#ClassName.member` or`#mod.function()`.For absolute references for modules or members in names that are not availablein the current global namespace, `#::mod.member` must be used (note the twopreceeding two double-colons).For long reference names where only some part of the name should be displayed,the syntax `#X~some.reference.name` can be used, where `X` is the number ofelements to keep. If `X` is omitted, it will be assumed 1. Example:`#~some.reference.name` results in only `name` being displayed.In order to append additional characters that are not included in the actualreference name, another hash-symbol can be used, like `#Signal#s`.### SectionsSections can be generated with the Markdown `# &lt;Title&gt;` syntax. It is importantto add a whitespace after the hash-symbol (`#`), as otherwise it would representa cross-reference. Some special sections alter the rendered result of theircontent, including- Arguments (1)- Parameters (1)- Attributes (1)- Members (1)- Raises (2)- Returns (2)(1): Lines beginning with `&lt;ident&gt; [(&lt;type&gt;[, ...])]:` are treated asargument/parameter or attribute/member declarations. Types listed inside theparenthesis (optional) are cross-linked, if possible. For attribute/memberdeclarations, the identifier is typed in a monospace font.(2): Lines beginning with `&lt;type&gt;[, ...]:` are treated as raise/return typedeclarations and the type names are cross-linked, if possible.Lines following a name's description are considered part of the most recentdocumentation unless separated by another declaration or an empty line. `&lt;type&gt;`placeholders can also be tuples in the form `(&lt;type&gt;[, ...])`.### Code BlocksGitHub-style Markdown code-blocks with language annotations can be used.    ```python    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(100):    ...    ```---</longdescription>
