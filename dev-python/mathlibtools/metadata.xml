	<longdescription># mathlib-tools![Test on Linux](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/workflows/Test%20on%20Linux/badge.svg)![Test on MacOS](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/workflows/Test%20on%20MacOS/badge.svg)![Test on Windows](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/workflows/Test%20on%20Windows/badge.svg)This package contains `leanproject`, a supporting tool for [Lean mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/).## InstallationIn principle, you should install those tools as part of the [global Lean installation procedure](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html#regular-install) recommended by the Lean community. Read what what remains of this section only if you want more detailsabout this specific part of the procedure (the tools described here won't giveyou anything if Lean itself is not available).### Released version#### `pipx`The tools in this repository use python3, at least python3.6, which is the oldest version of python supportedby the python foundation. They can be installed using[pip](https://pypi.org/project/mathlibtools/). The basic install commandfor the latest released version is thus:```bashpython3 -m pip install mathlibtools```The above command may complain about permissions. This can be solvedby running it as root, but this is not recommended in general. You canrun `python3 -m pip install --user mathlibtools` to install it in yourhome directory (make sure that `$HOME/.local/bin/` is on your shell pathafterwards), but an even better way is to use[pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/):```bashpython3 -m pip install --user pipxpython3 -m pipx ensurepathsource ~/.profilepipx install mathlibtools```#### `macOS`If you are on macOS, the recommended way to install is via homebrew,which will handle the above Python installation for you:```bashbrew install mathlibtools```#### `NixOS`If you are using NixOS, you can also install mathlib tools using thebundled `default.nix` file:```nix-env -if https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/archive/master.tar.gz```### Development versionIf you want to use the latest development version, you can clone thisrepository, go to the repository folder, and run `pip install .`.## UsageSee the [dedicated page](https://leanprover-community.github.io/leanproject.html) on the community website.</longdescription>
