It seeks to make algorithms explicit and data structures transparent. It works in perfect harmony with parallelisation mechanisms such as multiprocessing and [SCOOP](https://github.com/soravux/scoop).DEAP includes the following features:  * Genetic algorithm using any imaginable representation    * List, Array, Set, Dictionary, Tree, Numpy Array, etc.  * Genetic programming using prefix trees    * Loosely typed, Strongly typed    * Automatically defined functions  * Evolution strategies (including CMA-ES)  * Multi-objective optimisation (NSGA-II, NSGA-III, SPEA2, MO-CMA-ES)  * Co-evolution (cooperative and competitive) of multiple populations  * Parallelization of the evaluations (and more)  * Hall of Fame of the best individuals that lived in the population  * Checkpoints that take snapshots of a system regularly  * Benchmarks module containing most common test functions  * Genealogy of an evolution (that is compatible with [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx))  * Examples of alternative algorithms : Particle Swarm Optimization, Differential Evolution, Estimation of Distribution Algorithm## DownloadsFollowing acceptance of [PEP 438](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0438/) by the Python community, we have moved DEAP's source releases on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org).You can find the most recent releases at: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/deap/.## DocumentationSee the [DEAP User's Guide](http://deap.readthedocs.org/) for DEAP documentation.In order to get the tip documentation, change directory to the `doc` subfolder and type in `make html`, the documentation will be under `_build/html`. You will need [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org) to build the documentation.### NotebooksAlso checkout our new [notebook examples](https://github.com/DEAP/notebooks). Using [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org)  you'll be able to navigate and execute each block of code individually and tell what every line is doing. Either, look at the notebooks online using the notebook viewer links at the botom of the page or download the notebooks, navigate to the you download directory and run```bashjupyter notebook```## InstallationWe encourage you to use easy_install or pip to install DEAP on your system. Other installation procedure like apt-get, yum, etc. usually provide an outdated version.```bashpip install deap```The latest version can be installed with ```bashpip install git+https://github.com/DEAP/deap@master```If you wish to build from sources, download or clone the repository and type```bashpython setup.py install```## Build StatusDEAP build status is available on Travis-CI https://travis-ci.org/DEAP/deap.## RequirementsThe most basic features of DEAP requires Python2.6. In order to combine the toolbox and the multiprocessing module Python2.7 is needed for its support to pickle partial functions. CMA-ES requires Numpy, and we recommend matplotlib for visualization of results as it is fully compatible with DEAP's API.Since version 0.8, DEAP is compatible out of the box with Python 3. The installation procedure automatically translates the source to Python 3 with 2to3, however this requires having `setuptools&lt;=58`. It is recommended to use `pip install setuptools==57.5.0` to address this issue.## ExampleThe following code gives a quick overview how simple it is to implement the Onemax problem optimization with genetic algorithm using DEAP.  More examples are provided [here](http://deap.readthedocs.org/en/master/examples/index.html).```pythonimport randomfrom deap import creator, base, tools, algorithmscreator.create(&quot;FitnessMax&quot;, base.Fitness, weights=(1.0,))creator.create(&quot;Individual&quot;, list, fitness=creator.FitnessMax)toolbox = base.Toolbox()toolbox.register(&quot;attr_bool&quot;, random.randint, 0, 1)toolbox.register(&quot;individual&quot;, tools.initRepeat, creator.Individual, toolbox.attr_bool, n=100)toolbox.register(&quot;population&quot;, tools.initRepeat, list, toolbox.individual)def evalOneMax(individual):    return sum(individual),toolbox.register(&quot;evaluate&quot;, evalOneMax)toolbox.register(&quot;mate&quot;, tools.cxTwoPoint)toolbox.register(&quot;mutate&quot;, tools.mutFlipBit, indpb=0.05)toolbox.register(&quot;select&quot;, tools.selTournament, tournsize=3)population = toolbox.population(n=300)NGEN=40for gen in range(NGEN):    offspring = algorithms.varAnd(population, toolbox, cxpb=0.5, mutpb=0.1)    fits = toolbox.map(toolbox.evaluate, offspring)    for fit, ind in zip(fits, offspring):        ind.fitness.values = fit    population = toolbox.select(offspring, k=len(population))top10 = tools.selBest(population, k=10)```## How to cite DEAPAuthors of scientific papers including results generated using DEAP are encouraged to cite the following paper.```xml@article{DEAP_JMLR2012,     author    = &quot; F\'elix-Antoine Fortin and Fran\c{c}ois-Michel {De Rainville} and Marc-Andr\'e Gardner and Marc Parizeau and Christian Gagn\'e &quot;,    title     = { {DEAP}: Evolutionary Algorithms Made Easy },    pages    = { 2171--2175 },    volume    = { 13 },    month     = { jul },    year      = { 2012 },    journal   = { Journal of Machine Learning Research }}```## Publications on DEAP  * François-Michel De Rainville, Félix-Antoine Fortin, Marc-André Gardner, Marc Parizeau and Christian Gagné, &quot;DEAP -- Enabling Nimbler Evolutions&quot;, SIGEVOlution, vol. 6, no 2, pp. 17-26, February 2014.
