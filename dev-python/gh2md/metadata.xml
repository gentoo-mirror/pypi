	<longdescription>gh2md=====|PyPI|Export issues and pull requests for a Github repository to a readable markdownfile. You can either create a single file for the repo, or a directory with onefile per issue. See usage instructions for how to filter by issue type and state.There are various other projects that handle Github issue exports(Eg. `offline-issues &lt;https://github.com/jlord/offline-issues&gt;`_), but Icouldn't find one that writes all issues, comments and metadata to a singlereadable file.Example exports---------------An example exported file is included in the `examples directory&lt;examples/sshrc.md&gt;`_. There is also an `example directory with one issue perfile &lt;examples/gh2md-multiple-files-example&gt;`_Default behaviour is to export all issues and PRs.Usage-----Run export for ``paulirish/git-open``, pulling token from environment, and excluding closed PRs:::    export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=myAPItoken    gh2md paulirish/git-open git-open.md --no-closed-prsRun export for ``shezadkhan137/required``, pulling token from file, and excluding closed issues:::    echo myAPItoken &gt; ~/.config/gh2md/token    gh2md shezadkhan137/required required.md --no-closed-issuesRun export for public repository ``sarabander/sicp``, using no authentication and one file per issue:::    gh2md sarabander/sicp sicp-issues --multiple-files --no-closed-prs Full help::    usage: gh2md [-h] [--multiple-files] [-I] [--no-prs] [--no-closed-prs]                [--no-issues] [--no-closed-issues]                [--file-extension FILE_EXTENSION]                repo output_path    Export Github repository issues, pull requests and comments to markdown files:    https://github.com/mattduck/gh2md    Example: gh2md mattduck/gh2md my_issues.md    Credentials are resolved in the following order:    - A `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.    - An API token stored in ~/.config/gh2md/token or ~/.github-token.    To access private repositories, you'll need a token with the full &quot;repo&quot; oauth    scope.    By default, all issues and pull requests will be fetched. You can disable these    using the --no... flags, eg. --no-closed-prs, or --no-prs.    positional arguments:    repo                  Github repo to export, in format &quot;owner/repo_name&quot;.    output_path           Path to write exported issues.    optional arguments:    -h, --help            show this help message and exit    --multiple-files      Instead of one file, treat the given path as a                            directory, and create one file per issue, using a                            format '{created_at}.{issue_number}.{issue_type}.{issu                            e_state}{file_extension}'.    -I, --idempotent      Remove non-deterministic values like timestamps. Two                            runs of gh2md will always produce the same result, as                            long as the Github data has not changed.    --no-prs              Don't include pull requests in the export.    --no-closed-prs       Don't include closed pull requests in the export.    --no-issues           Don't include issues in the export.    --no-closed-issues    Don't include closed issues in the export.    --file-extension FILE_EXTENSION                            File extension for output files. Default is '.md'.Install-------``pip install gh2md``. Alternatively, clone the repository and run ``make install``.Authentication---------------``gh2md`` requires a Github access token to authenticate requests. To read yourprivate repositories, you'll need to provide a personal access token with fullthe full **repo** oauth scope.**It's not possible to authenticate with a username and password**. Github usedto support this, but it was discontinued in 2020.Github workflow: backup issues as a markdown file in your repo--------------------------------------------------------------`@0ut0fcontrol &lt;https://github.com/0ut0fcontrol&gt;`_ contributed a github workflowthat uses ``gh2md`` to run a nightly export to ``issues.md``, and push it back toyour repo. You can find the thread and workflow code `here&lt;https://github.com/mattduck/gh2md/issues/11&gt;`_.This has been added to the ``gh2md`` repo itself, so you can see an up-to-dateexport in `issues.md &lt;./issues.md&gt;`_... |PyPI| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/gh2md.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gh2md</longdescription>
