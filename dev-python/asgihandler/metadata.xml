	<longdescription>ðŸ“¦ setup.py (for humans)=======================This repo exists to provide [an example setup.py] file, that can be usedto bootstrap your next Python project. It includes some advancedpatterns and best practices for `setup.py`, as well as somecommentedâ€“out niceâ€“toâ€“haves.For example, this `setup.py` provides a `$ python setup.py upload`command, which creates a *universal wheel* (and *sdist*) and uploadsyour package to [PyPi] using [Twine], without the need for an annoying`setup.cfg` file. It also creates/uploads a new git tag, automatically.In short, `setup.py` files can be daunting to approach, when firststarting out â€” even Guido has been heard saying, &quot;everyone cargo cultsthems&quot;. It's true â€” so, I want this repo to be the best place tocopyâ€“paste from :)[Check out the example!][an example setup.py]Installation-----```bashcd your_project# Download the setup.py file:#  download with wgetwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/navdeep-G/setup.py/master/setup.py -O setup.py#  download with curlcurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/navdeep-G/setup.py/master/setup.py```To Do------   Tests via `$ setup.py test` (if it's concise).Pull requests are encouraged!More Resources---------------   [What is setup.py?] on Stack Overflow-   [Official Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org)-   [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Packaging]-   [Cookiecutter template for a Python package]License-------This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, ordistribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiledbinary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.
