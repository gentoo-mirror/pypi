This is not required if installing a prebuilt package from acc-py or pypi.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Windows&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;On Windows computers `MSVC &gt;= 14.0 &lt;https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&gt;`_with the Windows 10 SDK is required.In MinGW and WSL environments the standard `g++` compiler works out of the box.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;MacOS&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;No offical tests have been done on MacOS, but presumably `g++`, `clang`/`llvm` should work.Install=======The Longitudinal Tomography package is available in prebuilt wheels for Python 3.6-3.9on CERN Acc-Py and pypy.org as `longitudinal-tomography`. The package can thus easily be installed ona Linux machine using::    pip install longitudinal-tomographyThe package can be installed on a MacOS or Windows machine in the same manner, but theC++ extension will be built on install.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Other ways to install&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Clone the repository and run::   pip install .The C++ extension will be built on install.For development environments where it's preferable to compile the C++ extension inplace, it's possible to run the command::    pip install -e .which will compile the C++ extension using the available compiler (decided by setuptools).&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Documentation&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;This development is based on the well tested and widely used FORTRAN95 code, documented and available here: http://tomograp.web.cern.ch/tomograp/Details on the algorithms in both codes, and the differences between them, can be found here: https://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/2750116?ln=kaParallelization using OpenMP============================The C++ extension is accelerated by OpenMP parallel for loops. It is possible to limit the number of launched threadsby setting it in the extension, by::    from longitudinal_tomography.cpp_routines import libtomo    libtomo.set_num_threads([num_threads])which will set the maximum number of used threads to :code:`[num_threads]`.</longdescription>
