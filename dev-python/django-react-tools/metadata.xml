	<longdescription>![Upload Python Package](https://github.com/renderbox/django-react-tools/workflows/Upload%20Python%20Package/badge.svg)# django-react-toolsTools for helping integrate ReactJS into a Django project.The current iteration of this tool adds a simple management command to your Django project that will build, copy to a Django static directory and rename accordingly.If you wish to contribute, please Fork the repo and then make a Pull Request.  We're always open for people who want to help make this a better package.To start run ```bashpip install django-react-tools```then add 'reacttools' to your django project's list of apps.next in settings, set where to find the React project:```pythonREACT_PROJECT_DIRECTORY = &quot;/path/to/project&quot;```The default destination location is the Static Root directory for your Django project.  You can change it by modifying the setting variable.```pythonREACT_DJANGO_DEST = settings.STATIC_ROOT```To run all you need to do is call the management command.```bash&gt; ./manage.py collectreact```By default the React project is buit using &quot;yarn build&quot;.  If you want to change the command you can:```pythonREACT_BUILD_COMMAND = &quot;npm build&quot;```If you want to skip the build you can run the comman this way:```bash&gt; ./manage.py collectreact --no-build```</longdescription>
