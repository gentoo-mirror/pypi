Feel free to have a poke about, but don't be surprised if itdoesn't make much sense.At the present time not only should you not use this package, our authentication will also prevent it.Usage-----To construct NDJSON for Bulk API calls:```pythonfrom h_api.enums import ViewTypefrom h_api.bulk_api import CommandBuilder, BulkAPI, Executornd_json = BulkAPI.to_string([    # It's your job to put the right commands here.     # This also accepts a generator    CommandBuilder.configure(        effective_user=&quot;acct:example@lms.hypothes.is&quot;,         total_instructions=4,         view=ViewType.BASIC),    CommandBuilder.user.upsert({        &quot;username&quot;: &quot;username&quot;,        &quot;authority&quot;: &quot;authority&quot;,        &quot;display_name&quot;: &quot;display_name&quot;,        &quot;identities&quot;: [{            &quot;provider&quot;: &quot;provider&quot;,            &quot;provider_unique_id&quot;: &quot;provider_unique_id&quot;        }],    }, &quot;user_ref&quot;),    CommandBuilder.group.upsert({        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;name&quot;,        &quot;authority&quot;: &quot;authority&quot;,        &quot;authority_provided_id&quot;: &quot;authority_provided_id&quot;    }, &quot;group_ref&quot;),        # These references here match those we assigned to the objects above    CommandBuilder.group_membership.create(&quot;user_ref&quot;, &quot;group_ref&quot;)])# It's now your job to send this off to H```To accept and process an NDJSON request like the above:```pythonclass MyExectutor(Executor):    def execute_batch(self, command_type, data_type, default_config, batch):        &quot;&quot;&quot;Implement your insertion logic here and return Report Objects&quot;&quot;&quot;        rows = BulkAPI.from_byte_stream(http_streaming_body, executor=MyExectutor())if rows:    # Turn each row into JSON and return to your caller    # You have to do this```## Setting up Your h-api Development EnvironmentFirst you'll need to install:* [Git](https://git-scm.com/).  On Ubuntu: `sudo apt install git`, on macOS: `brew install git`.* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).  This is probably already installed, run `make --version` to check.* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).  Follow the instructions in pyenv's README to install it.  The **Homebrew** method works best on macOS.  The **Basic GitHub Checkout** method works best on Ubuntu.  You _don't_ need to set up pyenv's shell integration (&quot;shims&quot;), you can  [use pyenv without shims](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#using-pyenv-without-shims).Then to set up your development environment:```terminalgit clone https://github.com/hypothesis/h-api.gitcd h_apimake help```## Releasing a New Version of the Project1. First, to get PyPI publishing working you need to go to:   &lt;https://github.com/organizations/hypothesis/settings/secrets/actions/PYPI_TOKEN&gt;   and add h-api to the `PYPI_TOKEN` secret's selected   repositories.2. Now that the h-api project has access to the `PYPI_TOKEN` secret   you can release a new version by just [creating a new GitHub release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository).   Publishing a new GitHub release will automatically trigger   [a GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/pypi.yml)   that will build the new version of your Python package and upload it to   &lt;https://pypi.org/project/h-api&gt;.## Changing the Project's Python VersionsTo change what versions of Python the project uses:1. Change the Python versions in the   [cookiecutter.json](.cookiecutter/cookiecutter.json) file. For example:   ```json   &quot;python_versions&quot;: &quot;3.10.4, 3.9.12&quot;,   ```2. Re-run the cookiecutter template:   ```terminal   make template   ```3. Commit everything to git and send a pull request## Changing the Project's Python DependenciesTo change the production dependencies in the `setup.cfg` file:1. Change the dependencies in the [`.cookiecutter/includes/setuptools/install_requires`](.cookiecutter/includes/setuptools/install_requires) file.   If this file doesn't exist yet create it and add some dependencies to it.   For example:   ```   pyramid   sqlalchemy   celery   ```2. Re-run the cookiecutter template:   ```terminal   make template   ```3. Commit everything to git and send a pull requestTo change the project's formatting, linting and test dependencies:1. Change the dependencies in the [`.cookiecutter/includes/tox/deps`](.cookiecutter/includes/tox/deps) file.   If this file doesn't exist yet create it and add some dependencies to it.   Use tox's [factor-conditional settings](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/config.html#factors-and-factor-conditional-settings)   to limit which environment(s) each dependency is used in.   For example:   ```   lint: flake8,   format: autopep8,   lint,tests: pytest-faker,   ```2. Re-run the cookiecutter template:   ```terminal   make template   ```3. Commit everything to git and send a pull request</longdescription>
