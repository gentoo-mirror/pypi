Branches include **main**, **osx**, **fiat**, **osx-fiat**, **pip**, **windows**. The exception is that we did not include the scrtsxx.py which contains credentials for the FIAT gateway. Please navigate the various branches to understand the different interworkings. ## Mac OS XDownload the latest release [Mac OS X v1.5.1](https://github.com/MathNodes/meile-gui/releases/)### NOTE:pip install is not currently available for Mac OS X. We are working on bringing this as a separate packages. ## Debian .deb packageThe latest version of Meile GUI comes packaged as a Debian archive. Simply download the latest release: [https://github.com/MathNodes/meile-gui/releases/](https://github.com/MathNodes/meile-gui/releases/)and run:```shellsudo apt install -y ./meile-gui-v1.0.1_amd64.deb```This release will install wireguard tools (and resolvconf) alongside Meile GUI. To run the application requires root privileges on some machines and we have enforced it within the app.```shellmeile-gui```Or goto your panel menu under Internet and there will be a clickable icon. ## Debian Virtual Machine (.deb)Because there were issues loading certain mesa OpenGL drivers in various Debian Virtual Machines, we have included a separate .deb archive that automatically configures the system to handle the Meile dependencies. Please use this version if you are running a Debian flavor in a virutal machine (VM).[Debian/Ubuntu 20.04 Virtual Machine](https://github.com/MathNodes/meile-gui/releases)## Redhat/CentOS/Fedora (.rpm)Download the latest RPM for RedHat releases:[RedHat RPM](https://github.com/MathNodes/meile-gui/releases/)Install the rpm from a terminal:```shellsudo rpm -i meile-gui-1.5.1-1.fc36.x86_64.rpm```This will install `meile-gui` and all its dependencies. ## Installing via pipMeile dVPN GUI v0.9.3-beta is now available as a pip packages as well. To install, first install wireguard-tools and meile dependencies if you don't already have them```sudo apt install -y  wireguard-tools openresolv mesa-utils libgl1-mesa-glx xclip```Then install via pip```shellpip3 install meile-gui```Upgrade via pip```shellpip3 install meile-gui --upgrade```To run Meile GUI after pip install do the following:```shellmeile-gui```### NOTE:The FIAT gateway is not included in the pip package. This is due to certain credentials needing to remain secret for OPSEC reasons. The pip package will continue to get updated with the FIAT release in bug fixes and feature additions. Please make comments, suggestions, and issues on the issues page here at GitHub. If you are a GitHub newb, you can join us on our Telegram [MathNodes-Telegram](http://t.me/MathNodes) or our Discord [MathNodes-Discord](https://discord.gg/HQrHXZJHQq) in the Meile channel. All suggestions are welcome.## Creating a Binary for your distribution:In order to create a binary for your distribution some packages need to be installed first.Pyinstaller:```shellpip3 install pyinstaller```Install a python virtualenv:```shellsudo apt install python3-virtualenv```Then clone the repo:```shellgit clone https://github.com/MathNodes/meile-gui```Switch to the pip branch as this is the one without FIAT gateway```cd meile-gui &amp;&amp; git checkout pip```Then run a python virtual environment and install meile-gui. This will find all the dependencies for **meile-gui**.```shellpython3 -m venv meile-gui &amp;&amp; \source meile-gui/bin/activate &amp;&amp; \ pip install -e .```Once meile-gui and it's dependencies have been installed within the python virutal environment, a binary release can be created:```bash pyinstaller.cmd```That's it. Navigate to the `dist` folder where the binary will be. # DonationsBecause we are working on a small grant with no VC funding, any additional contributions to our developer team is more than certainly welcomed. It will help fund future releases. ## DVPN (Sentinel)`sent12v8ghhg98e2n0chyje3su4uqlsg75sh4lwcyww`![dvpn](./img/DVPN.png)## XMR (Monero)`87qHJPU5dZGWaWzuoC3My5SgoQSuxh4sHSv1FXRZrQ9XZHWnfC33EX1NLv5HujpVhbPbbF9RcXXD94byT18HonAQ75b9dyR`![xmr](./img/XMR.png)</longdescription>
