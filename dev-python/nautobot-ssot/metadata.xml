This plugin facilitates integration and data synchronization between various &quot;source of truth&quot; (SoT) systems, with Nautobot acting as a central clearinghouse for data - a Single Source of Truth, if you will.The nautobot-ssot plugin builds atop the [DiffSync](https://github.com/networktocode/diffsync) Python library and Nautobot's Jobs feature. This enables the rapid development and integration of Jobs that can be run within Nautobot to pull data from other systems (&quot;Data Sources&quot;) into Nautobot and/or push data from Nautobot into other systems (&quot;Data Targets&quot;) as desired. Key features include the following:* A dashboard UI lists all registered Data Sources and Data Targets and provides a summary of the synchronization history.* The outcome of executing of a data synchronization Job is automatically saved to Nautobot's database for later review.* Detailed logging output generated by DiffSync is automatically captured and saved to the database as well.### Screenshots---The dashboard view of the app.![Dashboard View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-ssot/develop/docs/images/dashboard_initial.png)---The detailed view of the example data source that is prepackaged within this app.![Data Source Detail View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-ssot/develop/docs/images/data_source_detail.png)---The detailed view of an executed sync.![Sync Detail View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-ssot/develop/docs/images/sync_detail.png)---More screenshots can be found in the [Using the App](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/ssot/en/latest/user/app_use_cases/) page in the documentation.## Try it out!This App is installed in the Nautobot Community Sandbox found over at [demo.nautobot.com](https://demo.nautobot.com/)!&gt; For a full list of all the available always-on sandbox environments, head over to the main page on [networktocode.com](https://www.networktocode.com/nautobot/sandbox-environments/).## DocumentationFull documentation for this App can be found over on the [Nautobot Docs](https://docs.nautobot.com) website:- [User Guide](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/ssot/en/latest/user/app_overview/) - Overview, Using the App, Getting Started, Developing Jobs.- [Administrator Guide](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/ssot/en/latest/admin/install/) - How to Install, Configure, Upgrade, or Uninstall the App.- [Developer Guide](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/ssot/en/latest/dev/contributing/) - Extending the App, Code Reference, Contribution Guide.- [Release Notes / Changelog](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/ssot/en/latest/admin/release_notes/).### Contributing to the DocumentationYou can find all the Markdown source for the App documentation under the [`docs`](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-ssot//tree/develop/docs) folder in this repository.
