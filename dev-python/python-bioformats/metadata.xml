	<longdescription>Python-bioformats is a Python wrapper for Bio-Formats, a standalone Java library for reading    and writing life sciences image file formats. Bio-Formats is capable of parsing both pixels and metadata for a    large number of formats, as well as writing to several formats. Python-bioformats uses the python-javabridge to    start a Java virtual machine from Python and interact with it. Python-bioformats was developed for and is used by    the cell image analysis software CellProfiler (cellprofiler.org).  While we are gratified that others    outside the CellProfiler team find it useful, we maintain python-bioformats essentially for the CellProfiler project     and **cannot currently guarantee support for other users.** Please consider visiting our forum at forum.image.sc for     additional support help.</longdescription>
