	<longdescription>Pyap: Python address parser===========================Pyap is an MIT Licensed text processing library, written in Python, fordetecting and parsing addresses. Currently it supports US ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, Canadian ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ and British ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ addresses. .. code-block:: python    &gt;&gt;&gt; import pyap    &gt;&gt;&gt; test_address = &quot;&quot;&quot;        Lorem ipsum        225 E. John Carpenter Freeway,         Suite 1500 Irving, Texas 75062        Dorem sit amet        &quot;&quot;&quot;    &gt;&gt;&gt; addresses = pyap.parse(test_address, country='US')    &gt;&gt;&gt; for address in addresses:            # shows found address            print(address)            # shows address parts            print(address.as_dict())    ...Installation------------To install Pyap, simply:.. code-block:: bash    $ pip install pyapAbout-----This library has been created because i couldn't find any reliable andopensource solution for detecting addresses on web pages when writing myweb crawler. Currently available solutions have drawbacks when it comesto using them to process really large amounts of data fast. You'lleither have to buy some proprietary software; use third-partypay-per-use services or use address detecting which is slow andunsuitable for real-time processing.Pyap is an alternative to all these methods. It is really fast becauseit is based on using regular expressions and it allows to find addressesin text in real time with low error rates.Future work------------ Add rules for parsing FR addresses- ...Typical workflow----------------Pyap should be used as a first thing when you need to detect an addressinside a text when you don't know for sure whether the text containsaddresses or not.To achieve the most accuracy Pyap results could be reverified usinggeocoding process.Limitations-----------Because Pyap is based on regular expressions it provides fast results.This is also a limitation because regexps intentionally do not use toomuch context to detect an address.In other words in order to detect US address, the library doesn'tuse any list of US cities or a list of typical street names. Itlooks for a pattern which is most likely to be an address.For example the string below would be detected as a valid address: &quot;1 SPIRITUAL HEALER DR SHARIF NSAMBU SPECIALISING IN&quot;It happens because this string has all the components of a validaddress: street number &quot;1&quot;, street name &quot;SPIRITUAL HEALER&quot; followedby a street identifier &quot;DR&quot; (Drive), city &quot;SHARIF NSAMBU SPECIALISING&quot;and a state name abbreviation &quot;IN&quot; (Indiana).The good news is that the above mentioned errors are **quite rare**.</longdescription>
