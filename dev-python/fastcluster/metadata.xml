	<longdescription>This library provides Python functions for hierarchical clustering. Itgenerates hierarchical clusters from distance matrices or from vector data.This module is intended to replace the functions```    linkage, single, complete, average, weighted, centroid, median, ward```in the module [`scipy.cluster.hierarchy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/cluster.hierarchy.html) with the samefunctionality but much faster algorithms. Moreover, the function`linkage_vector` provides memory-efficient clustering for vector data.The interface is very similar to MATLAB's Statistics Toolbox API to make codeeasier to port from MATLAB to Python/NumPy. The core implementation of thislibrary is in C++ for efficiency.**User manual:** [fastcluster.pdf](https://github.com/dmuellner/fastcluster/raw/master/docs/fastcluster.pdf).The “Yule” distance function changed in fastcluster version 1.2.0. This isfollowing a [change in SciPy 1.6.3](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/commit/3b22d1da98dc1b5f64bc944c21f398d4ba782bce).It is recommended to use fastcluster version 1.1.x together with SciPy versionsbefore 1.6.3 and fastcluster 1.2.x with SciPy ≥1.6.3.The fastcluster package is considered stable and will undergo few changesfrom now on. If some years from now there have not been any updates, this doesnot necessarily mean that the package is unmaintained but maybe it just wasnot necessary to correct anything. Of course, please still report potentialbugs and incompatibilities to daniel@danifold.net. You may also use[my GitHub repository](https://github.com/dmuellner/fastcluster/)for bug reports, pull requests etc.Note that [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fastcluster/) and [my GitHubrepository](https://github.com/dmuellner/fastcluster/) host the source codefor the Python interface only. The archive with both the R and the Pythoninterface is available on[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fastcluster) and the GitHub repository[“cran/fastcluster”](https://github.com/cran/fastcluster). Even though I appearas the author also of this second GitHub repository, this is just an automatic,read-only mirror of the CRAN archive, so please do not attempt to report bugs orcontact me via this repository.Installation files for Windows are provided on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fastcluster/#files) and on [Christoph Gohlke's webpage](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fastcluster).Christoph Dalitz wrote a pure [C++ interface to fastcluster](https://lionel.kr.hs-niederrhein.de/~dalitz/data/hclust/).Reference: Daniel Müllner, *fastcluster: Fast Hierarchical, AgglomerativeClustering Routines for R and Python*, Journal of Statistical Software, **53**(2013), no. 9, 1–18, https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v053.i09.</longdescription>
