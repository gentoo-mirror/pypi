	<longdescription>McRoss is a minimal and usable [gemini://](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/)browser written in python and tkinter, meaning it Just Works (tm) on anyself-respecting desktop OS. I use and test it on Linux &amp; Windows, but it shouldalso run fine on macOS or any of the BSDs.It currently looks like this:![](https://junk.imnhan.com/mcross.png)Surfing plaintext and gemini content is already working well. The catch is itcurrently doesn't support downloading binary content and TOFU TLS verification.See feature checklist below for more details.See my [blog post][1] for the rationale behind this project.# InstallationDependencies are:+ python3.7++ tkinter+ idlelib`idlelib` is supposed to be included in the standard library but some linuxdistros split it into a separate package which you'll need to install manually.I know at least [Ubuntu and Void Linux][2] do this.## On Ubuntu:```shsudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-tk idle3pip3 install --user mcross# make sure ~/.local/bin is in $PATH first of coursemcross```## On Arch:```shsudo pacman -S python tkpip install --user mcross```Also consider using [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx) for a cleaner,better isolated installation.Better distribution methods to be explored later.Maybe it's finally time to try nuitka?# UsageRun `mcross -h` to get a full list of CLI arguments. The same arguments canalso be defined in a TOML config file: run `mcross-info` to know where thisfile should be for your OS. For example, running mcross like this:```shmcross --background-color pink -t &quot;Ubuntu&quot;```is the same as putting this in `$HOME/.config/mcross/mcross.toml` for linux:```tomlbackground-color = &quot;pink&quot;text-font = &quot;Ubuntu&quot;```The priority is CLI arg &gt; config file &gt; default.Keyboard shortcuts:- `Ctrl-l`: jump to address bar.- Hold `Alt` to see possible button shortcuts underlined. This is what Qt calls  [Accelerator Keys](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/accelerators.html).# DevelopmentTo get started:```shpyenv install 3.7.7pyenv virtualenv 3.7.7 mcrosspyenv activatepoetry installmcross# to publish, first bump version in pyproject.toml thenpoetry publish --build```There are 2 McRoss-related mailing lists:- [~nhanb/mcross-devel](https://lists.sr.ht/~nhanb/mcross-devel): discuss and  submit your patches here- [~nhanb/mcross-announce](https://lists.sr.ht/~nhanb/mcross-announce):  low-volume announcement-only listIf you're not familiar with the mailing list workflow, check out[git-send-email.io][3] and [mailing list etiquette][4]. [useplaintext.email][5]also has useful plaintext setup tips for various email clients, though I don'tnecessarily agree with its &quot;plaintext or nothing&quot; stance.# Feature checklist- [x] back-forward buttons- [x] handle redirects- [x] non-blocking I/O using curio- [x] more visual indicators: waiting cursor, status bar- [x] parse gemini's advanced line types- [x] render `text/*` mime types with correct charset- [ ] handle `binary/*` mime types- [x] configurable document styling- [ ] human-friendly distribution- [ ] TOFU TLS (right now it always accepts self-signed certs)Long term high-level goals:## Easy for end users to installIf the words `cargo build` exists in the installation guide for your G U Iapplication then I'm sorry it's not software made for people to _use_.## What-you-see-is-what-you-writeA rendered text/gemini viewport should preserve its original text content.This way once you've read a gemini page on the browser, you already know how towrite one. No &quot;View Source&quot; necessary.## Responsive &amp; pleasant to useThe Castor browser doesn't have visual indicators at all, for example, whenclicking on a link it just appears to do nothing until the new page iscompletely loaded. That is A Bad Thing (tm).## LightweightIn terms of both disk space &amp; memory/cpu usage.The python/tkinter combo already puts us at a pretty good starting point.# Server bugs/surprises## Forces gemini:// in requestSpec says protocol part is optional, but if I omit that one the server willrespond with `53 No proxying to other hosts!`.## NewlineSpec says a newline should be \r\n but the server runninggemini.circumlunar.space just uses \n every time.# LicenseCopyright (C) 2020 Bùi Thành NhânThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it underthe terms of the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 as published bythe Free Software Foundation.This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANYWARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR APARTICULAR PURPOSE.
