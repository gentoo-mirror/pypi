	<longdescription># beancount-parser [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/LaunchPlatform/beancount-parser/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/LaunchPlatform/beancount-parser/tree/master)Standalone [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) LALR(1) based Beancount syntax parser (not relying on Beancount library), MIT licensePlease also checkout out [beancount-black](https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beancount-black), an opinionated beancount code formatter based on beancount-parser.## Features- **MIT licensed** - the only dependency is [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark)- **Extremely fast** - LALR(1) is used- **Section awareness** - emac org symbol mark `*` will be parsed- **Comment awareness** - comments will be parsed- **Not a validator** - it does not validate beancount syntax, invalid beancount syntax may still pass the parsing# SponsorThe original project beancount-parser was meant to be an internal tool built by [Launch Platform LLC](https://launchplatform.com) for &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://beanhub.io&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beancount-black/raw/master/assets/beanhub.svg?raw=true&quot; alt=&quot;BeanHub logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A modern accounting book service based on the most popular open source version control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and text-based double entry accounting book software [Beancount](https://beancount.github.io/docs/index.html).We realized adding new entries with BeanHub automatically over time makes beancount file a mess.So obviously, a strong code formatter is needed.And to deal with comments and other corner cases, it's easier to build a parser from ground up without relying on Beancount.While SaaS businesses won't be required to open source an internal tool like this, we still love that the service is only possible because of the open-source tool we are using.We think it would be greatly beneficial for the community to access a tool like this, so we've decided to open source it under MIT license, hope you find this tool useful ðŸ˜„## InstallTo install the parser, simply run```bashpip install beancount-parser```## UsageIf you want to run the parse beancount code, you can do this```pythonimport iofrom beancount_parser.parser import make_parserparser = make_parser()tree = parser.parse(beancount_content)# do whatever you want with the tree here```## FeedbacksFeedbacks, bugs reporting or feature requests are welcome ðŸ™Œ, just please open an issue.No guarantee we have time to deal with them, but will see what we can do.</longdescription>
