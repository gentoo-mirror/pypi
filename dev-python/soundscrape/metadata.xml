SoundScrape!SoundScrape |Build Status| |Python 3| |PyPI|============================================**SoundScrape** makes it super easy to download artists from SoundCloud(and Bandcamp and MixCloud) - even those which don't have downloadlinks! It automatically creates ID3 tags as well (including album art),which is handy.Usage-----First, install it:.. code:: bash    pip install soundscrapeNote that if you are having problems, please first try updating to thelatest version:.. code:: bash    pip install soundscrape --upgradeThen, just call soundscrape and the name of the artist you want toscrape:.. code:: bash    soundscrape rabbit-i-amAnd you're done! Hooray! Files are stored as mp3s in the format **Artistname - Track title.mp3**.You can also use the *-n* argument to only download a certain number ofsongs... code:: bash    soundscrape rabbit-i-am -n 3Sets----Soundscrape can also download sets, but you have to include the full URLof the set you want to download:.. code:: bash    soundscrape https://soundcloud.com/vsauce-awesome/sets/awesomeGroups------Soundscrape can also download tracks from SoundCloud groups with the*-g* argument... code:: bash    soundscrape chopped-and-screwed -gn 2Tracks------Soundscrape can also download specific tracks with *-t*:.. code:: bash    soundscrape foolsgoldrecs -t danny-brown-dipor with just the straight URL:.. code:: bash    soundscrape https://soundcloud.com/foolsgoldrecs/danny-brown-dipLikes-----Soundscrape can also download all of an Artist's Liked items with *-l*:.. code:: bash    soundscrape troyboi -lor with just the straight URL:.. code:: bash    soundscrape https://soundcloud.com/troyboi/likesHigh-Quality Downloads Only---------------------------By default, SoundScrape will try to rip everything it can. However, ifyou only want to download tracks that have an official downloadavailable (which are typically at a higher-quality 320kbps bitrate), youcan use the *-d* argument... code:: bash    soundscrape sly-dogg -dKeep Preview Tracks-------------------By default, SoundScrape will skip the 30-second preview tracks thatSoundCloud now provides. You can choose to keep these preview snippetswith the *-k* argument... code:: bash    soundscrape chromeo -kFolders-------By default, SoundScrape aims to act like *wget*, downloading in place inthe current directory. With the *-f* argument, however, SoundScrape actsmore like a download manager and sorts songs into the following format:::    ./ARTIST_NAME - ALBUM_NAME/SONG_NUMBER - SONG_TITLE.mp3It will also skip previously downloaded tracks... code:: bash    soundscrape murdercitydevils -fBandcamp--------SoundScrape can also pull down albums from Bandcamp. For Bandcamp pages,use the *-b* argument along with an artist's username or a specific URL.It only downloads one album at a time. This works with all of the otherarguments, except *-d* as Bandcamp streams only come at one bitrate, asfar as I can tell.Note: Currently, when using the *-n* argument, the limit is evaluatedfor each album separately... code:: bash    soundscrape warsaw -b -fThis also works for non-Bandcamp URLs that are hosted on Bandcamp:.. code:: bash    soundscrape -b http://music.monstercat.com/Note that the full URL must be included.Mixcloud--------SoundScrape can also grab mixes from Mixcloud. This feature is extremelyexpermental and is in no way guaranteed to work!Finds the original mp3 of a mix and grabs that (with tags and album art)if it can, or else just gets the raw m4a stream.Mixcloud currently only takes an invidiual mix. Capacity for a wholeartist's profile due shortly... code:: bash    soundscrape https://www.mixcloud.com/corenewsuploads/flume-essential-mix-2015-10-03/ -ofAudiomack---------Just for fun, SoundScrape can also download individual songs fromAudiomack. Not that you'd ever want to... code:: bash    soundscrape -a http://www.audiomack.com/song/bottomfeedermusic/top-shottasMusicBed--------For some strange reason, it also works for MusicBed.com. Thanks @brachnafor this feature... code:: bash    soundscrape https://www.musicbed.com/albums/be-still/2828Opening Files-------------As a convenience method, SoundScrape can automatically *'open'* filesthat it downloads. This uses your system's 'open' command for fileassociations... code:: bash    soundscrape lorn -ofIssues------There's probably a lot more that can be done to improve this. Pleasefile issues if you find them!.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/Miserlou/SoundScrape.svg   :target: https://travis-ci.org/Miserlou/SoundScrape.. |Python 3| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3-brightgreen.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/soundscrape/.. |PyPI| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/soundscrape.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SoundScrape</longdescription>
