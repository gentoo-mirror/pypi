	<longdescription># CPA - Compositional Perturbation Autoencoder## What is CPA?![Alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33202701/156530222-c61e5982-d063-461c-b66e-c4591d2d0de4.png?raw=true &quot;Title&quot;)`CPA` is a framework to learn effects of perturbations at the single-cell level. CPA encodes and learns phenotypic drug response across different cell types, doses and drug combinations. CPA allows:* Out-of-distribution predictions of unseen drug combinations at various doses and among different cell types.* Learn interpretable drug and cell type latent spaces.* Estimate dose response curve for each perturbation and their combinations.* Access the uncertainty of the estimations of the model.Usage and installation-------------------------------See [here](https://cpa-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for documentation and tutorials.Support and contribute-------------------------------If you have a question or new architecture or a model that could be integrated into our pipeline, you canpost an [issue](https://github.com/theislab/cpa/issues/new)</longdescription>
