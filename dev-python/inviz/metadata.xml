	<longdescription># InVizInViz (Interactive Visualizer) is a tool to aid likelihood analysis of model parameters where samples from a distribution in the parameter space are used as inputs to calculate a given observable. For example, selecting a range of samples will allow you to easily see how the observables change as you traverse the sample distribution. At the core of InViz is the `Observable` object, which contains the data for a given observable and instructions for plotting it. It is modular, so you can write your own function that takes the parameter values as inputs, and InViz will use it to compute observables on the fly. It also accepts tabular data, so if you have pre-computed observables, simply import them alongside the dataset containing the sample distribution to start visualizing!## Installation### Dependencies- Python versions $\geq$ 3.8 and $&lt;$ 3.11 are supported.- Holoviews $\geq$ 1.15.4 (this package and its dependencies will be installed automatically)- Bokeh 2.4.3InViz can be installed with pip:    python -m pip install invizOr, if you want to test the latest changes, you can clone the repository with    git clone https://github.com/wen-jams/inviz    cd inviz    python setup.py install## Getting Started### Test InstallationTo verify that inviz and all the dependencies have been installed correctly, try running:    import inviz as ivIf no errors appear, all the dependencies were installed correctly and we're ready to start visualizing!### ExampleDownload and run the `live_data_example` notebook in the [tutorials](tutorials) folder to see an example of how inviz can be used.Here's InViz being used in an astrophysics context! The parameters come from a cosmological model of dark matter, and the observables are the matter and CMB power spectra.![example output](images/example3.png)## ContributingMake feature requests and bug reports using the issue tracker: &lt;https://github.com/wen-jams/inviz/issues&gt;## LicenseMIT License## Contact&lt;jimmywen74@gmail.com&gt;</longdescription>
