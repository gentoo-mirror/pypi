	<longdescription># Notebook ShimThis project provides a way for JupyterLab and other frontends to switch to [Jupyter Server](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/) for their Python Web application backend.## Basic UsageInstall from PyPI:```pip install notebook_shim```This will automatically enable the extension in Jupyter Server.## UsageThis project also includes an API for shimming traits that moved from `NotebookApp` in to `ServerApp` in Jupyter Server. This can be used by applications that subclassed `NotebookApp` to leverage the Python server backend of Jupyter Notebooks. Such extensions should *now* switch to `ExtensionApp` API in Jupyter Server and add `NotebookConfigShimMixin` in their inheritance list to properly handle moved traits.For example, an application class that previously looked like:```pythonfrom notebook.notebookapp import NotebookAppclass MyApplication(NotebookApp):```should switch to look something like:```pythonfrom jupyter_server.extension.application import ExtensionAppfrom notebook_shim.shim import NotebookConfigShimMixinclass MyApplication(NotebookConfigShimMixin, ExtensionApp):```</longdescription>
