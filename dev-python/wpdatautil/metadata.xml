	<longdescription># wpdatautil**wpdatautil** is a Python 3.8 package with specific reusable utility functions for data processing.## Installation`pip install -U wpdatautil` will install the package but intentionally not any third-party requirements.Given that the third-party package requirements can be numerous, and not all of them are relevant to most users, they can be installed as needed by a user.## UsageThe implemented utilities are broadly organized by their primary third-party or builtin package requirement.For example, `.pandas` contains utilities which primarily require the `pandas` package.Similarly, `.boto3.s3path` contains utilities which require both the `boto3` and `s3path` packages.</longdescription>
