This django signal contains event data which can be consumed by thehost application which does the actual event handling.The actual Redis host is configurable.The repository works together with the openedx/openedx-events repository to make the fully functional event bus.Documentation*************To use this implementation of the Event Bus with openedx-events, you'll need to ensure that below the following Django settings are set::    # redis connection url    # https://redis.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/ssl_connection_examples.html#Connecting-to-a-Redis-instance-via-a-URL-string    EVENT_BUS_REDIS_CONNECTION_URL: redis://:password@localhost:6379/    EVENT_BUS_TOPIC_PREFIX: dev    # Required, on the producing side only:    # https://github.com/openedx/openedx-events/blob/06635f3642cee4020d6787df68bba694bd1233fe/openedx_events/event_bus/__init__.py#L105-L112    # This will load a producer class which can send events to redis streams.    EVENT_BUS_PRODUCER: edx_event_bus_redis.create_producer    # Required, on the consumer side only:    # https://github.com/openedx/openedx-events/blob/06635f3642cee4020d6787df68bba694bd1233fe/openedx_events/event_bus/__init__.py#L150-L157    # This will load a consumer class which can consume events from redis streams.    EVENT_BUS_CONSUMER: edx_event_bus_redis.RedisEventConsumerOptional settings that are worth considering::    # If the consumer encounters this many consecutive errors, exit with an error. This is intended to be used in a context where a management system (such as Kubernetes) will relaunch the consumer automatically.    EVENT_BUS_REDIS_CONSUMER_CONSECUTIVE_ERRORS_LIMIT (defaults to None)    # How long the consumer should wait for new entries in a stream.    # As we are running the consumer in a while True loop, changing this setting doesn't make much difference    # expect for changing number of monitoring messages while waiting for new events.    # https://redis.io/commands/xread/#blocking-for-data    EVENT_BUS_REDIS_CONSUMER_POLL_TIMEOUT (defaults to 60 seconds)    # Limits stream size to approximately this number    EVENT_BUS_REDIS_STREAM_MAX_LEN (defaults to 10_000)For manual local testing, see ``Testing locally`` section below.Getting Started***************Developing==========One Time Setup--------------.. code-block::  # Clone the repository  git clone git@github.com:openedx/event-bus-redis.git  cd event-bus-redis  # Set up a virtualenv using virtualenvwrapper with the same name as the repo and activate it  mkvirtualenv -p python3.8 event-bus-redisEvery time you develop something in this repo---------------------------------------------.. code-block::  # Activate the virtualenv  workon event-bus-redis  # Grab the latest code  git checkout main  git pull  # Install/update the dev requirements  make requirements  # Run the tests and quality checks (to verify the status before you make any changes)  make validate  # Make a new branch for your changes  git checkout -b &lt;your_github_username&gt;/&lt;short_description&gt;  # Using your favorite editor, edit the code to make your change.  vim ...  # Run your new tests  pytest ./path/to/new/tests  # Run all the tests and quality checks  make validate  # Commit all your changes  git commit ...  git push  # Open a PR and ask for review.Testing locally---------------* Please execute below commands in virtual environment to avoid messing with  your main python installation.* Install all dependencies using ``make requirements``* Run ``make redis-up`` in current directory.* Run ``make consume_test_event`` to start running a single consumer or ``make multiple_consumer_test_event`` to run two consumers with different consumer names.* Run ``make produce_test_event`` in a separate terminal to produce a fake event, the consumer should log this event.* You can also add a fake handler to test emitted signal via consumer. Add below code snippet to ``edx_event_bus_redis/internal/consumer.py``... code-block:: python  from django.dispatch import receiver  from openedx_events.content_authoring.signals import XBLOCK_DELETED  @receiver(XBLOCK_DELETED)  def deleted_handler(sender, signal, **kwargs):      print(f&quot;&quot;&quot;=======================================  signal: {signal}&quot;&quot;&quot;)      print(f&quot;&quot;&quot;=======================================  kwargs: {kwargs}&quot;&quot;&quot;)Deploying=========After setting up required configuration, events are produced using the``openedx_events.get_producer().send()`` method which needs to be called fromthe producing side.
