	<longdescription>pyllist - linked lists for Python=================================pyllist is a Python module providing basic linked list data structures.Collections implemented in the pyllist module perform well in problemswhich rely on fast insertions and/or deletions of elements inthe middle of a sequence.For this kind of workload, they can be faster than collections.dequeor standard Python lists.This extension requires Python 2.x or 3.x. It should work with anyimplementation (tested with CPython and PyPy).Note however, that for CPython there is a much faster C extensionmodule with the same API at http://github.com/ajakubek/python-llist/Currently pyllist provides the following types of linked lists: - dllist - a doubly linked list - sllist - a singly linked listFull documentation of these classes is available at:http://packages.python.org/pyllist/To install this package, either run &quot;pip install pyllist&quot;,or download it manually from http://pypi.python.org/pypithen unpack the sources and compile them with &quot;python setup.py install&quot;.The most current development version is available at:https://github.com/rgsoda/pypy-llist/Bugs can be reported at:https://github.com/rgsoda/pypy-llist/issuesThis software is distributed under the MIT license.Please see the LICENSE file included in the package for details.</longdescription>
