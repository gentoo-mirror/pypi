It is meant for problems with complicated likelihood topology,including multimodal distributions.  It has support for both parallel temperingand nested transdimensional problems. It was originally developed forgravitational-wave parameter estimation, but can be used for any Bayesianinference problem requring a stochastic sampler.EPSIE is in many ways similar to `emcee&lt;https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&gt;`_ and other bring-your-own-likelihoodPython-based samplers. The primary difference from emcee is EPSIEis not an ensemble sampler; i.e., the Markov chains used by EPSIE do notattempt to share information between each other. Instead, to speed convergence,multiple jump proposal classes are offered that can be customized to theproblem at hand.  These include adaptive proposals that attempt to learn theshape of the distribution during a burn-in period. The user can also easilycreate their own jump proposals... docs-end-marker-do-not-removeFor more information, see the documentation at:https://cdcapano.github.io/epsieAttribution-----------If you use EPSIE in your work, please cite DOI 10.5281/zenodo.5717225 for the latest version, or the DOI specific to the release you used.
