	<longdescription># Redlines`Redlines` produces a Markdown text showing the differences between two strings/text. The changes are represented withstrike-throughs and underlines, which looks similar to Microsoft Word's track changes. This method of showing changes ismore familiar to lawyers and is more compact for long series of characters.Redlines uses [SequenceMatcher](https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html#difflib.SequenceMatcher)to find differences between words used.## ExampleGiven an original string:    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.`And the string to be tested with:    The quick brown fox walks past the lazy dog.The library gives a result of:    The quick brown fox &lt;del&gt;jumps over &lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins&gt;walks past &lt;/ins&gt;the lazy dog.Which is rendered like this:The quick brown fox &lt;del&gt;jumps over &lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins&gt;walks past &lt;/ins&gt;the lazy dog.## Install```shellpip install redlines```## UsageThe library contains one class: `Redlines`, which is used to compare text.```pythonfrom redlines import Redlinestest = Redlines(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&quot;,                &quot;The quick brown fox walks past the lazy dog.&quot;)assert test.output_markdown == &quot;The quick brown fox &lt;del&gt;jumps over &lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins&gt;walks past &lt;/ins&gt;the lazy dog.&quot;```Alternatively, you can create Redline with the text to be tested, and compare several times to see the results.```pythonfrom redlines import Redlinestest = Redlines(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&quot;)assert test.compare(    'The quick brown fox walks past the lazy dog.') == &quot;The quick brown fox &lt;del&gt;jumps over &lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins&gt;walks past &lt;/ins&gt;the lazy dog.&quot;assert test.compare(    'The quick brown fox jumps over the dog.') == 'The quick brown fox jumps over the &lt;del&gt;lazy &lt;/del&gt;dog.'```## Roadmap / ContributingPlease feel free to post issues and comments. I work on this in my free time, so please excuse lack of activity.### Nice things to do* Style the way changes are presented* Other than Markdown, have other output formats (HTML? PDF?)* Associate changes with an author* Show different changes by different authors or times.If this was useful to you, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:houfu@lovelawrobots.com)!## LicenseMIT License</longdescription>
