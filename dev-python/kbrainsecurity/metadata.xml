The python version is specified in the `pyproject.toml` file. A virtual environment can be created by running the command:`poetry shell`From there, dependencies can be installed by typing`poetry install`## pre-commitOnce dependencies have been installed via poetry, use the `pre-commit install` command to configure pre-commit. ## DevelopmentCreate a feature branch and push your changes there. Open a PR on GitHub. This will trigger CICD and publish a prerelease version of the package with appropriate tags and updates to the pyproject.toml file. Merging a PR into main increments the patch version of the release and tags it appropriately. At this time this package can be installed in KBRAIN services with `pipenv` using the `git` protocol.</longdescription>
