	<longdescription>lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  Itprovides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTreeAPI.It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.To contact the project, go to the `project home page&lt;https://lxml.de/&gt;`_ or see our bug tracker athttps://launchpad.net/lxmlIn case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml,you can get it from the github repository athttps://github.com/lxml/lxml .  Note that this requires Cython tobuild the sources, see the build instructions on the project homepage.  To the same end, running ``easy_install lxml==dev`` willinstall lxml fromhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/master#egg=lxml-dev if you havean appropriate version of Cython installed.After an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may becomeavailable athttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tree/lxml-4.9 .Running ``easy_install lxml==4.9bugfix`` will installthe unreleased branch state fromhttps://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/lxml-4.9#egg=lxml-4.9bugfixas soon as a maintenance branch has been established.  Note that thisrequires Cython to be installed at an appropriate version for the build.4.9.2 (2022-12-13)==================Bugs fixed----------* CVE-2022-2309: A Bug in libxml2 2.9.1[0-4] could let namespace declarations  from a failed parser run leak into later parser runs.  This bug was worked around  in lxml and resolved in libxml2 2.10.0.  https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/378Other changes-------------* LP#1981760: ``Element.attrib`` now registers as ``collections.abc.MutableMapping``.* lxml now has a static build setup for macOS on ARM64 machines (not used for building wheels).
