	<longdescription>    SQLAlchemy store formula-aware implementation.    It stores its triples in the following partitions:    * Asserted non rdf:type statements    * Asserted rdf:type statements (in a table which models Class membership).      The motivation for this partition is primarily improved query speed and      scalability as most graphs will always have more rdf:type statements than      others.    * All Quoted statements    In addition it persists namespace mappings in a separate table    </longdescription>
