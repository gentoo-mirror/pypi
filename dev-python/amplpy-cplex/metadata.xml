	<longdescription>AMPLPY-CPLEX------------CPLEX driver for AMPL.  This package uses AMPLS-API, which is an open source set of lightweightinterfaces between AMPL and solvers, which allow:- Read in an AMPL model instance from an `NL` file- Write out the solution as a `sol` file, ready to be imported by AMPL- A choiche between:   - Use of all the solver's capabilities, using its own C API functionalities   - Use of a (provided) generic interface, that encapsulates the most common      functionalities of the solver interfaces, permitting hassle-free solver swap- Usage of existing AMPL licenses, when used together with the AMPL driversThe interfaces are available for multiple languages; the core is written in C++ and it is wrapped using[swig](https://www.swig.org) to other target languages.</longdescription>
