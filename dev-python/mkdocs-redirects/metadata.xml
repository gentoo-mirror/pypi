	<longdescription># mkdocs-redirectsPlugin for [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to create page redirects (e.g. for moved/renamed pages).Initially developed by [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/).## Installing&gt; **Note:** This package requires MkDocs version 1.0.4 or higher.Install with pip:```bashpip install mkdocs-redirects```## UsingTo use this plugin, specify your desired redirects in the plugin's `redirect_maps` setting in your `mkdocs.yml`:```yamlplugins:    - redirects:        redirect_maps:            'old.md': 'new.md'            'old/file.md': 'new/file.md'            'some_file.md': 'http://external.url.com/foobar'```_Note: don't forget that specifying the `plugins` setting will override the defaults if you didn't already have it set! See [this page](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#plugins) for more information._The redirects map should take the form of a key/value pair:- The key of each redirect is the original _markdown doc_ (relative to the `docs_dir` path).  - This plugin will handle the filename resolution during the `mkdocs build` process.    This should be set to what the original markdown doc's filename was (or what it _would be_ if it existed), not the final HTML file rendered by MkDocs- The value is the _redirect target_. This can take the following forms:  - Path of the _markdown doc_ you wish to be redirected to (relative to `docs_dir`)    - This plugin will handle the filename resolution during the `mkdocs build` process.      This should be set to what the markdown doc's filename is, not the final HTML file rendered by MkDocs  - External URL (e.g. `http://example.com`)During the `mkdocs build` process, this plugin will create `.html` files in `site_dir` for each of the &quot;old&quot; file that redirects to the &quot;new&quot; path.It will produce a warning if any problems are encountered or of the redirect target doesn't actually exist (useful if you have `strict: true` set).### `use_directory_urls`If you have `use_directory_urls: true` set (which is the default), this plugin will modify the redirect targets to the _directory_ URL, not the _actual_ `index.html` filename.However, it will create the `index.html` file for each target in the correct place so URL resolution works.For example, a redirect map of `'old/dir/README.md': 'new/dir/README.md'` will result in an HTML file created at `$site_dir/old/dir/index.html` which redirects to `../../new/dir/`.Additionally, a redirect map of `'old/dir/doc_name.md': 'new/dir/doc_name.md'` will result in `$site_dir/old/dir/doc_name/index.html` redirecting to `../../new/dir/doc_name/`.This mimics the behavior of how MkDocs builds the site dir without this plugin.## Developing### Setup a virtualenvCreate a virtualenv using a method of your choice.```bashbrew install pyenv pyenv-virtualenvpyenv install 2.7.18pyenv virtualenv 2.7.18 mkdocs-redirectspyenv activate mkdocs-redirects```### Build```bashmake build```### Test```bashmake test```## Releasing```bashmake release```It will prompt you for your PyPI user and password.See:- &lt;https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/&gt;- &lt;https://packaging.python.org/guides/migrating-to-pypi-org/&gt;</longdescription>
