We worked on his[Codex of the Damned](https://codex-of-the-damned.org/)([repo](https://github.com/lionel-panhaleux/codex-of-the-damned)) to supportinternationalisation. The whole structure of this project is derived from hisCodex, hence the name as a small tribute.## ContributingContributions are welcome.- [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Spigushe/barrins-codex/pulls) will be merged if they respect the general style.- [Issues](https://github.com/Spigushe/barrins-codex/issues) will be dealt with as quickly as possible.This site uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) to generate pagesdynamically .## InstallationTo install a working developpment version of the site, use `pip`:```bashpython3 -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activatepip install -e &quot;.[dev]&quot;```## Run the CodexYou can run the development version of the site using the `codex` entrypoint:```bash$ codex* Serving Flask app &quot;barrins_codex&quot; (lazy loading)* Environment: production  WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.  Use a production WSGI server instead.* Debug mode: off* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)```The Makefile has a command to start codex in debug : `make codex`## VersioningThe version number take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negativeintegers, and do not contain leading zeroes. X is the major version, Y is theminor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increasenumerically. For instance: `1.9.0` -&gt; `1.10.0` -&gt; `1.11.0`.Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, I increment the:1. MAJOR version when I make a backend evolution or a design evolution,1. MINOR version when I add content (most likely a match), and1. PATCH version when I make bug and typo fixes.Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available asextensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.</longdescription>
