Here are some of the features and benefits:* [Proof of space and time](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tmRIb7lgi4QfKkNaxuKOBHRmwbVlGL4f7EsBDr_5xZE/edit) based consensus which allows anyone to farm with commodity hardware* Very easy to use full node and farmer GUI and cli (thousands of nodes active on mainnet)* [Chia seeder](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/Chia-Seeder-User-Guide), which maintains a list of reliable nodes within the Chia network via a built-in DNS server.* Simplified UTXO based transaction model, with small on-chain state* Lisp-style Turing-complete functional [programming language](https://chialisp.com/) for money related use cases* BLS keys and aggregate signatures (only one signature per block)* [Pooling protocol](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/Pooling-User-Guide) that allows farmers to have control of making blocks* Support for light clients with fast, objective syncing* A growing community of farmers and developers around the worldPlease check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki)and [FAQ](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/FAQ) forinformation on this project.Python 3.7+ is required. Make sure your default python version is &gt;=3.7by typing `python3`.If you are behind a NAT, it can be difficult for peers outside your subnet toreach you when they start up. You can enable[UPnP](https://www.homenethowto.com/ports-and-nat/upnp-automatic-port-forward/)on your router or add a NAT (for IPv4 but not IPv6) and firewall rules to allowTCP port 8444 access to your peer.These methods tend to be router make/model specific.Most users should only install harvesters, farmers, plotter, full nodes, and wallets.Setting up a seeder is best left to more advanced users.Building Timelords and VDFs is for sophisticated users, in most environments.Chia Network and additional volunteers are running sufficient Timelordsfor consensus.## InstallingInstall instructions are available in the[INSTALL](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/INSTALL)section of the[chia-blockchain repository wiki](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki).## RunningOnce installed, a[Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide)is available from the repository[wiki](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki).</longdescription>
