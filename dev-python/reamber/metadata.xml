Only update it if you don't plan mind spending time refactoring.## For DevelopersNote that this is still in alpha stage, means a lot of things aren't settled downyet. In other words, many function names and references will change without notice.It is recommended to only build scratch/temp files if you want to utilize this library## MotivationA growing amount of osu!mania players are becoming interested in programming.The best way to learn is to relate it to something that you're familiar with.That's why I'm making a library for most common VSRG (Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game)types.</longdescription>
