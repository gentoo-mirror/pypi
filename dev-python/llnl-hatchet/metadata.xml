It is intended for analyzing performance data that has a hierarchy (for example, serial or parallel profiles that represent calling context trees, call graphs, nested regionsâ€™ timers, etc.). Hatchet implements various operations to analyze a single hierarchical data set or compare multiple data sets, and its API facilitates analyzing such data programmatically.To use hatchet, install it with pip:```$ pip install llnl-hatchet```Or, if you want to develop with this repo directly, run the install script fromthe root directory, which will build the cython modules and add the cloneddirectory to your `PYTHONPATH`:```$ source install.sh```&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llnl/hatchet/develop/screenshot.png&quot; width=800&gt;&lt;/p&gt;### DocumentationSee the [Getting Started](https://llnl-hatchet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) page for basic examples and usage. Full documentation is available in the [User Guide](https://llnl-hatchet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide.html).Examples of performance analysis using hatchet are available [here](https://llnl-hatchet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/analysis_examples.html).The [hatchet tutorial](https://github.com/llnl/hatchet-tutorial) provides a step by step introduction to hatchet features through a live interactive environment in BinderHub.### Interactive VisualizationHatchet now provides an interactive visualization which can be run inside of your Jupyter notebooks. It is dependant on different mechanisms for building which we describe here:The software in the `hatchet/vis` subdirectory requires [Node.js and Node Package Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for the development and building of javascript code.#### Installing node packagesOne you have Node and NPM installed on your system, you can install all necessary node packages by running the following line in your terminal from the `hatchet/vis/` directory:```npm install```#### Building out javascript code with webpackTo build out javascript into the static bundles used by the Jupyter visualizations, run the following line from the `hatchet/vis` directory in your terminal:```npm run build```Alterntinatively if you are developing a visualization, you can run the following line to force bundles to automatically update when you change the javascript source code:```npm run watch```### ContributingHatchet is an open source project.
