This file is included in README.rst from the top-level  so it is limited to pure ReST markup, not Sphinx.gevent is a coroutine_ -based Python_ networking library that uses`greenlet &lt;https://greenlet.readthedocs.io&gt;`_ to provide a high-level synchronous API on top of the `libev`_or `libuv`_ event loop.Features include:* Fast event loop based on `libev`_ or `libuv`_.* Lightweight execution units based on greenlets.* API that re-uses concepts from the Python standard library (for  examples there are `events`_ and  `queues`_).* `Cooperative sockets with SSL support &lt;http://www.gevent.org/api/index.html#networking&gt;`_* `Cooperative DNS queries &lt;http://www.gevent.org/dns.html&gt;`_ performed through a threadpool,  dnspython, or c-ares.* `Monkey patching utility &lt;http://www.gevent.org/intro.html#monkey-patching&gt;`_ to get 3rd party modules to become cooperative* TCP/UDP/HTTP servers* Subprocess support (through `gevent.subprocess`_)* Thread poolsgevent is `inspired by eventlet`_ but features a more consistent API,simpler implementation and better performance.

This file is included in README.rst so it is limited to plain  ReST markup, not Sphinx... note::   If you are reading this document on the `Python Package Index`_   (PyPI, https://pypi.org/), it is specific to the version of gevent that   you are viewing. If you are viewing this document on gevent.org, it   refers to the current state of gevent in source control (git   master).Supported Platforms===================This version of gevent runs on Python 2.7.9 and up, and many versionsof Python 3 (for exact details, see the classifiers on the PyPI pageor in ``setup.py``). gevent requires the `greenlet &lt;https://greenlet.readthedocs.io&gt;`_library and will install the `cffi`_ library by default on Windows.The cffi library will become the default on all platforms in a futurerelease of gevent.This version of gevent also runs on PyPy 7.3.7 (7.3.6 for PyPy2) orabove. On PyPy, there are no external dependencies.gevent is tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and should run on mostother Unix-like operating systems (e.g., FreeBSD, Solaris, etc.).. note::   Windows is supported as a tier 2, &quot;best effort,&quot; platform. It is   suitable for development, but not recommended for production. In   particular, PyPy3 on Windows may have issues, especially with   subprocesses.   On Windows using the deprecated libev backend, gevent is   limited to a maximum of 1024 open sockets due to   `limitations in libev`_. This limitation should not exist   with the default libuv backend.Older Versions of Python------------------------Users of older versions of Python 2 or Python 3 may install an olderversion of gevent. Note that these versions are generally notsupported.+-------+-------+|Python |Gevent ||Version|Version|+=======+=======+|2.5    |1.0.x  ||       |       |+-------+-------+|2.6    |1.1.x  |+-------+-------+|&lt;=     |1.2.x  ||2.7.8  |       |+-------+-------+|3.3    |1.2.x  |+-------+-------+|3.4.0 -| 1.3.x ||3.4.2  |       ||       |       |+-------+-------+|3.4.3  | 1.4.x ||       |       ||       |       |+-------+-------+|3.5.x  | 20.9.0||       |       ||       |       |+-------+-------+Installation============.. note::   This section is about installing released versions of gevent as   distributed on the `Python Package Index`_. For building gevent   from source, including customizing the build and embedded   libraries, see `Installing From Source`_... _Python Package Index: http://pypi.org/project/geventgevent and greenlet can both be installed with `pip`_, e.g., ``pipinstall gevent``. Installation using `buildout&lt;http://docs.buildout.org/en/latest/&gt;`_ is also supported.On Windows, macOS, and Linux, both gevent and greenlet aredistributed as binary `wheels`_... tip::   You need Pip 8.0 or later, or buildout 2.10.0 to install the binary   wheels on Windows or macOS. On Linux, you'll need `pip 19   &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/5008&gt;`_ to install the   manylinux2010 wheels... tip::   Binary wheels cannot be installed on non-manylinux2010 compatible   Linux systems, such as those that use `musl   &lt;https://musl.libc.org&gt;`_, including `Alpine Linux   &lt;https://alpinelinux.org&gt;`_. Those systems must install from source... tip::   Beginning with gevent 20.12.0, 64-bit ARM binaries are distributed   on PyPI for aarch64 manylinux2014 compatible systems. Installing these   needs a very recent version of ``pip``. These wheels *do not*   contain the c-ares resolver, are not tested, and are built with   very low levels of optimizations. Serious production users of   gevent on 64-bit ARM systems are encouraged to build their own   binary wheels.   Beginning with gevent 22.10.0, ppc64le binaries are distributed on   PyPI. The same caveats apply as for 64-bit ARM binaries. Using them   for anything other than local development is discouraged.Installing From Source----------------------If you are unable to use the binary wheels (for platforms where nopre-built wheels are available or if wheel installation is disabled),you can build gevent from source. A normal ``pip install`` willfall back to doing this if no binary wheel is available. See`Installing From Source`_ for more, including common installation issues.Extra Dependencies==================There are a numberof additional libraries that extend gevent's functionality and will beused if they are available. All of these may be installed using`setuptools extras&lt;https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#declaring-extras-optional-features-with-their-own-dependencies&gt;`_,as named below, e.g., ``pip install gevent[events]``.events    In versions of gevent up to and including 20.5.0, this provided configurable    event support using `zope.event    &lt;https://pypi.org/project/zope.event&gt;`_ and was highly    recommended.    In versions after that, this extra is empty and does nothing. It    will be removed in gevent 21.0.dnspython    Enables a pure-Python resolver, backed by `dnspython    &lt;https://pypi.org/project/dnspython&gt;`_. On Python 2, this also    includes `idna &lt;https://pypi.org/project/idna&gt;`_. They can be    installed with the ``dnspython`` extra.    .. note:: This is not compatible with Python 3.10 or dnspython 2.monitor    Enhancements to gevent's self-monitoring capabilities. This    includes the `psutil &lt;https://pypi.org/project/psutil&gt;`_ library    which is needed to monitor memory usage. (Note that this may not    build on all platforms.)recommended    A shortcut for installing suggested extras together. This includes    the non-test extras defined here, plus:    - `backports.socketpair      &lt;https://pypi.org/project/backports.socketpair/&gt;`_ on Python      2/Windows (beginning with release 20.6.0);    - `selectors2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/selectors2/&gt;`_ on Python 2 (beginning with release 20.6.0).test    Everything needed to run the complete gevent test suite... _`pip`: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/.. _`wheels`: http://pythonwheels.com.. _`gevent 1.5`: whatsnew_1_5.html.. _`Installing From Source`: https://www.gevent.org/development/installing_from_source.html.. _`cffi`: https://cffi.readthedocs.io.. _`limitations in libev`: http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.pod#WIN32_PLATFORM_LIMITATIONS_AND_WORKA.. _bug tracker: https://github.com/gevent/gevent/issues.. _mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/gevent.. _blog: https://dev.nextthought.com/blog/categories/gevent.html.. _twitter (@gevent): http://twitter.com/gevent</longdescription>
