	<longdescription># Pylint Print CheckerA Pylint plugin for checking for use of the `print()` function in Python.## InstallationThe best way to install Pylint Print is to use pip as follows:```bashpip install pylint-print```## Example UsageThis simple program is saved as `hello_world.py`:```python&quot;&quot;&quot;a module to demonstrate the pylint-print checker&quot;&quot;&quot;if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)```In order to use pylint-print, this must be included as a plug in there are two main ways to dothis. The first method is to use the command line options:```bashpylint hello_world.py --load-plugins=pylint_print```This will provide a response that should look like this:```************* Module hello_worldhello_world.py:6:4: W8201: Logging should be used instead of the print() function. (print-function)-----------------------------------Your code has been rated at 5.00/10```The other main way to use pylint is with a configuration file. Refer to the [Pylint Documentation](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for more details about the configuration files and how to set one up. The configuration file should have a `load-plugin` key which will need the `pylint_print` addedas follows:```ini# List of plugins (as comma separated values of python module names) to load,# usually to register additional checkers.load-plugins=pylint_print```Once the plugin has been added to the configuration file it is no long necessary to add it to the`pylint` execution, for example:```bashpylint hello_world.py```# Why warn about `print` usage `print` statements  are often the first thing a developer learns, they are useful to add to your code when developing to understand how it works and debug problems. However, as a project grows they can become problematic, it is much better to use a logger thatallows:* Log messages to be filtered by type or module* Log messages can be redirected to other places rather than the console e.g. a fileFor these reasons some projects may want to restrict the usage of `print` in their coding rules and make a check as part of the linting checks to avoid needing manual reviews# Further InformationView on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pylint-print/)</longdescription>
