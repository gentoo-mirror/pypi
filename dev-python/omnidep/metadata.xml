This would be a good idea ifyou're using a new (or pre-release) version of Python not included in thisrepo's CI testing... code-block:: bash    pip install pyOpenSSL opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk pytest    pytest --pyargs omnidep.tstUsage-----.. code-block:: bash    omnidep pyproject.tomlConfiguration-------------omnidep uses your project's poetry configuration to work out:* What source files to search for imports, from ``tool.poetry.packages``.* What dependencies your project declares, from ``tool.poetry.dependencies``.* What dev-dependencies your project declares, from  ``tool.poetry.dev-dependencies`` and ``tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies``.If you have test code that you want omnidep to search for imports, then:* If you keep your test code &quot;inside&quot; your project, then list it in  ``local-test-paths`` in the ``[tool.omnidep]`` section described below,  otherwise omnidep treats it as regular code.* If you keep your test code &quot;outside&quot; your project, then either use the  ``--tests`` command-line option to locate it, or list it in  ``local-test-paths`` in ``[tool.omnidep]``, otherwise omnidep ignores it. You  also need to configure ``local-test-packages`` if some of your test files  import other test files, for example if you have shared helper functions.omnidep is configured using the ``pyproject.toml`` file, and specifically the``[tool.omnidep]`` section. Unrecognised keys are rejected and omnidep will notrun (so, if you want to use a particular key then you should require at leastthe minimum version of omnidep that recognises it). The following config keysare recognised:ignore-imports^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Example: ``ignore-imports = [&quot;X&quot;]``Since: 0.2.0Causes omnidep to ignore all import statements from X, for example``import X``, ``from X.Y import Z``. omnidep will behave as if your code doesnot use package X, even if it does. X must be a top-level package. It is notcurrently possible to selectively ignore a sub-package (like X.Y), nor is itcurrently possible to ignore imports from some files but not others.child-packages^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Example: ``child-packages = {boto3 = [&quot;botocore&quot;]}``Since: 0.2.0Causes omnidep to consider a dependency on boto3 to also supply botocore. Thissaves you having to explictly list the child as a dependency of your project.You chould only do this when the child is inherant to the parent, not justbecause by chance you pull in a package you need via an indirect dependency.The reason is that indirect dependencies can change, and the project that youdo depend on might not require the same version of the child that your usagerequires. Only if the projects are closely related can you assume that theversion you require of one will provide the features you need from the other.ignore-dependencies^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Example: ``ignore-dependencies = [&quot;X&quot;]``Since: 0.2.0Causes omnidep to ignore the project X listed in your project's dependencies.omnidep will behave as if your project does not depend on X, even if it does.ignore-dependencies-order^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Example: ``ignore-dependencies-order = true``Since: 0.2.0Causes omnidep to skip the check that your dependencies are alphabeticallyordered.ignore-dev-dependencies-order^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Example: ``ignore-dev-dependencies-order = true``Since: 0.2.0Causes omnidep to skip the check that your dev-dependencies are alphabeticallyordered.local-test-paths^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Example: ``local-test-paths = [&quot;myproject/tests/&quot;]``Since: 0.2.0Causes omnidep to treat all code in ``myproject.tests`` as test code, meaningthat anything it imports can be provided either by your projects dependenciesor by its dev-dependencies. Imports from code that is not test code must beprovided by non-dev dependencies.local-test-packages^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Example: ``local-test-packages = [&quot;tests&quot;]``Since: 0.2.0Causes omnidep to treat ``tests`` as part of the current project, but only whenconsidering imports that appear in test code. Use this when your test code isnot shipped as part of your project.Error codes explained---------------------X, Y, P, Q, R, represent the names of imports or dependencies, depending on themessage.ODEP001^^^^^^^| ``package 'X' is imported but not listed in dependencies``| ``package 'X' is imported but not listed in dev-dependencies``|X is the name you imported, which is not necessarily the same as the name ofthe project you have to install (for example the project ``beautifulsoup4``installs the package ``bs4``). omnidep does its best to find what project yourdesired package comes from, but if it fails, or if you don't have a suitabledependency, then this is the result.To fix, choose one of the following:* List the project name in your dependencies. If the package is used from test  code, then the dependency can be either dev or non-dev. If the package is  used from non-test code, then the dependency needs to be non-dev.* To ignore the import, add it to the list of ignored imports in your  ``[tool.omnidep]`` config, like ``ignore-imports = [&quot;X&quot;]``.* The package might come from a dependency of a dependency, and you might  prefer not to explicitly list it as a direct dependency too, so you can list  X as a child of some other dependency that you do list. You should only do  this when the indirect dependency is inherent to the direct dependency, for  example ``boto3`` provides ``botocore``. Add  ``child-packages = {something = [&quot;X&quot;]}`` to your ``[tool.omnidep]`` config,  meaning that the project named &quot;something&quot; provides &quot;X&quot;, and so a dependency  on &quot;something&quot; is acceptable in place of a dependency on &quot;X&quot;.ODEP002^^^^^^^``module 'X' is imported but not installed``Not only is there no dependency found that provides X, but X isn't evencurrently installed. omnidep relies on locally installed metadata to help itfind what dependencies correspond to what imports.To fix, choose one of the following:* If your project has X as a dependency, but you haven't installed your  project then install your project, bringing in its dependencies.* Add a dependency that provides X.* Ignore the import by listing it in your in your ``[tool.omnidep]`` config,  like ``ignore-imports = [&quot;X&quot;]``.ODEP003^^^^^^^``Namespace package found: any of ['P', 'Q', 'R'] might provide 'X'``If projects P, Q, and R all provide code in the Python package X, then omnidepdoesn't know which one you need in order to satisfy a given import. If youdeclare dependencies on all of them (that is, all the ones you currently haveinstalled), then omnidep is satisfied. If you depend on some but not others,then you get this message.To fix, choose one of the following:* If you don't need the ones you don't declare dependencies on, and they are  installed accidentally, then uninstall them.* If appropriate, declare dependencies on all of P, Q, and R. However, this  might not be appropriate because P and Q might be genuine direct dependencies  of your code, whereas R was pulled in indirectly via something else. You  don't want to have to list indirect dependencies as direct dependencies.* Otherwise you have to resolve for yourself whether your dependencies are  adequate, then ignore the import with ``ignore-imports = [&quot;X&quot;]`` in your  ``[tool.omnidep]`` config.ODEP004^^^^^^^``Namespace package found: any of ['P', 'Q', 'R'] might provide 'X', and there are no dependencies on any of them``If projects P, Q, and R all provide code in the Python package X, then omnidepdoesn't know which one you need in order to satisfy a given import. If youdeclare dependencies on all of them (that is, all the ones you currently haveinstalled), then omnidep is satisfied. If you depend on none of them,then you get this message.To fix, choose one of the following:* If appropriate, declare dependencies on all of P, Q, and R. However, this  might not be appropriate because P and Q might be genuine direct dependencies  of your code, whereas R was pulled in indirectly via something else. You  don't want to have to list indirect dependencies as direct dependencies.* Otherwise you have to resolve for yourself whether your dependencies are  adequate, then ignore the import with ``ignore-imports = [&quot;X&quot;]`` in your  ``[tool.omnidep]`` config.ODEP005^^^^^^^``unused dependencies in project file: {'X', 'Y'}``omnidep expects you not to list any dependencies that you don't import. Thismight be completely legitimate, for example:* the dependency is a plugin to some framework and will be used via some means  other than an explicit ``import`` in your code;* you are controlling the version of an indirect dependency, to deal with  some problem caused by unexpected breaking changes.Unused dev-dependencies are always ignored, since they tend to include lintersand suchlike.To fix, choose one of the following:* Remove the dependency.* List the dependency in your ``[tool.omnidep]`` config like  ``ignore-dependencies = [&quot;X&quot;]``.ODEP006^^^^^^^| ``dependencies are not sorted: 'Y' before 'X'``| ``dev-dependencies are not sorted: 'Y' before 'X'``|Ignoring ``python``, which is allowed to come first, omnidep expects you tolist dependencies in case-insensitive alphabetical order within each section(dev and non-dev).To fix, choose one of the following:* List your dependencies alphabetically.* Set ``ignore-dependencies-order = true`` or  ``ignore-dev-dependencies-order = true`` in your ``[tool.omnidep]`` config.ODEP007^^^^^^^``dependency 'X' is not the preferred name: consider 'Y'``omnidep expects you to use either of two formats to name dependencies in yourproject file: the &quot;Normalized Name&quot; as defined in`PEP 503 &lt;https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/&gt;`_ or the name the dependency usesfor itself in its metadata. Any name that normalizes to the same value willwork, but inconsistent naming tends to lead to confusion, or to failing to findmentions when you search for them.To fix:* Use the name omnidep suggests, or the normalized name.ODEP008^^^^^^^``Module 'X' not under package management but found on python path``omnidep cannot find any project that provides X, but it is available to import.This can happen for example if you have set up the ``PYTHONPATH`` to find thecode, instead of installing it as a dependency.To fix, choose one of the following:* If this is an error, list a suitable dependency.* If this occurs when your test code is importing other modules also within  your test code (for example helper utilities) then you can configure  ``local-test-packages = [&quot;X&quot;]`` in your ``[tool.omnidep]`` config, and/or  ``local-test-paths`` with the location of the test source.* If you know what you're doing, and users of your project will know how to  supply the code that you're importing, then ignore the import with  ``ignore-imports = [&quot;X&quot;]`` in your ``[tool.omnidep]`` config.Changelog=========0.3.5-----* No longer depends on importlib-metadata or tomli in Python versions that  have equivalent built-in libraries.0.3.4-----* Report unused dependencies as a sorted list* Allow `python -m omnidep` (https://github.com/sjjessop/omnidep/issues/2)0.3.3-----* Treat local-test-paths config more like --tests option.* Non-zero exit code if there are any errors reported.* Documentation improvements.0.3.2-----* Read dev dependencies from the new location used by Poetry 1.2.0+* Add Python 3.11 to PyPI classifiers.0.3.1-----* Add Python 3.11 to the test matrix, and use separate badges in the README  for what is tagged on PyPI vs. what is tested.* Documentation improvements.* Uncap Python dependency. If Python ever reaches version 4, you are free to  install omnidep on it and see what happens!0.3.0-----* Breaking: When testing that dependencies are sorted, do it case-insensitive.* Deal with some build issues.0.2.1-----* Refer to online docs insted of long message in terminal.* Publish to PyPI.0.2.0-----* Minor documentation improvements.* Lower bounds for dependencies importlib-metadata, isort, and tomli.* CI test of the lower-bound versions.</longdescription>
