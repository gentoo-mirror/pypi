	<longdescription>*********pyspotify*********WARNING: This library no longer works=====================================pyspotify is a Python wrapper around the libspotify C library, and thus dependson libspotify for everything it does.In May 2015, libspotify was deprecated by Spotify and active maintenancestopped. At this point, libspotify had been the main way to integrate withSpotify for six years, and was part of numerous open source projects andcommercial applications, including many receivers and even cars.  It remainedthe only API for playback outside Android and iOS.In February 2016, server side changes to the Spotify API caused the searchfunctionality to stop working, without Spotify ever acknowledging it. Users ofpyspotify could work around this by using the Spotify web API for searches andpyspotify for playback.In April 2022, `Spotify announced&lt;https://developer.spotify.com/community/news/2022/04/12/libspotify-sunset/&gt;`_that they would sunset the libspotify API one month later.In May 2022, new libspotify connections to Spotify started failing. Withlibspotify dead, pyspotify was dead too.After two years in development from May 2013 to May 2015, and seven years ofloyal service this project has reached its end.**There will be no further updates to pyspotify.**Hopefully, the pyspotify source code can still serve as a complete example ofhow to successfully wrap a large C library in Python using CFFI.Introduction============pyspotify provides a Python interface to`Spotify's &lt;https://www.spotify.com/&gt;`__ online music streaming service.With pyspotify you can access music metadata, search in Spotify's library of20+ million tracks, manage your Spotify playlists, and play music fromSpotify. All from your own Python applications.pyspotify uses `CFFI &lt;https://cffi.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_ to make a pure Pythonwrapper around the official libspotify library. It works on CPython 2.7 and3.5+, as well as PyPy 2.7 and 3.5+. It is known to work on Linux andmacOS. Windows support should be possible, but is awaiting a contributor withthe interest and knowledge to maintain it.Project resources=================- `Documentation &lt;https://pyspotify.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_- `Source code &lt;https://github.com/jodal/pyspotify&gt;`_- `Issue tracker &lt;https://github.com/jodal/pyspotify/issues&gt;`_.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyspotify    :target: https://pypi.org/project/pyspotify/    :alt: Latest PyPI version.. image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/jodal/pyspotify/CI    :target: https://github.com/jodal/pyspotify/actions?workflow=CI    :alt: CI build status.. image:: https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/pyspotify.svg    :target: https://pyspotify.readthedocs.io/    :alt: Read the Docs build status.. image:: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/gh/jodal/pyspotify   :target: https://codecov.io/gh/jodal/pyspotify   :alt: Test coverage</longdescription>
