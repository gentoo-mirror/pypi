	<longdescription># HEflow: A Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning Lifecycle PlatformHEflow is a platform to streamline privacy-preserving machine learningdevelopment, including tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducibleruns, and sharing and deploying encrypted models. Built on top of[MLflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow),[Seldon MLServer](https://github.com/SeldonIO/MLServer) and[OpenMined TenSEAL](https://github.com/OpenMined/TenSEAL), HEflow offers a setof lightweight homomorphic encryption APIs that can be used with any existingmachine learning application or library (scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow,PyTorch, etc), wherever you currently run ML code (e.g. in notebooks, standaloneapplications, or the cloud).[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://gesis.mybinder.org/v2/gh/inaccel/heflow/master)[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/heflow.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/heflow)## Homomorphic Encryption (HE)Homomorphic encryption differs from typical encryption methods in that it allowscomputation to be performed directly on encrypted data without requiring accessto a secret key. The result of such a computation remains in encrypted form, andcan at a later point be revealed by the owner of the secret key. Thisground-breaking technology has enabled industry and government to providenever-before enabled capabilities for outsourced computation securely.Homomorphic encryption workflows, for privacy-preserving machine learning,involve three entities:1. an ML model owner,2. a cloud server that performs model inference on HE encrypted data using thepre-computed ML model, and3. a user who sends confidential data to the cloud for model inference.In all cases, the cloud should learn nothing about the underlying encrypteddata.## Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning Operations (PPMLOps)PPMLOps is a set of processes and automated steps to manage code, data, andencrypted models. This section describes a typical PPMLOps workflow.![HEflow PPMLOps](assets/heflow-ppmlops.svg)*PPMLOps using HEflow*1. **Experiments**Data scientists develop, train and tune the model on the production data,then they encrypt &amp;#9312; and register it with the Encrypted Model Registry.Model quality is evaluated by testing on held-out production data. Thispipeline can be triggered by code changes or by automated retraining jobs.2. **Encrypted Model Registry**Autologging saves a record of the training and evaluation process, whichincludes model metrics, parameters, tags, and the encrypted model itself.When training and hyperparameter tuning are complete, the data scientistregisters the final encrypted model artifact in the Encrypted Model Registryfor the production environment. This records a link between the encryptedmodel and the code used to generate it.2. **Encrypted Model Serving**A continuous deployment (CD) process takes new encrypted models and deploys&amp;#9313; them for low-latency online serving (APIs). Options include cloudprovider serving endpoints, or custom serving applications.2. **Invocations**The serving system loads the Production encrypted model version from theEncrypted Model Registry. For each request, it scores the encrypted data&amp;#9314;, and returns encrypted predictions &amp;#9315;.## What is HEflow?HEflow is an open source platform developed by InAccel to help manage thecomplete privacy-preserving machine learning lifecycle with enterprisereliability, security and scale. It tackles four primary functions:### :hammer_and_wrench: Encrypted Model developmentAccelerate and simplify privacy-preserving machine learning lifecycle managementwith a standardized framework for developing production-ready PPML models. WithHEflow, you can bootstrap PPML projects, perform rapid iteration with ease andship high-quality encrypted models to production at scale.### :clipboard: Experiment trackingRun experiments with any ML library, framework or language, and automaticallykeep track of parameters, metrics, code and encrypted models from eachexperiment. By using HEflow, you can securely share, manage and compareexperiment results along with corresponding artifacts and code versions.### :jigsaw: Encrypted Model managementUse one central place to discover and share PPML models, collaborate on movingthem from experimentation to online testing and production, integrate withapproval and governance workflows and CI/CD pipelines, and monitor PPMLdeployments and their performance. HEflow facilitates sharing of expertise andknowledge, and helps you stay in control.### :package: Encrypted Model deploymentQuickly deploy production encrypted models for batch inference or as[gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc) homomorphic encryption APIs using built-inintegration with Docker containers or[KServe](https://github.com/kserve/kserve). With HEflow, you can operationalizeand monitor production encrypted models to scale based on the business needs.## InstallingInstall HEflow from PyPI via `pip install heflow`## Official HEflow Docker ImageThe official HEflow Docker image is available on Docker Hub athttps://hub.docker.com/r/inaccel/heflow.```sh# Pull the latest versiondocker pull inaccel/heflow```</longdescription>
