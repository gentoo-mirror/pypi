	<longdescription>Simple check list for release from AllenNLP repo: https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/setup.pyTo create the package for pypi.1. Change the version in __init__.py, setup.py as well as docs/source/conf.py.2. Commit these changes with the message: &quot;Release: VERSION&quot;3. Add a tag in git to mark the release: &quot;git tag VERSION -m'Adds tag VERSION for pypi' &quot;   Push the tag to git: git push --tags origin master4. Build both the sources and the wheel. Do not change anything in setup.py between   creating the wheel and the source distribution (obviously).   For the wheel, run: &quot;python setup.py bdist_wheel&quot; in the top level directory.   (this will build a wheel for the python version you use to build it).   For the sources, run: &quot;python setup.py sdist&quot;   You should now have a /dist directory with both .whl and .tar.gz source versions.5. Check that everything looks correct by uploading the package to the pypi test server:   twine upload dist/* -r pypitest   (pypi suggest using twine as other methods upload files via plaintext.)   You may have to specify the repository url, use the following command then:   twine upload dist/* -r pypitest --repository-url=https://test.pypi.org/legacy/   Check that you can install it in a virtualenv by running:   pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi nlp6. Upload the final version to actual pypi:   twine upload dist/* -r pypi7. Copy the release notes from RELEASE.md to the tag in github once everything is looking hunky-dory.8. Update the documentation commit in .circleci/deploy.sh for the accurate documentation to be displayed9. Update README.md to redirect to correct documentation.</longdescription>
