	<longdescription>THE VIRTUAL BRAIN SCIENTIFIC LIBRARY====================================The Virtual Brain Project (TVB Project) has the purpose of offering somemodern tools to the Neurosciences community, for computing, simulatingand analyzing functional and structural data of human brains.&quot;TVB Scientific Library&quot; is the most important scientific contributionof TVB Project, but only a part of our code. In order to use this TVBPython Library (modify/run/test), you are advised to follow the stepsdescribed here:http://docs.thevirtualbrain.com/manuals/ContributorsManual/ContributorsManual.html#contributors-manualThe interaction with TVB source code is recommended for advanced usersonly, for which the concepts proposed by TVB are known and understood,and which also have some programming knowledge.&quot;TVB Scientific Library&quot; comes in two major forms for code-contributors:as a light-weight Python library, or plugged into TVB framework(including Web interface and Persistence of data layers). Depending onyour needs and resources, you could use any of the two available optionsfor contributing and testing new code.&quot;TVB Scientific Library&quot; is a light-weight, stand-alone Python librarythat contains all the needed packages in order to run simulations andanalysis on data without the need for the entire TVB Framework. Thisimplies that no storage will be provided so data from each session willbe lost on close. You need to either persist it yourself in some manneror use the full TVBFramework where HDF5 / database storage is providedas default.For more details, check: http://www.thevirtualbrain.org/&quot;TVB Scientific Library&quot; contains the following packages: basic,datatypes, simulator and analyzers. The dependencies between thesepackages can be seen in tvb-package-diagram.jpg . Following is a shortdescription of each of these packages:-  tvb.basicThis package is the base of TVB and holds sub-packages that are used bymost of the other packages like logging, global settings and the TVBtraits package. You should rarely (if at all) need to change code inthis package, and should know exactly what you are doing beforeattempting to change anything from here.-  tvb.datatypesThe simulator and analyzers packages (as well as uploaders andvisualizers in TVB Framework) will need to have a common &quot;language&quot; inorder to work with the same data. In TVB architecture, that &quot;commonlanguage&quot; is represented by Data Types. TVB Data Types declarations arelocated in this package.-  tvb.simulatorThe Simulation Component is the most important component in The VirtualBrain solution, as it is the component responsible for all thescientific computation related to brain models and data.You can find various demos of using the simulator here:http://docs.thevirtualbrain.org/demos/Demos.html .-  tvb.analyzersHolds modules that can run various analysis of data resulted from thesimulator. TVB is not strong indoing data analysis, we barely have a minimum set of analyzers forimmediate needs.NOTE:To contribute to this repo, you are advised to first fork it underGitHub (through the web ui), and next clone that fork on your machine,and use it as you use any other git repository.Testing=======For testing the package, the `Pytest  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/&gt;`_framework is used. Pytest can be installed using pip.Pytest will run all files in the current directory and its subdirectoriesof the form test_*.py or \*_test.py.More generally, it follows `standard test discovery rules&lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html&gt;`_The command for running our tests has two forms.Recommendation when working with a git clone of tvb-library::    cd [folder_where_tvb_library_is]    pytest tvb/test [--junitxml=path]The second alternative form of running TVB tests, when installing TVB from Pypi, is::    pip install -U tvb-library    pytest --pyargs tvb.tests.libraryCoverage--------A coverage report can be generated with::    pip install pytest-cov    cd [folder_where_tvb_library_is]    py.test --cov-config .coveragerc --cov=tvb tvb/tests/ --cov-branch --cov-report xml:[file_where_xml_will_be_generated]Further Resources=================-  For issue tracking we are using Jira: http://req.thevirtualbrain.org-  For API documentation and live demos, have a look here:   http://docs.thevirtualbrain.org-  A public mailing list for users of The Virtual Brain can be joined   and followed using: tvb-users@googlegroups.com-  Raw demo IPython Notebooks can be found under:   https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-root/tree/master/tvb_documentation/demosAcknowledgments===============This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research andInnovation under the Specific Grant Agreement Nos. 785907 (Human Brain Project SGA2), 945539 (Human Brain Project SGA3)and VirtualBrainCloud 826421.</longdescription>
