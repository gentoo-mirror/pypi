	<longdescription># rnpfindCommand line tool for collecting and generating RNA-RBP interaction data invarious formats.## Installation```pip install rnpfind```*Requirements*: - Python &gt;=3.8## Usage`rnpfind` can be used as a command line tool as follows:```rnpfind &lt;transcript&gt;```where `transcript` is a gene name such as &quot;PTEN&quot;, or an hg38 coordinate range(such as 11:65497688-65506516)*Note*: If a transcript is specified through genomic coordinates, thetranscript is assumed to be on the forward strand (the &quot;+&quot; strand). On theother hand, a transcript specified by name will have its strand positioningcorrectly identified.The tool takes a transcript as input, and computes the binding sites of variousRBPs on the transcript. The information is collected from data sourcesincluding RBPDB, ATTRACT, and POSTAR.The tool produces as output the binding data in a folder (use `--out-dir` tospecify). A few output formats are supported (use `--out-format` to specify): - `bed` format: a widely used   [format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BED_(file_format))   for displaying intervals. A bed file created in this way could be visualized   on a genome browser, for example. Note the `--trackhub` option avaiable to   generate a trackhub structure (useful for hosting a large number of indexed   bed files (bigBed files) and allowing users to view on genome browsers like   the UCSC Genome Browser. - `csv` format: an `N`x`N` table (where `N`=number of RBPs) showing binding   correlations of RBPs on the particular transcript analyzed. This could be   useful for inferring molecular mechanisms on certain regions of the   transcriptome.For more options, run `rnpfind --help`### Within PythonYou can import `rnpfind` to your Python code as follows:```from rnpfind import rnpfind# Collect data on Malat1rnpfind(&quot;malat1&quot;)```The data is written to disk like in the command line call.Check `help(rnpfind)` for keyword arg options.Perhaps not so usefully, you can find the genome version `rnpfind` is workingwith programatically:```from rnpfind import GENOME_VERSIONprint(GENOME_VERSION)```## How does it work?In principle, RNA-RBP interactions can be backed by two forms of evidence:experimental and computational.The experimental binding sites are collected on large databases such as POSTAR.The computational binding sites are generated by scanning RNA-binding-motifs ofvarious RBPs (collected from RBPDB and ATTRACT) across a transcript to look forhits.*As a result, the tool requires around 6.4GB to function.* The data isdownloaded automatically on the first run of the tool, or can be downloadedmanually using `rnpfind-download`.If the above memory footprint is too much for you to handle, consider using theweb tool avaiable at https://rnpfind.com## ContributingAny suggestions / PR requests are welcome!</longdescription>
