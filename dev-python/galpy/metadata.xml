	<longdescription>&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;    &lt;b&gt;Galactic Dynamics in python&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;[galpy](http://www.galpy.org) is a Python package for galactic dynamics. It supports orbit integration in a variety of potentials, evaluating and sampling various distribution functions, and the calculation of action-angle coordinates for all static potentials. `galpy` is an [astropy](http://www.astropy.org/) [affiliated package](http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/) and provides full support for astropyâ€™s [Quantity](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.units.Quantity.html) framework for variables with units.AUTHOR======Jo Bovy - bovy at astro dot utoronto dot caSee[AUTHORS.txt](https://github.com/jobovy/galpy/blob/main/AUTHORS.txt)for a full list of contributors.If you find this code useful in your research, please let me know. **Ifyou use galpy in a publication, please cite** [Bovy(2015)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJS..216...29B) **and link tohttp://github.com/jobovy/galpy**. See [the acknowledgement documentationsection](http://docs.galpy.org/en/latest/index.html#acknowledging-galpy)for a more detailed guide to citing parts of the code. Thanks!LOOKING FOR HELP?=================The latest documentation can be found[here](http://docs.galpy.org/en/latest/). You can also join the[galpy slack community](https://galpy.slack.com/) for any questionsrelated to `galpy`; join[here](https://join.slack.com/t/galpy/shared_invite/zt-p6upr4si-mX7u8MRdtm~3bW7o8NA_Ww).If you find *any* bug in the code, please report these using the [IssueTracker](http://github.com/jobovy/galpy/issues) or by joining the [galpyslack community](https://galpy.slack.com/).If you are having issues with the installation of `galpy`, please firstconsult the [InstallationFAQ](http://docs.galpy.org/en/latest/installation.html#installation-faq).PYTHON VERSIONS AND DEPENDENCIES================================`galpy` supports Python 3. Specifically, galpy supports Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10,and 3.11. GitHub Actions CI builds regularly check support forPython 3.11 (and of 3.8, 3.9, and 3.11 using a more limited, core set of tests)on Linux and Windows (and 3.11 on Mac OS). Python 2.7 is no longer supported.This package requires [Numpy](https://numpy.org/),[Scipy](http://www.scipy.org/), and[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/). Certain advancedfeatures require the GNU Scientific Library([GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)), with action calculationsrequiring version 1.14 or higher. Other optional dependencies include:* Support for providing inputs and getting outputs as Quantities with units is provided through[`astropy`](http://www.astropy.org/).* Querying SIMBAD for the coordinates of an object in the `Orbit.from_name` initialization method requires [`astroquery`](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).* Displaying a progress bar for certain operations (e.g., orbit integration of multiple objects at once) requires [`tqdm`](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm).* Plotting arbitrary functions of Orbit attributes requires [`numexpr`](https://github.com/pydata/numexpr).* Speeding up the evaluation of certain functions in the C code requires [`numba`](https://numba.pydata.org/).* Constant-anisotropy DFs in `galpy.df.constantbetadf` require [`JAX`](https://github.com/google/jax).* Use of `SnapshotRZPotential` and `InterpSnapshotRZPotential` requires [`pynbody`](https://github.com/pynbody/pynbody).Other parts of the code may require additional packages and you will be alerted by the code if they arenot installed.CONTRIBUTING TO GALPY=====================If you are interested in contributing to galpy\'s development, take alook at [this briefguide](https://github.com/jobovy/galpy/wiki/Guide-for-new-contributors)on the wiki. This will hopefully help you get started!Some further development notes can be found on the[wiki](http://github.com/jobovy/galpy/wiki/). This includes a list ofsmall and larger extensions of galpy that would be useful[here](http://github.com/jobovy/galpy/wiki/Possible-galpy-extensions) aswell as a longer-term roadmap[here](http://github.com/jobovy/galpy/wiki/Roadmap). Please let the maindeveloper know if you need any help contributing!</longdescription>
