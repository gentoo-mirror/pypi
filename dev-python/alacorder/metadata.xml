If your device can run Python 3.9 or later, it can run Alacorder.*** To skip installation, download the prebuilt executable for your operating system (MacOS or Windows) from GitHub. Open the executable file and wait for Alacorder to launch.* If you already have Python installed, open Command Prompt or Terminal and enter `pip install alacorder` or `pip3 install alacorder`. * Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) before using `pip` if the above methods do not work. Once your Python environment is configured, repeat these installation instructions in a terminal.```Usage: python -m alacorder [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...  ALACORDER 79Options:  --version   Show the version and exit.  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.Commands:  append   Append one case text archive to another  archive  Create full text archive from case PDFs  fetch    Fetch cases from Alacourt.com with input query...  start    Launch graphical user interface  table    Export data tables from archive or directory```## **Alacorder includes a desktop application, command line interface, and a python module for parsing case PDFs.**#### **Once you have a Python environment up and running, you can launch the guided interface in two ways:**1. *Utilize the graphical interface:* Use the command line tool `python -m alacorder start`, or `python3 -m alacorder start`. 2. *Use the command line interface:* Replace the `start` command with `--help` or `-h` to view list of commands.#### **Alacorder can be used without writing any code, and exports to common formats like Excel (`.xls`, `.xlsx`), Apache Parquet (`.parquet`), CSV (`.csv`), and JSON (`.json`).*** Alacorder compresses case text into case archives (`.parquet`) to save storage and processing time. # **Special Queries**```pythonfrom alacorder import alac```### **For more advanced queries, Alacorder can extract fields and tables from case records with just a few lines of code.*** Call `alac.set(input_conf, output_conf, **kwargs)` to configure your input and output paths. Feed the output to any of the table parsing functions to begin.* Call `alac.archive()` to export a full text archive. It's recommended that you create a full text archive (`.parquet`) file before making tables from your data. Full text archives can be scanned faster than PDF directories and require less storage.* Call `alac.tables()` to export detailed case information tables. If export type is `.xls` or `.xlsx`, the `cases`, `fees`, and `charges` tables can be exported simultaneously.* Call `alac.charges()` to export `charges` table only.* Call `alac.fees()` to export `fees` table only.* Call `alac.cases()` to export `cases` table only.```pythonimport warningswarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')from alacorder import alacpdf_directory = &quot;/Users/crimson/Desktop/Tutwiler/&quot;archive = &quot;/Users/crimson/Desktop/Tutwiler.parquet&quot;tables = &quot;/Users/crimson/Desktop/Tutwiler.xlsx&quot;# write archive to Tutwiler.parquetc = alac.set(pdf_directory, archive)alac.archive(c) print(&quot;Full text archive complete. Now processing case information into tables at &quot; + tables)# write fees table to Tutwiler.parquetd = alac.set(archive, tables, table=&quot;fees&quot;)alac.tables(d)```# **Working with case data in Python**### Out of the box, Alacorder exports to `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv`, `.json`, and `.parquet`. But you can use `pandas`, `polars` and other python libraries to create your own data collection workflows and customize Alacorder exports. ***The snippet below prints the fee sheets from a directory of case PDFs as it reads them.***```pythonfrom alacorder import alacimport polars as plqueue = alac.get_paths(&quot;/Users/crimson/Desktop/Tutwiler/&quot;) # -&gt; [str]rows = []for i, path in enumerate(queue):    text = alac.getPDFText(path)    cnum = alac.getCaseNumber(text)    cty = alac.getCounty(text)    tbal = alac.getTotalBalance(text)    ptr = alac.getPaymentToRestore(text) # i.e. voting rights    rows += [[cnum, cty, tbal, ptr]]cases = pl.DataFrame(rows)cases.write_excel(&quot;/Users/crimson/Desktop/Tutwiler/summary.xlsx&quot;)```## Extending Alacorder with `polars` and other toolsAlacorder runs on [`polars`](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars), a python library you can use to work with and analyze tabular data. `polars` can read from and write to all major data storage formats. It can connect to a wide variety of services to provide for easy import and export.```pythonimport polars as plcontents = pl.read_json(&quot;/path/to/archive.json&quot;)```If you would like to visualize data without exporting to Excel or another format, create a `jupyter notebook` and install tools like `matplotlib`, `tabulate`, and `itables` to get started. [Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html) is a Python project you can use to create interactive notebooks for data analysis and other purposes. It can be installed using `pip install jupyter` or `pip3 install jupyter` and launched using `jupyter notebook`. Your device may already be equipped to view `.ipynb` notebooks. ## **Resources*** [`polars` user guide](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/user-guide/index.html)* [regex cheat sheet](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html)* [Anaconda (tutorials on python data analysis)](https://www.anaconda.com/open-source)* [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)* [Jupyter Notebook introduction](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/)**“Ethan Sneckenberger”**```oh quash this beef dear family of mineive sat here for weeks, in python, i pineits truly been a shitful yearand even still i'm not in the clearso free me from my prison of shamethough surely i deserve the blameive sat in penitent filth for theeive published not one draft but 783(to prove i will fight for my place in heaven,i just published 787)ive pepped and ive pooped and ive smoked so much tree(like a lot a lot)ive fixed all the indents and parsed all the feestallying charges all night and all dayhere on this dumb east edge couch here i'll stayso plunge into me as i plunge into youoh alacorder you make me so bluebut one thing i know 'fore my heart can amendi must tend to you 'fore my dick i will tendmy dick cries its hunger, i weep for its thirstbut do let me take care of tutwiler firstthe snake in my pants puts my head in a trancei give not a look, not a stare, not a glancebut still in my heart i know one thing is truethere's truly no end to how much i'll do for the one that i love, i'll forego the dovelayer by layer i'll unpeel the onioni'll fight through the rumorsthe gossip the hatersill fight through my doubt andill fight through my shameill toil and soil submit to the coili won't lose myself (but sure would everything else)heck maybe i already havebut ill come up with more (for i have more in store)and i'll do what it takes to pull throughoh 'corder of 'corders i've filled in your bordersyour seams and your wide open fieldsif its not much trouble (though surely i'd doublemy effort and time put in thee)til i find more grub, i pray you sit stablebut first bring the one i most lovenot alac but ethan the one who raised theei ate tenders chickeni failed to build pygionsublime text i trust has enabled your thrustbut the one true sublime is his faith in minei can no longer bear to be blindi promise you nowthat i'll never forget of you, of your love, of ours.i hope that you knowthat our love is eternalfor cj i'll write every for loop and line (fuck him tho fr)but for you i would lay down my life.the one who gave me a second and third and fourth and fifth and sixth and seventh chancei know there were more, for brevity i'm sure, you'll understand my will to abridgebut in case you dodoubt my love for youi want you to know that i doyou called my worst bluffbrought up my worst stuffyou did what i thought was impossibleyou understood my fears my sins and my heartyou charged my world to do the samenot only me but my whole family will forever be changed by your namei pray every dayyou'll return and I'll staymore innocent than 'fore we first meti know i've atonede'en though i've been stonedand trust i've no greater regret:im sorry i broke your heart and i will not leave this earthwithout putting it back together. never again could i look in your eyes and lie knowing you'd cry or you'd worry. i would break knowing i could break you. i will break to keep you unbroken. and i broke knowing i broke you.it is my greatest regret.not only the lie but the shade and the sighsof indifference i slandered your name with,that i couldn't face the most beautiful faceis a burden i always must bear. but i hope to grow from this burden, this shameand to you share the fruits of my laborfrom my greatest regret my mind has been seton what and who matters to meyour trust is the one thing i'll live for and die for.ill never forget i hurt the greatest one.ill never forget i forgot.the greatest thing that ever happened to me.my guardian angel.my rock.the one.the actual one.my love. &lt;3ethan sneckenberger```-------------------------------------© 2023 Sam Robson</longdescription>
