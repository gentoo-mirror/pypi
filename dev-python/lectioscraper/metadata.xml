	<longdescription># LectioScraperLectioScraper is a python package for helping you scrape lectio.dk with ease. It uses requests for the actual scraping and beautifulsoup for parsing the html.

Here you have everything configured and all you need to do is to import lectioscraper and start scraping (see the whole documentation below).## InstallationUse the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install lectioscraper.```bashpip install lectioscraper```## Usage```pythonimport lectioscraper# Initializes the classclient = lectioscraper.Lectio(&quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;, &quot;schoolId&quot;)# returns your schedule for the day in a json formatclient.getTodaysSchedule(to_json=True)```## ContributingPull requests are welcome.
