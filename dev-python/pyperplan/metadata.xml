	<longdescription>**Pyperplan** is a lightweight STRIPS planner written in Python.Please note that Pyperplan deliberately prefers clean code over fastcode. It is designed to be used as a teaching or prototyping tool. Ifyou use it for paper experiments, please state clearly that Pyperplandoes not offer state-of-the-art performance.It was developed during the planning practical course atAlbert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg during the winter term 2010/2011 andis published under the terms of the GNU General Public License 3(GPLv3).Pyperplan supports the following PDDL fragment: STRIPS without actioncosts.# RequirementsPyperplan requires [Python](https://python.org) &gt;= 3.6.# InstallationFrom the Python package index (PyPI):    pip install pyperplanFrom inside a repository clone:    pip install --editable .This makes the `pyperplan` command available globally or in your [virtualenvironment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) (recommended).# UsageThe `pyperplan` executable accepts two arguments: a PDDL domain file and aPDDL problem file. Example:    pyperplan benchmarks/tpp/domain.pddl benchmarks/tpp/task01.pddlThe domain file can be omitted, in which case the planner will attemptto guess its name based on the problem file. If a plan is found, it isstored alongside the problem file with a .soln extension.By default, the planner performs a blind breadth-first search, whichdoes not scale very well. Heuristic search algorithms are available. Forexample, to use greedy-best-first search with the FF heuristic, run    pyperplan -H hff -s gbf DOMAIN PROBLEMFor a list of available search algorithms and heuristics, run    pyperplan --helpFor more information on using the planner and how to extend it to domore fancy stuff, see the [documentation](doc/documentation.md).# FAQs## PDDL typesPyperplan follows the semantics that all types other than the universalsupertype object (which is mentioned as such in the PDDL 1.2 paper) needto be explicitly introduced.# ContactPyperplan is hosted on GitHub: &lt;https://github.com/aibasel/pyperplan&gt;The original authors of Pyperplan are, in alphabetical order:  - Yusra Alkhazraji  - Matthias Frorath  - Markus Grützner  - Thomas Liebetraut  - Manuela Ortlieb  - Jendrik Seipp  - Tobias Springenberg  - Philip Stahl  - Jan WülfingThe instructors of the course in which Pyperplan was created were MalteHelmert and Robert Mattmüller.If you want to get in touch with us, please contact Robert Mattmüller orJendrik Seipp. Their email addresses can easily be found on the web.# Citing PyperplanPlease cite Pyperplan using    @Misc{alkhazraji-et-al-zenodo2020,      author =       &quot;Yusra Alkhazraji and Matthias Frorath and Markus Gr{\&quot;u}tzner                      and Malte Helmert and Thomas Liebetraut and Robert Mattm{\&quot;u}ller                      and Manuela Ortlieb and Jendrik Seipp and Tobias Springenberg and                      Philip Stahl and Jan W{\&quot;u}lfing&quot;,      title =        &quot;Pyperplan&quot;,      publisher =    &quot;Zenodo&quot;,      year =         &quot;2020&quot;,      doi =          &quot;10.5281/zenodo.3700819&quot;,      url =          &quot;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3700819&quot;,      howpublished = &quot;\url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3700819}&quot;    }</longdescription>
