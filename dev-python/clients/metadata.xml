The primary goals were:* provide a `Client` object with a convenient constructor* support a base url so that requests can provide a relative path* provide the same interface for asyncioSince then [httpx](https://www.encode.io/httpx) has emerged as the successor to `requests`, and supports the above features natively. So `clients.Client` can be replaced with `httpx.Client` for most use cases. The project will continue to be maintained for additional features, such as the `Resource` object.## UsageTypical `requests` usage is redundant and inefficient, by not taking advantage of connection pooling.```pythonr = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', headers={'authorization': token})r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user/repos', headers={'authorization': token})```Using sessions is the better approach, but more verbose and in practice requires manual url joining.```pythons = requests.Session()s.headers['authorization'] = tokenr = s.get('https://api.github.com/user')r = s.get('https://api.github.com/user/repos')```### ClientClients make using sessions easier, with implicit url joining.```pythonclient = clients.Client('https://api.github.com/', headers={'authorization': token})r = client.get('user')r = client.get('user/repos')```### ResourceResources extend Clients to implicitly handle response content, with proper checking of status_code and content-type.```pythongithub = clients.Resource('https://api.github.com/', headers={'authorization': token})for repo in github.get('user/repos', params={'visibility': 'public'}):    ...```Resources also implement syntactic support for methods such as __getattr__ and __call__, providing most of the benefits of custom clients as is.```pythonfor repo in github.user.repos(visibility='public'):    ...```Asynchronous variants of all client types are provided, e.g., `AsyncClient`. Additional clients for [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org), and proxies also provided.## Installation```console% pip install clients```## Dependencies* httpx## Tests100% branch coverage.```console% pytest [--cov]```</longdescription>
