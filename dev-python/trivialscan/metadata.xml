	<longdescription>Trivial Scanner===============|PyPI download month| |PyPi version|Validate the security of your TLS connections so that they deserve yourtrust.Because, no one wants to write several hundred lines of code for everyproject that uses micro-services, internal APIs, zero-trust, etc. whereyou probably should be doing more then just the basic built-in OpenSSLhostname and root trust store checks.Package ``trivialscan`` provides a command-line tool ``trivial``which contacts an SSL/TLS server and obtains some information on itsconfiguration. It aims at providing equal or better functionality ofInternet-based tools like `Qualys SSL ServerTest &lt;https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/&gt;`__ without the requirement ofthe target server being internet connected.You can also use ``trivial scan`` on your internal network, DevOps pipeline, or local computer,to test your servers while they are being developed... |PyPI download month| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/trivialscan.svg   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/trivialscan/.. |PyPi version| image:: https://badgen.net/pypi/v/trivialscan/   :target: https://pypi.com/project/trivialscan</longdescription>
