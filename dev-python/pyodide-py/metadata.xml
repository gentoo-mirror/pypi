	<longdescription># Pyodide Python packageA Python package providing core interpreter functionality for Pyodide.This package is an integral part of the Pyodide runtime which cannot startwithout it. Install in a native Python for type checking or testing purposes.Some of the functionality is missing when imported in a native Python, but forthe APIs we either provide reimplementations or nonfunctional type stubs.## LicensePyodide uses the [Mozilla Public License Version2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mpl-2.0/).## Design information for Pyodide contributorsThis directory consists of two Python packages py/\_pyodide and py/pyodide. Thedifference between these packages is when they are imported. They are bothimported by core/pyodide as a part of setting up the Pyodide/javascript foreignfunction interface.py/\_pyodide is imported as the first step after initializingthe CPython interpreter. py/\_pyodide cannot have any import time dependenciesother than the CPython stdlib.py/pyodide is imported as the final step of core/pyodide. It has an import timedependency on `_pyodide_core` which is a Python C extension assembled bycore/pyodide to serve the needs of py/pyodide.</longdescription>
