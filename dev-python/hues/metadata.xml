	<longdescription># HuesThis is the 90s and your terminal can display _16_ glorious colors. Your Python scripts deserve the some color love. `Hues` makes printing to console in color easy. Just grab the package from `PIP`, and your monochromatic days will be a thing of past!## QuickstartGo, grab the latest version from PIP. Run:```bashpip install hues```Then, in your scripts, do this:```python&gt;&gt;&gt; import hues&gt;&gt;&gt; hues.log('42')&gt;&gt;&gt; hues.info('42')```### Configuration[TODO]_whoa!_All the colors, styles and backgrounds are available as object attributes. The chainable syntax is optimized deterministically using a push down automaton, so when you're being particularly indecisive, you can:```python&gt;&gt;&gt; print(hue('MONDAY!').bold.red.bg_green.underline.bright_yellow)```and there won't be a single trace of `red` in your `bright yellow` message to mondays.Each `hue` string is self closing, so you can't accidentally color your whole terminal yellow because you forgot the `reset` escape sequence.## ColorsAll 16 glorious ANSI colors are available for both background and foreground. Assorted text styles such as **`bold`**, _`italics`_ and &lt;u&gt;`underline`&lt;/u&gt; are also available. Too many colors? Worry not fam, go to town with `reset` attribute.## Todo- [ ] Expand this readme.- [ ] Add screenshots!- [ ] Unicorns required.&gt; Back in my days, we didn't even have colors!</longdescription>
