	<longdescription># kanonym4text K-anonymity guerantee for textsK Anonymity for text (or in short - kanonym4text) is an openâ€‘sourced library that receives a corpus from the user (*dataframe*) and returns a K-anonymized corpus with additional information about the anonymization process performed.kanon4txet is designed to be easily utilized, to **guarantee** anonymization at a certain level pre-defined by the user (k) while still preserving some of the text utilization properties. This repo and package are part of our Y-Data data science final project, and we would love to hear your feedback and learn from it!## OverviewIn this project, we aim to apply data science techniques to anonymize textual data while preserving their utility. K-Anonymity is a technique used to ensure that an individual in a dataset cannot be identified by linking their attributes to external information, by forcing each row to be identical to k-1 other rows The anonymized data can be used for various purposes like data sharing, research, and analysis without compromising privacy. We plan on creating a novel algorithm for k-anonymity. Specifically, we address the case of unstructured data items, such as texts. Using various NLP techniques, from classical to modern DL-based solutions, and testing the utility of the anonymized data.We have tested the library on two main datasets:1) Amazon dataset,2) Enron emails datasetWe show it is able to generate anonymized corpora in both cases.## Package High-Level Algorithm:1) Data Preprocessing: tokenization, lemmatization, and stop word removal.2) K-Anonymization: Generalization and Reduction.3) Evaluation: Utilization is evaluated by embedding distance and semantic scores.4) Visualization: dataset properties prior to and post anonymization will be visualized (optional)# Getting StartedYou can get started with kanonym4text immediately by installing it with pip:## download package```pip install kanonym4text```## Step 1 - creat a data frame from your corpusThe code receives a data frame containing the corpus in the following format:&quot;txt&quot; - column with the texts (default column name)## Step 2 - import the following and initializethe objectUse [gensim word embedding model]([url](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html#pretrained-models)) for you choice (default - *glove-twitter-25*) ```from kanonym4text import Kanonymkan = Kanonym()```## Step 3 - read the df:```import pandas as pddf = pd.read_csv('YOUR_FILE.csv')```## Step 4 -  run the anonymization process on your corpus```dfa, dist = kan.anonymize(df, k=2)```**Running instructions:**The main function is called *anonymize*. It's input parameters are:---------------------------* `df` - Input Dataframe* `k` - k* `col` - The column in df that holds the text to anonymize. Default - txt* `num_stop` - Number of stop word to use. Default - 1000* `num_jobs` - Number of CPUs to utilize. Default - 1. All CPUs - -1.* `verbose` - Output text level. Default - 0.The function outputs are:    ---------------------------A tuple with these items:1. A dataframe - the same df the user sent with additional columns:&gt; 1. general_txt - text after &quot;generalization&quot;&gt; 2. anon_txt_history - changes performed on text during annonymization process:    &gt;       [] - replaced     &gt;       {} - Lemmatize     &gt;       () - protected word (stop-word)     &gt; 3. anon_txt - resulted anonymized text&gt; 4. neighbors - indeces of k neigbors (Bow anonymized)2. An averaged cosine distance of sentence embedding for the documents before and after the anonymizaion# Running Exampleuse the following link to run some examples of the package on your own dataframe:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eMSSvBxtsNFMOvKrUXgbsx1g3KOQD56s#scrollTo=ci2qjboGCt0A&amp;uniqifier=1or use the following code:```from kanonym4text import Kanonymimport pandas as pddf = pd.read_csv('YOUR_FILE.csv')kan = Kanonym('glove-twitter-25') # creating an object from classdfa, dist = kan.anonymize(df, k=k, n_jobs=-1, plot=True)```# Support## Create a Bug ReportIf you see an error message or run into an issue, please create a bug report. This effort is valued and helps all users.## Submit a Feature RequestIf you have an idea, or you're missing a capability that would make development easier and more robust, please Submit a feature request.If a similar feature request already exists, don't forget to leave a &quot;+1&quot;. If you add some more information such as your thoughts and vision about the feature, your comments will be embraced warmly :)# ContributingKanon4txt is an open-source project. We are committed to a fully transparent development process and highly appreciate any contributions. Whether you are helping us fix bugs, proposing new features, improving our documentation, or spreading the word - we would love to have you!</longdescription>
