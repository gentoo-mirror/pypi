	<longdescription>.. default-role:: codeBackground logging support to test libraries============================================This helper module is indented to be used by Robot Framework test librariesthat run keywords in background using threads and that want those threadsto be able to log. By default, as `explained in Robot Framework User Guide`__,messages logged by threads using the programmatic APIs are ignored, and resultsof logging using the standard output are undefined.This module provides a custom logger that works mostly like the standard`robot.api.logger`__, but also stores messages logged by background threads.It also provides a method the main thread can use to forward the loggedmessages to Robot Framework's log.Robot Background Logger is hosted in `Github`__ and downloads can be foundfrom `PYPI`__. Installation is easiest done with pip::    pip install robotbackgroundloggerStarting from version 1.2 this module support both Python 2 and Python 3.__ http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#communication-when-using-threads__ https://robot-framework.readthedocs.org/en/latest/autodoc/robot.api.html#module-robot.api.logger__ https://github.com/robotframework/robotbackgroundlogger__ https://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotbackgroundloggerUsage-----The logger can be taken into use like this:.. sourcecode:: python    from robotbackgroundlogger import BackgroundLogger    logger = BackgroundLogger()After that `logger` can be used mostly like `robot.api.logger`:.. sourcecode:: python    logger.debug('Hello, world!')    logger.info('&lt;b&gt;HTML&lt;/b&gt; example', html=True)When used by the main thread, messages will be logged immediately exactly likewith `robot.api.logger`. When used by other threads, messages will be storedinternally. They can be later logged by the main thread by running:.. sourcecode:: python    logger.log_background_messages()If you want to log only messages logged by a certain thread, you can usepass the name of the thread as an argument:.. sourcecode:: python    logger.log_background_messages('Example thread')Logged messages are also removed from the internal message storage. It ispossible to do that also without logging:.. sourcecode:: python    # Remove all messages    logger.reset_background_messages()    # Remove messages logged by the named thread    logger.reset_background_messages('Another thread')Example-------`example.py`__ library that is used by `example.robot`__ shows how thismodule can be used in practice. You can run the example like::    pybot example.robot__ https://github.com/robotframework/robotbackgroundlogger/blob/master/example.py__ https://github.com/robotframework/robotbackgroundlogger/blob/master/example.robot</longdescription>
