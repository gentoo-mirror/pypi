In preparation.## OverviewIf you find this code useful in producing published works, please provide an appropriate citation.Note that the second citation is focused on adding features that make use of GPR models based on derivative information produced by the core code base.For now, the GPR code, along with more information, may be found under [here][gpr-link].In a future release, we expect this to be fully integrated into the code base rather than a standalone module.Code included here can be used to perform thermodynamic extrapolation andinterpolation of observables calculated from molecular simulations. This allowsfor more efficient use of simulation data for calculating how observables changewith simulation conditions, including temperature, density, pressure, chemicalpotential, or force field parameters. Users are highly encourage to work throughthe [Jupyter Notebooks][notebook-link] presenting examples fora variety of different observable functional forms. We only guarantee that thiscode is functional for the test cases we present here or for which it haspreviously been applied Additionally, the code may be in continuous developmentat any time. Use at your own risk and always check to make sure the producedresults make sense. If bugs are found, please report them. If specific featureswould be helpful just let us know and we will be happy to work with you to comeup with a solution.## Features* Fast calculation of derivatives## StatusThis package is actively used by the author.  Please feel free to create a pull request for wanted features and suggestions!## Quick start`thermoextrap` may be installed with either (recommended)```bashconda install -c wpk-nist thermoextrap```or```bashpip install thermoextrap```If you use pip, then you can include additional dependencies using```bashpip install thermoextrap[all]```If you install `thermoextrap` with conda, there are additional optional dependencies that take some care for installation.  We recommend installing the following via `pip`, as the versions on the conda/conda-forge channels are often a bit old.```bashpip install tensorflow tensorflow-probability gpflow```To install from source do the following:```bashgit clone git@github.com:usnistgov/thermoextrap.gitcd thermoextrappip install . [-e]```To (optionally) include the example data do the following:```bashgit submodule update --init  --recursive```## Example usage```pythonimport thermoextrap```&lt;!-- end-docs --&gt;## DocumentationSee the [documentation][docs-link] for a look at `thermoextrap` in action.To have a look at using `thermoextrap` with Gaussian process regression, look in the [gpr][docs/notebooks/gpr] directory.## LicenseThis is free software.
