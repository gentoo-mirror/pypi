	<longdescription>icn3dpy=======icn3dpy is a simple [IPython/Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) widget toembed an interactive [iCn3D](https://github.com/ncbi/icn3d) viewer in a notebook. Its source code is at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/icn3dpy/), and is also included at [iCn3D GitHub](https://github.com/ncbi/icn3d/tree/master/jupyternotebook).The 3D view of icn3dpy in Jupyter Notebook is interactive, just like in any browser. The popup windows will appear under the 3D view. If you have a predefined cutom view, you can use the predefined commands in icn3dpy as shown below.If you experience problems, please file an [issue](https://github.com/ncbi/icn3d/issues).Installation------------Install icn3dpy:    pip install icn3dpyInstall node if node is unavailable. One way in Mac is to use &quot;brew&quot;:    brew update    brew install node Install Jupyter Lab and the extension &quot;jupyterlab_3dmol&quot;:    pip install jupyterlab    jupyter labextension install jupyterlab_3dmol    or jupyterhub labextension install jupyterlab_3dmolUsage-----Open a notebook:    jupyter notebookand issue Python script as follows:    import icn3dpy&quot;mmdbid&quot; as input:    view = icn3dpy.view(q='mmdbid=6hjr')    viewYou can also try other input besides &quot;mmdbid&quot;.&quot;cid&quot; as input:    view = icn3dpy.view(q='cid=2244')    view&quot;url&quot; as input for local PDB files, e.g., &quot;./1TOP.pdb&quot;:    view = icn3dpy.view(q='url=pdb|./1TOP.pdb')    view&quot;url&quot; as input for remote PDB files:    view = icn3dpy.view(q='url=pdb|https://storage.googleapis.com/membranome-assets/pdb_files/proteins/FCG2A_HUMAN.pdb')    view&quot;url&quot; as input for iCn3D PNG Image files:    view = icn3dpy.view(q='url=icn3dpng|https://api.figshare.com/v2/file/download/39125801')    viewUse predefined commands (The Jupyter Notebook commands can be copied from the &quot;Copy Commands&quot; button in the &quot;File &gt; Share Link&quot; menu of interactive iCn3D viewers in Jupyter Notebook or in a [web browser](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/icn3d/?mmdbid=6m0j)):    view = icn3dpy.view(q='mmdbid=6m0j',command='scatterplot interaction pairs | !A !E | hbonds,salt bridge,interactions,halogen,pi-cation,pi-stacking | false | threshold 3.8 6 4 3.8 6 6; show selection; add residue number labels')    viewEmbed a static image instead of an interactive 3D view to improve the performace of a page with multiple structures. The image is clickable to launch an interactive 3D view. The parameters are separated with the symbol &quot;&amp;&quot; (e.g., &quot;imageonly=1&amp;showanno=1&quot;). All parameters are described in the [&quot;URL parameters&quot; section](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/icn3d/icn3d.html#parameters):    view = icn3dpy.view(q='mmdbid=6hjr', para='imageonly=1')    viewCommand-------You can use iCn3D interactive interface to generate a custom view, then click &quot;File &gt; Share Link&quot; to get the commands in the &quot;Original URL&quot;. All iCn3D commands are listed [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/icn3d/icn3d.html#commands).License-------United States Government Work</longdescription>
