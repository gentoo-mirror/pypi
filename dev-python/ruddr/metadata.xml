	<longdescription>Ruddr=====**Robotic Updater for Dynamic DNS Records**Steer DNS queries to the proper IP addresses. *With support for IPv6!*- PyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/ruddr/][PyPI]- Documentation: [https://ruddr.dcpx.org/][docs]- GitHub: [https://github.com/dominickpastore/ruddr][GitHub]- Changelog:  [https://github.com/dominickpastore/ruddr/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md][changelog]- Issues: [https://github.com/dominickpastore/ruddr/issues][issues]- Discussion: [https://github.com/dominickpastore/ruddr/discussion][discussion]Overview--------Ruddr is a **modular** dynamic DNS client. It separates the job into two tasks:- Detecting IP address changes, handled by *notifiers*.- Publishing the changed addresses, handled by *updaters*Ruddr provides built-in updaters and notifiers for common use cases andservices. For example, the `web` notifier will periodically query awhat-is-my-ip style website, and the `standard` updater uses the de factostandard API, `http(s)://.../nic/update`, to publish updates compatible withseveral well-known services. There are a variety of others; see the [fulldocumentation][docs] for the full list.However, if the built-in notifiers or updaters do not meet your needs, Ruddr is**extensible**. You can easily  write your own and tie it into yourconfiguration. (If you think your custom notifier will be useful to others,feel free to submit a contribution, or you can upload it to PyPI yourself as anextension!)Finally (and the main reason Ruddr was born), Ruddr does its best to makedynamic DNS work with **IPv6**, despite the fact that hosts are not likelybehind network address translation (NAT).For more information about the built-in updaters and notifiers or writing yourown, see the [full documentation][docs].Installation from PyPI----------------------At this time, Ruddr runs on Linux and possibly other Unix-like platforms.Non-Unix-like platforms may be supported in the future.It is available on PyPI under the name [`ruddr`][PyPI]. Basic installationworks similarly to any other Python package:    pip3 install ruddrRuddr is now installed. You can continue to configuration.**Note:** If you would like to use the `systemd` notifier, there are extrasteps. See the installation instructions in the [full documentation][docs] fordetails.Quick Start Guide-----------------1. Write this configuration to `/etc/ruddr.conf`:       [ruddr]       notifier = main       [notifier.main]       type = web       url = https://icanhazip.com/       [updater.main]       # Updater config here2. Paste in one of the updater configurations from the &quot;Updaters&quot; page in the   [full documentation][docs]3. Set up Ruddr to run as a service. If using systemd, create a new unit file   at `/etc/systemd/system/ruddr.service`:       [Unit]       Description=Robotic Updater for Dynamic DNS Records       After=network.target       [Service]       Type=notify       ExecStart=ruddr       NotifyAccess=main       [Install]       WantedBy=multi-user.target   then enable and start the service (as root or with `sudo`):       systemctl enable ruddr       systemctl start ruddr   If not using systemd, then using whatever means your system supports, set   the `ruddr` script to run at startup, with SIGTERM sent to it at shutdown.Full Documentation------------------The full documentation can be found here: [https://ruddr.dcpx.org/][docs]It contains much more information, including the following:- How Ruddr works- Detailed usage and configuration instructions- Descriptions and configuration info for all the built-in updaters and  notifiers- Information for developers, including how to write custom updaters and  notifiers- Frequently asked questions and additional help resources.License-------GNU General Public License version 3 or later.
