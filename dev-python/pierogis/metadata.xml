Ingredients that describe image processing functions can be assembledinto recipes and used to cook an image or animation.```bashpip install pierogispierogis custom teton.png &quot;resize --width 768 --height 768; sort; quantize; resize --scale 4&quot; -o output.png# orpierogis custom teton.png recipe.txt -o output.png````recipe.txt````textresize --width 768 --height 768;sort;quantize -c 000000 ffffff 668a61 cbb8a2 b6d655 434d1f 5fb7d2 6d8ab9 3876c1 515b5e a8725f d7b6aa 3c2329 f78693 637186 00407A;resize -s 4;```&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;sorted and quantized teton&quot; src=&quot;https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/pierogis/pierogis/develop/demo/out/teton.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;- [install](#install)- [features](#features)- [acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)- [issues and contributing](#issues-and-contributing)&lt;a name=&quot;install&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;## install**install from a wheel with pip**```shpip install pierogis```Depends on `numpy` and `PIL`. PIL requires some external C libraries for handling image files. You probably don't haveto worry about this. If you do, try a `conda` installation.To build from source (either the repository or the sdist), you will need to install the rust stable toolchain.```bashcurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | shpip install -r requirements.txtpip install .```Note that the python package was previously called `pyrogis`.That was supposed to denote the difference between the packageand the Rust algorithms (`pierogis_rs`) that it relied on.These two parts were combined into one namespace in the `0.4.0` release,and the split naming became redundant.Still, `pip install pyrogis==0.4.0` will install `pierogis`.&lt;a name=&quot;features&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;## features- **CLI** - Use a `rich` cli to cook Ã  la carte recipes, or provide a recipe in a document (see [docs](https://docs.pierogis.live/en/stable/cli.html))- **Animations** - Animations (gifs and movies) can be cooked in one command- **Extendable** - Easy to create custom manipulations (see [docs](https://docs.pierogis.live/en/stable/ingredients.html#extending))- **Lazy Rendering** - Render a manipulation after constructing your pipeline (see [docs](https://docs.pierogis.live/en/stable/ingredients.html#dish))- **Numpy or Rust backend** - Image processing functions use Numpy for (python relative) fast operations. Some  ingredients use compiled `Rust` for more speed.  &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;terminal screen&quot; src=&quot;https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/pierogis/pierogis/develop/demo/terminal.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;wires recipe&quot; src=&quot;https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/pierogis/pierogis/develop/demo/recipe.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img align=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/pierogis/pierogis/develop/demo/out/wires.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;acknowledgements&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;## acknowledgementsThe original python [pixelsort](https://github.com/satyarth/pixelsort) package inspired this package. While theunderlying [algorithm](https://github.com/kimasendorf/ASDFPixelSort) of that package and of `sort` in this one issupposed to be functionally the same, details of the implementation may differ.A quantization algorithm used in this package uses [`rscolorq`](https://github.com/okaneco/rscolorq), whichis a Rust port of [`scolorq`](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dcoetzee/downloads/scolorq/),itself an implementation of Spatial Color Quantization.An algorithm called[`MMPX`](https://casual-effects.com/research/McGuire2021PixelArt/index.html)is used in this package to do 2x image magnification.It is implemented in a separate [Rust package](https://github.com/pierogis/mmpx-rs).&lt;a name=&quot;issues-and-contributing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;## issues and contributingWhen you encounter an error, there are some guidelines that will make it easier to help you:- Ensure that you are using the latest version of the package. It's early days so errors and updates will be frequent.  Use `pip uninstall pierogis` then `pip install pierogis --no-cache-dir` to reinstall.- Provide the version of `pierogis` that you are using in issues to rule that out.  `pip list` -&gt; pierogis \_.\_.\_- Provide the traceback or error message if relevant.- Provide your os and any other specific information about how you are trying to use the package.- Provide the code or the cli command that triggered the error.- If the problem is visual: that can be more difficult to debug. Share a link to an image hosting site if you want to  share what you are seeing in an issue.- If you are getting different behavior than you expect: that could be an error or a feature.- If your problem is with installation: try conda, preinstall `numpy` and `pillow`, install the rust toolchain, and  start praying. There will be a website with a visual editor for this software so stay tuned.Hopefully all levels of skills can use this package. Any form of contributing is appreciated; passive-aggressivesemi-anonymous thumbs down is not appreciated.Everyone using and contributing to this package is doing it for the love of the game.Don't feel like your issue is too small to make an issue.
