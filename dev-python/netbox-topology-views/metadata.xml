It is recommended to set this field to &quot;UI visibility&quot; &quot;Hidden&quot; and let the plugin manage it in the background.The coordinates are stored as: &quot;X;Y&quot;.Please read the &quot;Configure&quot; chapter to set the `allow_coordinates_saving` option to True.You might also set the `always_save_coordinates` option to True.## ConfigureAll individual options can be assigned a default value per user directly in the plugin. The default value can be overridden on the filter page.The remaining options must be configured in the `PLUGINS_CONFIG` section of your `netbox/configuration.py`.Example:```PLUGINS_CONFIG = {    'netbox_topology_views': {        'static_image_directory': 'netbox_topology_views/img',        'allow_coordinates_saving': True,        'always_save_coordinates': True    }}```| Setting                  | Default value                                                                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                            || ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- || static_image_directory   | netbox_topology_views/img                                                                                                                      | (str or pathlib.Path) Specifies the location that images will be loaded from by default.

You can also upload you own custom images to there - these images will automatically be used for a device (if it does not already have a specified image in the settings) if their name is the device role slug.## UseGo to the plugins tab in the navbar and click topology or go to `$NETBOX_URL/plugins/netbox_topology_views/` to view your topologiesSelect your options for the topology view:![selection_options](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20901110/220410144-5633d24c-6383-4cba-8d6d-ba77ef3d3cdd.png)&lt;dl&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Save Coordinates&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;Save the coordinates of devices in the topology view.&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Show Unconnected&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;Show devices that have no connections or for which no connection is displayed. This option depends on other parameters like 'Show Cables' and 'Show Logical Connections'.&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Show Circuit Terminations&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;Show connections which end at a circuit termination in the topology view. These connections are displayed as blue dashed lines.&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Show Cables&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;Show connections between interfaces, front / rear ports, etc., that are connected with one or more cables. These connections are displayed as solid lines in the color of the cable.&lt;/dd&gt;     &lt;dt&gt;Show Logical Connections&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;Show logical connections between interfaces (referred to as Interface Connections in NetBox) in the topology view. Where the path between        interfaces includes multiple cables (e.g., via patch panels), only the end interface connections are shown, not the         intermediate front / rear port connections, etc. This is similar to what was referred to as 'end-to-end' connections in previous versions. These connections are displayed as yellow dotted lines.&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Show redundant Cable and Locigal Connection&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;Shows a logical connection (in addition to a cable), even if a cable is directly connected. Leaving this option disabled prevents that redundant display. This option only has an effect if 'Show Logical Connections' is activated.&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Show Power Feeds&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;Displays connections between power outlets and power ports. These connections are displayed as solid lines in the color of the cable. This option depends on 'Show Cables'.&lt;/dd&gt;    &lt;dt&gt;Show Wireless Links&lt;/dt&gt;    &lt;dd&gt;Displays wireless connections. These connections are displayed as blue dotted lines.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;    ### UpdateRun `pip install netbox-topology-views --upgrade` in your venv.Run `python3 manage.py migrate netbox_topology_views`Run `python3 manage.py collectstatic --no-input`Clear you browser cache.### PermissionsTo view `/plugins/netbox_topology-views/topology` you need the following permissions: + dcim | device | can view device + dcim | site | can view site + extras | tag | can view tag + dcim | device role | can view device roleTo view `/plugins/netbox_topology-views/image`: + dcim | site | view + dcim | device role | view + dcim | device role | add + dcim | device role | change To view `/plugins/netbox_topology-views/individualoptions`: + netbox topology views | individualoptions | change ## Icons infoPower icons created by [Freepik - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/power).Power icons created by [Flat Icons - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/power)Provider icons created by [Good Ware - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/provider)</longdescription>
