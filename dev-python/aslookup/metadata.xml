	<longdescription># aslookupPython client for IP to ASN lookup servicesaslookup is a client utility for two of the public IP/AS query servicesoperated by the following organizations:* Shadowserver -- https://www.shadowserver.org/wiki/pmwiki.php/Services/IP-BGP* Team Cymru -- http://www.team-cymru.org/IP-ASN-mapping.htmlThe client implements both a simple Python module (aslookup) as well as a CLIutility (`as-lookup`). The lookups are currently done using DNS, which workswell for a one-off lookups. It is not optimized for bulk lookups over theWhois protocol.Currently only IPv4 addresses are looked up. The client also maintains alisting of IP networks which are unroutable internet addresses, typicallyspecial use ranges in RFCs. In this way it can both filter out addresses fromqueries which are a waste of time, as well as provide context to the user onthe address.## InstallationThe app has been tested on Python 3.It's best to install the program into a Python virtualenv. If you will only usethe command line interface, the recommended way to install it is using[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):    pipx install aslookupIf you will use aslookup as a library, you'll instead want to install it using`pip` in your target Python environment:    python3 -m pip install aslookup## Usage### Python moduleThe Python module defaults to querying the Team Cymru data service. Thedesired service may be specified by passing the *service* parameter to`get_as_data`.```pythonfrom aslookup import get_as_dataip = &quot;8.8.8.8&quot;get_as_data(ip, service=&quot;shadowserver&quot;)```### CLI scriptIt is possible to provide multiple IP addresses as arguments to the script, or to send them as a list on standard input, in which cases the script loops over them and returns output on separate lines. When providing invalid IPv4 addresses as arguments, the script reports the problem on standard error and exits with an error. When providing input on stdin, the error is reported on standard output but execution is not aborted.    as-lookup 8.8.8.8 9.9.9.9or:    as-lookup &lt; ipaddrs.txt### Test dataA list of test values for the script is included in the file `tests/test_input.txt`.This can be useful to validate included IP prefix classifications and see theoutput format.    as-lookup &lt; tests/test_input.txt</longdescription>
