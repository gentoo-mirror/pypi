	<longdescription># Matplotlib Inline Back-end for IPython and JupyterThis package provides support for matplotlib to display figures directly inline in the Jupyter notebook and related clients, as shown below.## InstallationWith conda:```bashconda install -c conda-forge matplotlib-inline```With pip:```bashpip install matplotlib-inline```## UsageNote that in current versions of JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook, the explicit use of the `%matplotlib inline` directive is not needed anymore, though other third-party clients may still require it.This will produce a figure immediately below:```python%matplotlib inlineimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npx = np.linspace(0, 3*np.pi, 500)plt.plot(x, np.sin(x**2))plt.title('A simple chirp');```## LicenseLicensed under the terms of the BSD 3-Clause License, by the IPython Development Team (see `LICENSE` file).BSD 3-Clause LicenseCopyright (c) 2019-2022, IPython Development Team.All rights reserved.Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or withoutmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:1.
