	<longdescription>[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JakubTesarek/kwargs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JakubTesarek/kwargs)# KwargsKwargs is the only True python micro-framework that doesn't limit your creativityâ„¢.## RequirmentsYou need [Python &gt;= 3.3](https://travis-ci.org/JakubTesarek/kwargs). You canprobably use it with older versions, including Python 2 but our buid dependeciesdon't work in this version so we are not testing it.## InstallationKwargs is self-contained so you can simply copy-paste kwargs.py to your project.We are also working on creating a pypi project. Stay tuned.## Usage### Basic usage```pythonfrom kwargs import Appdef my_function():# implement your app logicreturnapp = App(my_function)app.run()````App(my_function)` initializes Kwargs framework with your app logic. You have toimplement this logic yourself. It can do literally anything!When you want to then execute your code, simply call `app.run()`.### Shorthand usage (for lead developers)Kwargs framework strifes for short and easy to read code. Therefore it provides you with shorthand execution. ```pythonfrom kwargs import rundef my_function():# implement your app logicreturnrun(my_function)```### Super-short usage (for hackers)You can also skip initialization of Kwargs framework altogether and executethe app logic yourself.```pythondef my_function():# implement your app logicreturnmy_function()```Notice that you don't have to import Kwargs package anymore. It's because inthis example we don't use it at all. Magic!We don't recommend using this style as it might be confusing for other developers that are not familiar with Kwargs framework. But heck, sometimes you just need to get job done.## Contributing- Create a branch. Only I can commit to master because it's my repository.- Run tests with code coverage `$ py.test --cov=kwargs`- Run pylint `$ pylint kwargs tests`## FAQ### Is Kwargs the right framework for my project?Kwarks is currently the fastest python framework with minimum overhead and it doesn'tlimit usage of other tools and frameworks. As such it fits projects of all sizes.But it's specially good when you're writing small utility and your manager keeps askingwhat framework you use.### What should do I do when I find a bug?Before you submit pull request or file a ticket, please search Stack Owerflow. We have more then [36.000 answered questions](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=kwargs) so you might find help there. If you still think, you find a bug, [file a ticket](https://github.com/JakubTesarek/kwargs/issues) or send a pull request.</longdescription>
