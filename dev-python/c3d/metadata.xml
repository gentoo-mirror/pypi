	<longdescription>py-c3d======This is a small library for reading and writing C3D binary files. C3D files area standard format for recording 3-dimensional time sequence data, especiallydata recorded by a 3D motion tracking apparatus.Installing----------Install with pip::    pip install c3dOr if you'd like to use the bleeding-edge version, just clone the githubrepository and build and install using the normal Python setup process::    pip install git+https://github.com/EmbodiedCognition/py-c3dUsage-----Tools~~~~~This package includes a script for converting C3D motion data to CSV format(``c3d2csv``) and an OpenGL-based visualization tool for observing the motiondescribed by a C3D file (``c3d-viewer``).Note for the viewer you need to install `pyglet`.This can be done by installing the gui extra of py-c3d::    pip install &quot;c3d[gui]&quot;Library~~~~~~~To use the C3D library, just import the package and create a ``Reader`` or``Writer`` depending on your intended usage.. code-block:: python    import c3d    with open('data.c3d', 'rb') as handle:        reader = c3d.Reader(handle)        for i, (points, analog) in enumerate(reader.read_frames()):            print('Frame {}: {}'.format(i, points.round(2)))You can also get and set metadata fields using the library; see the `packagedocumentation`_ for more details... _package documentation: http://c3d.readthedocs.orgDeveloper Install~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~To work on `c3d`, first install `poetry &lt;https://python-poetry.org&gt;`_ and then run::    git clone https://github.com/EmbodiedCognition/py-c3d    cd py-c3d    poetry installThis will create a new virtual environment with all the required dependency and `c3d` in develop mode.Tests~~~~~To run tests available in the test folder, following command can be run from the root of the package directory::    python -m unittest discover .Test scripts will automatically download test files from `c3d.org`_... _c3d.org: https://www.c3d.org/sampledata.htmlCaveats-------This library is minimally effective, in the sense that the only motion trackingsystem I have access to (for testing) is a Phasespace system. If you try out thelibrary and find that it doesn't work with your motion tracking system, let meknow. Pull requests are also welcome!Also, if you're looking for more functionality than just reading and writing C3Dfiles, there are a lot of better toolkits out there that support a lot more fileformats and provide more functionality, perhaps at the cost of increasedcomplexity. The `biomechanical toolkit`_ is a good package for analyzing motiondata... _biomechanical toolkit: http://code.google.com/p/b-tk/</longdescription>
