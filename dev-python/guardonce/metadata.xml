	<longdescription>Why Convert?------------Include guards suck. They're tiring to type and tedius to update. Worse,the task of updating boilerplate leaves room for copy/paste errors, orother mistakes. #pragma once is simpler and less error prone. That's whyyou should convert to #pragma once.Alas, though #pragma once is available on all the most commonly usedcompilers, it's not available on *every* compiler. Perhaps one dayyou'll add support for a platform with a barebones compiler with nosupport for #pragma once and you'll have to convert back. That's ok.It's easy!What exactly is guardonce?--------------------------There are three main tools provided by guardonce:1. ``checkguard`` helps find any broken include guards you may already   have in your project. These should be addressed before converting.2. ``guard2once`` converts files with include guards into files with   #pragma once directives. This ensures your entire project is   consistently using #pragma once.3. ``once2guard`` converts files with #pragma once directives back into   files with include guards. This ensures your entire project is   consistently using include guards.How to use:-----------First, check your project for broken headers. To recursively search yourproject directories for the names of all files that lack proper includeguards, use the following command, substituting your project's directoryfor the quoted string:``checkguard -r &quot;source_directory&quot;``By default, checkguard is very forgiving. It accepts either #pragma onceor anything that looks like an include guard. If you know that all yourguards should match some format, you can be more strict by using ``-p``to specify a pattern to check against.If certain files are not supposed to have include guards, feel free toleave them be. Files without include guards are ignored by this nextstep.Now, all that remains is converting the headers to use #pragma once:``guard2once -r &quot;source_directory&quot;``You're done! Double check that the result matches your expectations andstart using #pragma once in your new code. Know that if you ever need toswitch back, it's as simple as:``once2guard -r &quot;source_directory&quot;``If the default guard style doesn't appeal to you, there are a fewoptions to customize it. Maybe take a look through ``once2guard --help``or check out a walkthrough for some examples.</longdescription>
