	<longdescription>The iisignature package=======================This package provides tools for calculating the signature and log signature of a data stream. These are summary statistics of piecewise linear paths, consisting of iterated integrals, inspired by rough path theory. See &lt;https://github.com/bottler/phd-docs/blob/master/iisignature.pdf&gt; for documentation, the page&lt;https://github.com/bottler/phd-docs&gt; for more information about the calculations, and &lt;https://github.com/bottler/iisignature&gt; for source code.It is work in progress.Python------Install with::    pip install iisignatureDon't install this package if you don't have numpy &gt; 1.7 installed. On Windows, this package is not usable with Python 2.x. For Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 on Windows, there are precompiled wheels available, you may need to do ``pip install wheel`` to use them.On other platforms, you will need to be able to compile C++ extensions. On a Mac, you will need to have installed Xcode and the Xcode command line tools before doing the installation.The fastest, on-the-fly compiled versions of the log signature calculations are for Windows, Mac and Linux, on both 32 and 64 bit.Sometimes there are compile errors on a Mac, if this happens try::    MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 pip install iisignatureUse without installing a released version-----------------------------------------To install the current &quot;master&quot; development version straight from github you can type::    pip install git+git://github.com/bottler/iisignature&gt;From a checkout of this repository, you can build the extension and run the tests using::    python setup.py test&gt;From a checkout of this repository, you can build the extension into this directory itself using::    python setup.py build_ext --inplaceafter which you can use the package in Python in this directory, use the examples in the ``examples`` directory, or add this directory to your PYTHONPATH and then use the package in Python anywhere.Authors-------* Benjamin Graham* Jeremy ReizensteinThanks------This package includes BCH coefficients from Fernando Casas and Ander Murua.&lt;http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2656&gt;</longdescription>
