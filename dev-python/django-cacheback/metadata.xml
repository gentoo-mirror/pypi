	<longdescription>=========Cacheback=========----------------------------------------Asynchronous cache refreshing for Django----------------------------------------What does this library do?--------------------------It's an extensible caching library that refreshes stale cache itemsasynchronously using a Celery_ or rq_ task (utilizing django-rq). The keyidea being that it's better to serve a stale item (and populate the cacheasynchronously) than block the response process in order to populate the cachesynchronously... _Celery: http://celeryproject.org/.. _rq: http://python-rq.org/Using this library, you can rework your views so that all reads are fromcache - which can be a significant performance boost.A corollary of this technique is that cache hammering can be handled simply andelegantly, avoiding sudden surges of expensive reads when a cached item becomes stale.Do you have good docs?----------------------Yup - `over on readthedocs.org`_... _`over on readthedocs.org`: http://django-cacheback.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Supported versions------------------Python 3.6+ is supported.
