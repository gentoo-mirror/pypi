It exposes statefulprogramming constructs that makes things like enforcing the stateof an application, configuration, SaaS system, or others verysimple.Since Idem is a programming language, it can also be used for dataprocessing and pipelining. Idem can be used not only to managethe configuration of interfaces, but also for complex rule enginesand processing files or workflows.Idem is a language to glue together management of all sorts ofinterfaces. You can think of it like having idempotentscripts. Automation that can be run over and over again thatenforces a specific state or process.Idem is unique in that it is built purely as a language. Itcan be added to any type of management system out there and canbe applied in a cross platform way easily.Idem's functionality can also be expanded easily. Instead of storingall of the language components in a single place, the librariesused by Idem can be written independently and seamlessly mergedinto Idem, just like a normal programming language!* `Idem Website &lt;https://www.idemproject.io/&gt;`__* `Idem Source Code &lt;https://gitlab.com/vmware/idem/idem&gt;`__* `Idem Project Docs &lt;https://docs.idemproject.io/&gt;`__What does Idempotent mean?==========================The concept of Idempotent is simple! It just means that every timesomething is run, it always has the same end result regardless of the stateof a system when the run starts!At first glance this might seem useless, but think more deeply. Have youever needed to make sure that something was set up in a consistent way? Itcan be very nice to be able to enforce that setup without worrying aboutbreaking it. Or think about data pipelines, have you ever had input datathat needed to be processed? Idempotent systems allow for data to beeasily processed in a consistent way, over and over again!How Does This Language Work?============================Idem works by taking language files called ``sls`` files and compiling themdown to data instructions. These data instructions are then run through theIdem runtime. These instructions inform Idem what routines to call toenforce state or process data. It allows you to take a high level datasetas your input, making the use of the system very easy.Idem is built using two critical technologies: ``Python`` and ``POP``. Since Idemis built on Python, it should be easy to extend for most software developers.Extending Idem can be very easy because simple Python modules are all you needto add capabilities!The other technology, ``POP``, may be new to you. This is the truly secret saucebehind Idem as well as a number of emerging exciting technologies. ``POP`` standsfor *Plugin Oriented Programming*. It is the brainchild of `the creator ofSalt &lt;https://github.com/thatch45&gt;`__ and a new way to write software. The ``POP``system makes the creation of higher level paradigms like Idem possible, but alsoprovides the needed components to make Idem extensible and flexible.For more information on ``POP``:* `Intro to Plugin Oriented Programming (POP) &lt;https://pop-book.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`__* `pop documentation &lt;https://pop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`__* `pop-awesome &lt;https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/pop-awesome&gt;`__* `pop-create &lt;https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/pop-create/&gt;`__Paradigms and Languages, This Sounds Complicated!=================================================Under the hood, it is complicated! The guts of a programming language arecomplicated, but it is all there to make your life easier! You don't need tounderstand complex computer science theory to benefit from Idem. You just needto learn a few simple things and you can start making your life easier today!</longdescription>
