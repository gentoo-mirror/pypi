	<longdescription># NotCLI - An Interactive TUI Application`notcli` is a Textual User Interface (TUI) application designed to streamline your command line tasks with easy-to-use shortcuts. The application leverages the power of Python's `argparse` and `rich` libraries to provide an intuitive interface, and the `textual` library for an interactive user experience.## Features- **Interactive Textual-based User Interface**: Enjoy the power of command-line interfaces with the usability and aesthetics of a GUI.- **Load Variables from a File**: Manage your environment variables with ease. Load variables from a file and export them to the environment.- **Error Handling and Display**: When something goes wrong, `notcli` provides meaningful error messages through customizable error screens.- **Shortcut Bindings**: Make your tasks quicker with shortcut bindings, enabling fast access to your favorite commands.- **Extendable**: The design of `notcli` is such that more features and shortcuts can be added in the future to cater to a wide range of use-cases.## InstallationYou can install `notcli` using pip:```shellpip install notcli```## Usage`notcli` is designed to bring simplicity and efficiency to your command line tasks. To use `notcli`, simply call it from the command line followed by the appropriate command:```shellnotcli loadvars```This command will launch the Textual interface, providing you with an interactive session where you can select the file that contains your environment variables. Once the file is selected, `notcli` will load these variables into your environment.If `notcli` encounters an error, such as an issue reading the file or loading the variables, it will bring up an error screen with the details of the error.
