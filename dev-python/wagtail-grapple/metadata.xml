The setup and configuration have been designedto be as simple but also provide the best features;No complex serializers need to be written - just add a `graphql_fields` listto your model and away you go (although if you want to go deeper you can!).### Features-   Easily create GraphQL types by adding a small annotation in your models.-   Supports traditional Wagtail models:    -   Pages (including Streamfield &amp; Orderables)    -   Snippets    -   Images    -   Documents    -   Media    -   Settings    -   Redirects    -   Search (on all models)-   Custom Image &amp; Document model support-   Pagination support-   Middleware support-   Advanced headless preview functionality built using GraphQL Subscriptions to enable Page previews on any device!### Built WithThis library is an abstraction upon and relies heavily on Graphene &amp; Graphene Django.We also use Django Channels and the Potrace image library.-   [Graphene](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene)-   [Graphene Django](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene)-   [Potrace](https://github.com/skyrpex/potrace)-   [Django Channels](https://github.com/django/channels) when installed with `wagtail_grapple[channels]`## Getting StartedGetting Grapple installed is designed to be as simple as possible!### Prerequisites```Django  &gt;= 3.2, &lt;4.0Wagtail &gt;= 2.15, &lt;5.0```### Installation```bashpip install wagtail_grapple```Add the following to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your Wagtail settings file:```pythonINSTALLED_APPS = [    # ...    &quot;grapple&quot;,    &quot;graphene_django&quot;,    # ...]```For GraphQL Subscriptions with Django Channels, run `pip install wagtail_grapple[channels]` and add`channels` to installed apps:```pythonINSTALLED_APPS = [    # ...    &quot;grapple&quot;,    &quot;graphene_django&quot;,    &quot;channels&quot;,    # ...]```Add the following to the bottom of the same settings file, where each key is the app you want to this library to scan and the value is the prefix you want to give to GraphQL types (you can usually leave this blank):```python# Grapple config:GRAPHENE = {&quot;SCHEMA&quot;: &quot;grapple.schema.schema&quot;}GRAPPLE = {    &quot;APPS&quot;: [&quot;home&quot;],}```Add the GraphQL URLs to your `urls.py`:```pythonfrom grapple import urls as grapple_urls# ...urlpatterns = [    # ...    path(&quot;api/&quot;, include(grapple_urls)),    # ...]```Done! Now you can proceed onto configuring your models to generate GraphQL types that adopt their structure :tada:_Your GraphQL endpoint is available at [http://localhost:8000/api/graphql/](http://localhost:8000/api/graphql/)_## UsageHere is a GraphQL model configuration for the default page from the Wagtail docs:```python# ...from grapple.models import GraphQLString, GraphQLStreamfieldclass BlogPage(Page):    author = models.CharField(max_length=255)    date = models.DateField(&quot;Post date&quot;)    body = StreamField(        [            (&quot;heading&quot;, blocks.CharBlock(classname=&quot;full title&quot;)),            (&quot;paragraph&quot;, blocks.RichTextBlock()),            (&quot;image&quot;, ImageChooserBlock()),        ]    )    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [        FieldPanel(&quot;author&quot;),        FieldPanel(&quot;date&quot;),        StreamFieldPanel(&quot;body&quot;),    ]    # Note these fields below:    graphql_fields = [        GraphQLString(&quot;heading&quot;),        GraphQLString(&quot;date&quot;),        GraphQLString(&quot;author&quot;),        GraphQLStreamfield(&quot;body&quot;),    ]```_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://wagtail-grapple.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)_## ContributingContributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.Any contributions [you make](https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail-grapple/graphs/contributors) are **greatly appreciated**.1.
