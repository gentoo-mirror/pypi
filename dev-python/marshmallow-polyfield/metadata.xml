For 2.0 support see `The 2.0 branch &lt;https://github.com/Bachmann1234/marshmallow-polyfield/tree/polyfield-2support&gt;`_ An unofficial extension to Marshmallow to allow for polymorphic fields.Marshmallow is a fantastic library for serialization and deserialization of data.For more on that project see its `GitHub &lt;https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow&gt;`_ page or its `Documentation &lt;http://marshmallow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&gt;`_.This project adds a custom field designed for polymorphic types. This allows you to define a schema that says &quot;This field accepts anything of type X&quot;The secret to this field is that you need to define two functions. One to be used when serializing, and another for deserializing. These functionstake in the raw value and return the schema to use.This field should support the same properties as other Marshmallow fields. I have worked with *required* *allow_none* and *many*.Last version support v2 is tagged FINAL_V2_VERSIONInstalling----------::    $ pip install marshmallow-polyfieldImporting---------Here is how to import the necessary field class::    from marshmallow_polyfield import PolyFieldExample-------The code below demonstrates how to setup a schema with a PolyField. For the full context check out the tests.Once setup the schema should act like any other schema. If it does not then please file an Issue... code:: python    def shape_schema_serialization_disambiguation(base_object, parent_obj):        class_to_schema = {            Rectangle.__name__: RectangleSchema,            Triangle.__name__: TriangleSchema        }        try:            return class_to_schema[base_object.__class__.__name__]()        except KeyError:            pass        raise TypeError(&quot;Could not detect type. &quot;                        &quot;Did not have a base or a length. &quot;                        &quot;Are you sure this is a shape?&quot;)    def shape_schema_deserialization_disambiguation(object_dict, parent_object_dict):        if object_dict.get(&quot;base&quot;):            return TriangleSchema()        elif object_dict.get(&quot;length&quot;):            return RectangleSchema()        raise TypeError(&quot;Could not detect type. &quot;                        &quot;Did not have a base or a length. &quot;                        &quot;Are you sure this is a shape?&quot;)    class ContrivedShapeClass(object):        def __init__(self, main, others):            self.main = main            self.others = others        def __eq__(self, other):            return self.__dict__ == other.__dict__    class ContrivedShapeClassSchema(Schema):        main = PolyField(            serialization_schema_selector=shape_schema_serialization_disambiguation,            deserialization_schema_selector=shape_schema_deserialization_disambiguation,            required=True        )        others = PolyField(            serialization_schema_selector=shape_schema_serialization_disambiguation,            deserialization_schema_selector=shape_schema_deserialization_disambiguation,            allow_none=True,            many=True        )        @post_load        def make_object(self, data):            return TestPolyField.ContrivedShapeClass(                data.get('main'),                data.get('others')            )</longdescription>
