	<longdescription>dbus-deviation==============dbus-deviation is a project for parsing D-Bus introspection XML and processingit in various ways. Its main tool is dbus-interface-diff, which calculates thedifference between two D-Bus APIs for the purpose of checking for API breaks.This functionality is also available as a Python module, dbusdeviation.A second Python module, dbusapi, is provided for parsing D-Bus introspectionXML to produce an AST representing a D-Bus interface.dbus-deviation’s API is currently unstable and is likely to change wildly.Using dbus-deviation====================dbus-deviation can be used as a utility program or as a Python library.The utility programs: - dbus-interface-diff:     Check for differences between two versions of the same D-Bus API and     print details of each difference. It can check for problems with forwards     and backwards compatibility, as well as general informational     differences.     Example:       dbus-interface-diff \           com.example.Interface1.xml \  # old version of the interface           com.example.Interface2.xml    # new version of the interface - dbus-interface-vcs-helper:     This is a helper program designed to be used by dbus-deviation.mk.As a library, the core object is an InterfaceParser, allowing a D-Bus API tobe parsed and represented as an AST. See the API documentation for moreexplanation and examples.dbus-deviation.mk-----------------This is a Makefile snippet which should be copied into your project, added togit, and the following two lines included in your top-level Makefile.am:```dbus_api_xml_files = list of D-Bus interface XML files-include $(top_srcdir)/dbus-deviation.mk```Do not add it to EXTRA_DIST. It is designed to work from git checkouts only.Then run:```make dbus-deviation-mk-install```to set up the API signature database. This assumes that your project definesD-Bus interfaces in XML files, and does not generate them at runtime.Finally, copy pre-push.hook to .git/hooks/pre-push and ensure it’s executable.This script will automatically update the API signature database when a newrelease tag is pushed to the git remote.There is currently no streamlined support for projects which generate D-Businterfaces at runtime.dbus-deviation.mk defines the following rules: - dist-dbus-api-compatibility (a dependency of dist-hook) - check-dbus-api-compatibility (a dependency of check-local) - dbus-deviation-mk-install (never triggered automatically)Dependencies============ - argparse - lxmlDevelopment===========For fun, dbus-deviation uses the following services to do continuousintegration and gather build statistics: - https://travis-ci.org/pwithnall/dbus-deviation - https://landscape.io/github/pwithnall/dbus-deviation - https://coveralls.io/r/pwithnall/dbus-deviation - https://codecov.io/github/pwithnall/dbus-deviationLicensing=========dbus-deviation is licensed under the LGPL version 2.1 (or, at your option, anylater version). See COPYING for more details.dbus-deviation versions 0.4.0 and earlier were licensed under the choice of theAcademic Free License version 2.1, or the GNU General Public License version 2(or, at your option, any later version). This is the same license as D-Busitself. Version 0.5.0 was relicensed to LGPLv2.1+ as it’s a more standard licensewith less ambiguity about its implications.Bugs====Bug reports and patches should be sent via GitHub or Gitlab: - https://github.com/pwithnall/dbus-deviation - https://gitlab.com/dbus-deviation/dbus-deviationContact=======Philip Withnall &lt;philip@tecnocode.co.uk&gt;https://tecnocode.co.uk/dbus-deviation/Overview of changes from dbus-deviation 0.6.0 to dbus-deviation 0.6.1=====================================================================Major changes: - Drop support for Python 2.7 - Move to pycodestyle from pep8 and drop setup.py requirement for it - Minor maintenance documentation updatesOverview of changes from dbus-deviation 0.5.0 to dbus-deviation 0.6.0=====================================================================Major changes: - Split out the logging API to allow for reuse - Expose source line numbers in dbusapi.ast - Add a D-Bus type parser, dbusapi.typeparser (thanks to Kaloyan Tenchov) - Drop Python 3.3 support as Sphinx no longer supports it - Add a D-Bus type formatter, dbusapi.typeformatterOverview of changes from dbus-deviation 0.4.0 to dbus-deviation 0.5.0=====================================================================Major changes: - Add support for &lt;node&gt; elements (Kaloyan Tenchov) - Add object path, interface name and callable name validation   (Kaloyan Tenchov) - Relicense to LGPLv2.1+Overview of changes from dbus-deviation 0.3.0 to dbus-deviation 0.4.0=====================================================================Major changes: - Improve test coverage - Port to lxml instead of xml.etree - Support parsing comments and documentation nodesOverview of changes from dbus-deviation 0.2.0 to dbus-deviation 0.3.0=====================================================================Major changes: - Improve utility arguments and variables in dbus-deviation.mk and vcs-helperOverview of changes from dbus-deviation 0.1.0 to dbus-deviation 0.2.0=====================================================================Major changes: - Improve error reporting - Improve test coverage - Add Makefile snippet and helper program (vcs-helper) for use in other   projectsInitial release of dbus-deviation 0.1.0=======================================Major changes: - Initial version of the project</longdescription>
