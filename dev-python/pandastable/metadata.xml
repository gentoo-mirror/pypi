	<longdescription>Introduction------------The pandastable library provides a table widget for Tkinter withplotting and data manipulation functionality. It uses the pandasDataFrame class to store table data. Pandas is an open source Pythonlibrary providing high-performance data structures and data analysistools. Tkinter is the standard GUI toolkit for python. It is intendedfor the following uses:-  for python/tkinter GUI developers who want to include a table in   their application that can store and process large amounts of data-  for non-programmers who are not familiar with Python or the pandas   API and want to use the included DataExplore application to   manipulate/view their data-  it may also be useful for data analysts and programmers who want to   get an initial interactive look at their tabular data without codingThe DataExplore application---------------------------Installing the package creates a command *dataexplore* in your path.Just run this to open the program. This is a standalone application fordata manipulation and plotting meant for education and basic dataanalysis.
