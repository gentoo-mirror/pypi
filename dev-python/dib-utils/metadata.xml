	<longdescription>Standalone tools related to diskimage-builder=============================================These tools were originally part of the diskimage-builder project, but they haveuses outside of that project as well.  Because disk space is at a premium inbase cloud images, pulling in all of diskimage-builder and its dependencies just touse something like dib-run-parts is not desirable.  This project allows consumersto use the tools while pulling in only one small package with few/no additionaldependencies.</longdescription>
