Alongsidethe python package that provides the main functionality, the JupyterLabextension (`@jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy`) provides buttons in theJupyterLab launcher window to get to RStudio for example.**Note:** This project used to be called **nbserverproxy**. Asnbserverproxy is an older version of jupyter-server-proxy, uninstallnbserverproxy before installing jupyter-server-proxy to avoid conflicts.The primary use cases are:1.  Use with JupyterHub / Binder to allow launching users into web    interfaces that have nothing to do with Jupyter - such as RStudio,    Shiny, or OpenRefine.2.  Allow access from frontend javascript (in classic notebook or    JupyterLab extensions) to access web APIs of other processes running    locally in a safe manner. This is used by the [JupyterLab    extension](https://github.com/dask/dask-labextension) for    [dask](https://www.dask.org/).[The documentation](https://jupyter-server-proxy.readthedocs.io/)contains information on installation &amp; usage.## Security warningJupyter Server Proxy is often used to start a user defined process listening tosome network port (e.g. `http://localhost:4567`) for a user starting a Jupyter Serverthat only that user has permission to access. The user can then access thestarted process proxied through the Jupyter Server.For safe use of Jupyter Server Proxy, you should ensure that the process startedby Jupyter Server proxy can't be accessed directly by another user and bypassthe Jupyter Server's authorization!A common strategy to enforce access proxied via Jupyter Server is to startJupyter Server within a container and only allow network access to the JupyterServer via the container.&gt; For more insights, see [Ryan Lovett's comment about&gt; it](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/pull/359#issuecomment-1350118197).## Install### RequirementsEither `jupyterlab&gt;=3` or `notebook` is required.### Python package#### `pip````bashpip install jupyter-server-proxy```#### `conda````bashconda install jupyter-server-proxy -c conda-forge```### JupyterLab extensionA JupyterLab extension is bundled with the Python package to provide launchbuttons in JupyterLab's Launcher panel for registered server processes.![](docs/source/_static/images/labextension-launcher.png)Clicking on them opens the proxied application in a new browser window.## Disable### Server extension```bashjupyter serverextension disable --sys-prefix jupyter_server_proxyjupyter server extension disable --sys-prefix jupyter_server_proxy```### Notebook classic extension```bashjupyter nbextension disable --sys-prefix --py jupyter_server_proxy```### JupyterLab extension```bashjupyter labextension disable @jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy```#### Local developmentTo setup a local development environment, see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).</longdescription>
