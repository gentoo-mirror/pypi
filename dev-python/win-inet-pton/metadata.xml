Credit Where Credit Is Due        --------------------------                This package is based on code that was originally written by https://github.com/nnemkin here: https://gist.github.com/nnemkin/4966028                Why?        ----                I needed this functionality in https://github.com/SerenitySoftwareLLC/cahoots to get full windows support. I figured, since there were other people looking for a solution to this on the net, I should publish it.                Usage        -----                 .. code-block:: bash                    python -m pip install win_inet_pton                Just import it, and it will auto-add the methods to the socket library:                 .. code-block:: python                    import win_inet_pton            import socket                    socket.inet_pton(...)            socket.inet_ntop(...)
