	<longdescription>Robot Framework===============.. contents::   :local:Introduction------------`Robot Framework &lt;http://robotframework.org&gt;`_ |r| is a generic open sourceautomation framework for acceptance testing, acceptance test drivendevelopment (ATDD), and robotic process automation (RPA). It has simple plaintext syntax and it can be extended easily with generic and custom libraries.Robot Framework is operating system and application independent. It isimplemented using `Python &lt;http://python.org&gt;`_ which is also the primarylanguage to extend it. The framework has a rich ecosystem around it consistingof various generic libraries and tools that are developed as separate projects.For more information about Robot Framework and the ecosystem, seehttp://robotframework.org.Robot Framework project is hosted on GitHub_ where you can find source code,an issue tracker, and some further documentation. Downloads are hosted on PyPI_.Robot Framework development is sponsored by non-profit `Robot Framework Foundation&lt;http://robotframework.org/foundation&gt;`_. If you are using the frameworkand benefiting from it, consider joining the foundation to help maintainingthe framework and developing it further... _GitHub: https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework.. _PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframework.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/robotframework.svg?label=version   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframework   :alt: Latest version.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/robotframework.svg   :target: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html   :alt: LicenseInstallation------------If you already have Python_ with `pip &lt;https://pip.pypa.io&gt;`_ installed,you can simply run::    pip install robotframeworkFor more detailed installation instructions, including installing Python, see`INSTALL.rst &lt;https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/INSTALL.rst&gt;`__.Robot Framework requires Python 3.6 or newer and runs also on `PyPy &lt;http://pypy.org&gt;`_.If you need to use Python 2, `Jython &lt;http://jython.org&gt;`_ or`IronPython &lt;http://ironpython.net&gt;`_, you can use `Robot Framework 4.1.3`__.__ https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/tree/v4.1.3#readmeExample-------Below is a simple example test case for testing login to some system.You can find more examples with links to related demo projects fromhttp://robotframework.org... code:: robotframework    *** Settings ***    Documentation     A test suite with a single test for valid login.    ...    ...               This test has a workflow that is created using keywords in    ...               the imported resource file.
