	<longdescription>Django Werkzeug===============[![Current version on PyPI](http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/django-werkzeug.svg)][pypi]Enhances Django `runserver` with [Werkzeug][].This project uses [Django Extensions][] under the hood. It &quot;wraps&quot; it, alongwith Werkzeug, so you don't have to add an explicit `werkzeug` dependencyto your `requirements.txt` or remember a new command.Why---Werkzeug and its builtin error page has proven to be indispensable in a numberof Django projects. While Django Extensions is also a great tool, the fullextent of it is not always needed in specific projects.Also, when committing to Werkzeug, it's convenient to run the `runserver`instead of learning a new command. This brings newcomers to your team up tospeed without further instruction and doesn't require existing members tochange their muscle memory during their day-to-day.If you want to use Werkzeug on certain projects, but don't want to keep trackof which ones, this package is for you.Requirements------------Django Werkzeug requires Django 1.8 or later.Installation------------```bash$ pip install django-werkzeug```Then enable it by adding it to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your `settings.py` file:```pythonINSTALLED_APPS = [    'django_werkzeug',    ...]```Usage-----```bash$ python manage.py runserver```Or to run Django's classic builtin server, run:```bash$ python manage.py runserver_classic```Contributing------------1.
