	<longdescription>[![CI](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/virl2-client/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/virl2-client/actions/workflows/main.yml)# VIRL 2 Client Library&gt; **Note:** The product has been renamed from *VIRL* to *Cisco Modeling Labs* /&gt; CML 2.  References to VIRL still exist in the product documentation and within&gt; code or examples.&gt;&gt; The name of the package itself has not been changed.  Throughout the&gt; documentation it is referred to as &quot;virl2_client&quot;,  &quot;Python Client Library&quot; or&gt; &quot;PCL&quot;.## IntroductionThis is the client library for the *Cisco Modeling Labs* Platform(`virl2_client`). It provides a Python package to programmatically create,edit, delete and control network simulations on a CML 2 controller.It is a pure Python implementation that requires Python 3. We've tested andwritten the package with Python 3.8.10.The status of the package can be considered **stable**.  Issues with thesoftware should be raised via the [GitHub issuetracker](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/virl2-client/issues).## Use Case DescriptionThe client library provides a convenient interface to control the life-cycle ofa network simulation. This can be used for automation scripts directly inPython but also for third party integrations / plugins which need to integratewith a simulated network. Examples already existing are an [Ansibleplugin](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ansible-virl).## InstallationThe package comes in form of a wheel that is downloadable from the CML2 controller. The package can be installed either from PyPI using    pip3 install virl2_clientIf you want to interact with devices via the client library, you need toalso install the pyATS library. This can be achieved in one go using```pip3 install &quot;virl2_client[pyats]&quot;```Note that this does *not* pull in the full pyATS package... See below how that is achieved.or, alternatively, the version that is bundled with the CML 2 controller canbe downloaded to the local filesystem and then directly installed via    pip3 install ./virl2_client-*.whlThe bundled version is available on the index site of the docs when vieweddirectly on the CML 2 controller.Ensure to replace and/or use the correct file name, replacing the wildcard with theproper version/build information. For example    pip3 install virl2_client-2.0.0b10-py3-none-any.whlWe recommend the use of a virtual environment for installation.If you require the full version of the pyATS library including things like Geniethen you need to do this in a subsequent step like shown here:    pip3 install &quot;pyats[full]&quot;&gt; **IMPORTANT**: The version of the Python client library  must be compatible&gt; with the version of the controller.  If you are running an older controller&gt; version then it's likely that the latest client library version from PyPI can&gt; **not** be used.  In this case, you need to either use the version available&gt; from the controller itself or by specifying a version constraint.&gt;&gt; Example: When on a controller version 2.2.x, then you'd need to install with&gt; `pip3 install &quot;virl2-client&lt;2.3.0&quot;`. This will ensure that the version&gt; installed is compatible with 2.2.x.## UsageThe package itself is fairly well documented using *docstrings*. In addition, thedocumentation is available in HTML format on the controller itself, via the&quot;Tools -&gt; Client Library&quot; menu.## CompatibilityThis package and the used API is specific to CML 2. It is notbackwards compatible with VIRL 1.x and therefore can not be used with VIRL1.x. If you are looking for a convenient tool to interface with the VIRL 1 APIthen the [CML Utils tool](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/virlutils) isrecommended.## Known IssuesThere are no major known issues at this point. See the comment in the *Introduction*section.  Also, see the *Issues* section in GitHub to learn about known issues or raise new ones, if needed.
