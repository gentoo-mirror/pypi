	<longdescription># Datadog library and command line tools[![Latest PyPI package version](https://badge.fury.io/py/libddog.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/libddog)[![libddog tests](https://github.com/nearmap/libddog/actions/workflows/github-actions.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/nearmap/libddog/actions/workflows/github-actions.yml)libddog lets you define your metrics and dashboards in code and get the full benefit of a programming language to automate your monitoring setup.First you write the query:```pythonquery = (Query(&quot;aws.elb.request_count&quot;)        .filter(region=&quot;us-east-1&quot;)        .agg(&quot;sum&quot;).by(&quot;availability-zone&quot;).as_count()        .rollup(&quot;sum&quot;, 5 * 60))# produces:#   sum:aws.elb.request_count{region:us-east-1}#    by {availability-zone}.as_count().rollup(sum, 300)```The query language closely resembles the Datadog syntax, but because it's Python code and not just a string it is validated and known to be well formed at definition time.Then you define what the graph looks like:```pythonTimeseries(    title=&quot;ELB: total requests by AZ every 5min&quot;,    requests=[        Request(            queries=[query],            display_type=DisplayType.BARS,        ),    ],    size=Size(height=3, width=5),)```This gives you the widget you want, with all the parameters supported by the Datadog UI.Learn more in the **[User guide](https://github.com/nearmap/libddog/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md)**.## The state of the projectlibddog is a young project and currently supports a small but useful subset of dashboard functionality. See the **[Feature support](https://github.com/nearmap/libddog/blob/master/docs/FEATURE_SUPPORT.md)** page for details.We plan to support more dashboard features over time. We also plan to support monitors.Want to know what's new in the project? Read the **[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/nearmap/libddog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)**.Want to contribute?
