	<longdescription>mappgene========[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/367142630.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/367142630)mappgene is a SARS-CoV-2 variant calling pipeline designed for high-performanceparallel computing. It mainly wraps iVar (https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar)and LoFreq (https://github.com/CSB5/lofreq) variant callers, plussnpEff/snpSift annotation tools.Inputs: short-read paired-end Illumina RTA3 sequencing data in fastq format(gzip compressed) (e.g., `SAMPLE_R1.fastq.gz SAMPLE_R2.fastq.gz`)Outputs: variants in `.vcf` variant call format files, and snpEff/snpSifttabular text output## Quick Start```bashsingularity pull library://khyox/mappgene/image.sif:latestgit clone https://github.com/LLNL/mappgene.gitpip install git+file:///absolute/path/to/mappgenemappgene --container image.sif --outputs outputs samples/*fastq.gz```## Requirements* Python 3.7+* [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/index.html)## InstallationWe recommend installing mappgene to a python3 virtualenv. We have foundit useful to install in &quot;editable&quot; mode to easily customize and modifymappgene.```bashpython3 -m venv mgsource mg/bin/activatepip install -e git+file:///absolute/path/to/mappgene```Don't forget to download the corresponding singularity container!It contains the pipeline components and dependencies.- iVar v1.3.2- LoFreq 2.1.5- See `mappgene/data/container/recipe.def` for more details```bashsingularity pull library://khyox/mappgene/image.sif:latest```Or go to &lt;https://cloud.sylabs.io/library/khyox/mappgene/image.sif&gt; and click&quot;Download&quot;.### Example TestingCheck that mappgene works on your system by running the example input data,sourced from[here](https://github.com/cbg-ethz/V-pipe/tree/master/tests/data/sars-cov-2/pos_MN908947_3_1/20200729/raw_data).```bashmappgene --test```## UsageSee `mappgene -h` for a list of options and detailed usage. In short:```mappgene [OPTIONS] &lt;SAMPLE1_R1.fastq.gz&gt; &lt;SAMPLE1_R2.fastq.gz&gt; [SAMPLEN_R1.fastq.gz ...]```Key options:- `--container`: tell mappgene where the singularity container is- `--slurm`: use the slurm scheduler for processing samples in parallel- `--use_full_node`: 1 sample per node- `--primers_bp`: specify a bundled primer set to use- `--depth_cap`: sets `lofreq call -d` value (read no more than this many reads per position)- `--read_cutoff_bp`: sets `ivar trim -m` value (remove reads smaller than this after trimming)- `--variant_frequency`: sets `ivar variants -t` value (do not call variants below this frequency)## Instructions### Process multiple samples in parallelYou can specify multiple samples with specific paths or Unix-style globbing.Reads must be gzip compressed (`.fastq.gz`).If there are two input filenames with a matching sample name, plus `_R1`and `_R2`, then mappgene will assume they are a deinterleaved pair. Fordeinterleaved reads, you must ensure:- first and second read files contain `_R1` and `_R2`, respectively- there is only one pair of read files per sample (no orphans, no multi-run  samples, samples from multi-sample subjects are treated separately)- read pairs appear together on the command line when expanding shell globs```mappgene &lt;SAMPLE1&gt;_R1.fastq.gz &lt;SAMPLE1&gt;_R2.fastq.gz [&lt;SAMPLE2&gt;_R1.fastq.gz &lt;SAMPLE2&gt;_R2.fastq.gz ...]```#### Interleaved samplesIf the input filenames do not contain `_R1` or `_R2`, mappgene will probablyinterpret the inputs as interleaved samples, and automatically deinterleavethem during processing.```mappgene &lt;SAMPLE1.FASTQ.GZ&gt; &lt;SAMPLE2.FASTQ.GZ&gt; &lt;SAMPLE3.FASTQ.GZ&gt;mappgene &lt;SAMPLE_DIR&gt;/*.fastq.gz```#### Slurm schedulingMultiple subjects can be run in parallel on HPC systems using the Slurm jobscheduler.```mappgene --slurm -n 1 -b mybank -p mypartition &lt;SAMPLE.FASTQ.GZ&gt;```### OutputBy default, results will be in `mappgene_outputs/&lt;SAMPLE&gt;`, orwherever specified by `--outputs`.Key output files:```bashmappgene_outputs/  &lt;SAMPLE&gt;/    worker.stdout  # (log file capturing stdout)    ivar_outputs/      &lt;SAMPLE&gt;.ivar.snpEff.vcf  # (ivar variant calls)      &lt;SAMPLE&gt;.ivar.snpSift.txt      &lt;SAMPLE&gt;.ivar.lofreq.snpEff.vcf  # (lofreq variant calls)      &lt;SAMPLE&gt;.ivar.lofreq.snpSift.txt```## Known bugs and quirks- The `--flux` option to use the Flux scheduler is broken.- Only `fastp` respects mappgene's `--threads` option. `bwa mem` and `lofreq`  use different numbers of threads. Additionally, if `--use_full_node` is not  specified, mappgene will try to run multiple samples per node.- `fastp`, `snpEff`, `snpSift` write to disk outside of the current working  directory—by default to the user's home—which may be on a different  filesystem not intended for parallel I/O.  This output is typically not used,  but it can still clobber or corrupt existing files, or impact cluster  performance for all users.- Viral-recon's `ivar_variants_to_vcf.py` attempts to group consecutive SNPs in  the same codon into single multinucleotide variants. Previous combinations of  `ivar` and viral-recon script versions have introduced runtime errors  (resolved by using patched `dev` branch versions).- Running multiple instances of mappgene in the same working directory is **not  recommended**, as a common temporary directory is used, resulting in scary  warnings, possible errors, and potentially corrupted runs.- `mappgene` assumes quality scores are RTA3 &quot;score category&quot; labels (error,  low, medium, high) for base calls rather than a continuous numeric score.  Although the quality score is supposed to reflect an average score for each  base call category, mappgene takes a conservative approach and adjusts medium  and high scores to the lower bound of those categories, i.e., Q37-&gt;Q30 and  Q25-&gt;Q20. This affects `lofreq`, a quality-aware variant caller, by making it  require more evidence (i.e., depth of read coverage) to call variants vs.  sequencing errors.License-------Mappgene is distributed under the terms of the BSD-3 License.LLNL-CODE-821512____You may be interested in[MappgeneSummary](https://github.com/LLNL/mappgenesummary), a package for theanalysis and summarization of mappgene's results.If you use mappgene in your research, please cite the paper.
