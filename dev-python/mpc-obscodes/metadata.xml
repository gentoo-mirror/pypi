It is an automatically generated mirror of the file so that it isinstallable via `pip`.Every night at around 2:15 AM UTC, the MPC observatory code file is downloaded and compared (via md5 checksum) to the current version of this package. If the checksums are different, a new package will be published.## InstallationThe latest version of the file can be install via pip:  `pip install mpc-obscodes`## Usage```pythonimport pandas as pdfrom mpc_obscodes import mpc_obscodesobscodes = pd.read_json(mpc_obscodes, orient=&quot;index&quot;)```## AcknowledgmentThis research has made use of data and/or services provided by the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center.See the Minor Planet Center's [website](https://cgi.minorplanetcenter.net/) for more details.</longdescription>
