It isespecially focussed on X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (XAFS)including X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and extendedX-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (EXAFS). It also supportsvisualization and analysis tools for X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectra andXRF and X-ray diffraction (XRD) images as collected at scanning X-raymicroprobe beamlines.Larch is written in Python, making heavy use of the excellent scientificpython libraries (`numpy`_, `scipy`_, `h5py`_, `matplotlib`_, and manymore). Larch can be used as a Python library for processing and analyzingX-ray spectroscopy and imaging data. In addition, the applications builtwith it also use a built-in Python-like macro language for interactive andbatch processing.  This embedded &quot;miniPython&quot; language is intended to be veryeasy to use for novices while also being complete enough to automate dataprocessing and analysis and to encourage and facilitate a gentle transitionto transition from GUI-only analyses to scripted and programmatic analysisof larger data sets, and allows Larch to be run as aservice, interacting with other processes or languages via XML-RPC, and sobe used by the popular `Demeter`_ XAFS application suite.Larch is distributed under an open-source license that is nearly identicalto the BSD license.  It is under active and open development centered atthe GeoScoilEnviroCARS sector of the Center for Advanced Radiation Sources atthe University of Chicago has been supported by the US National ScienceFoundation - Earth Sciences (EAR-1128799), and Department of EnergyGeoSciences (DE-FG02-94ER14466).  In addition, funding specifically forLarch was granted by the National Science Foundation - AdvancedCyberInfrastructure (ACI-1450468).The best citable reference for Larch is M.
