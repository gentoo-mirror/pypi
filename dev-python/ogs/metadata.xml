OGS is implemented in C++, itis object-oriented with an focus on the numerical solution of coupled multi-fieldproblems (multi-physics). Parallel versions of OGS are available relying onboth MPI and OpenMP concepts. Application areas of OGS are currently CO2sequestration, geothermal energy, water resources management, hydrology andwaste deposition. OGS is comprised of the THMC-simulator (simply referred to as*OGS*) and a visualization tool (*Data Explorer*). OGS is developed by the[OpenGeoSys Community][ogs].## Software development- Good starting point for users as well as for developers is the [documentation][documentation]- Check your code against our [styleguide](http://ufz.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.xml)- Have a look at the [source code documentation for the current master-branch build][docs-master] or [for the latest release][docs-release]## LicenseOpenGeoSys is distributed under the Modified BSD License.
