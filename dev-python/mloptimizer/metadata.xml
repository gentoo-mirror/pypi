	<longdescription>[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/mloptimizer/badge/?version=latest)](https://mloptimizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)# mloptimizer**mloptimizer** is a Python library for optimizing hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms using genetic algorithms. With mloptimizer, you can find the optimal set of hyperparameters for a given machine learning model and dataset, which can significantly improve the performance of the model. The library supports several popular machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting classifiers. The genetic algorithm used in mloptimizer provides an efficient and flexible approach to search for the optimal hyperparameters in a large search space.### InstallationIt is recommended to create a virtual environment using the `venv` package. To learn more about how to use `venv`, check out the official Python documentation at https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html.```bash# Create the virtual environmentpython -m venv myenv# Activate the virtual environmentsource myenv/bin/activate```To install `mloptimizer`, run:```bashpip install mloptimizer```### QuickstartHere's a simple example of how to optimize hyperparameters in a decision tree classifier using the iris dataset:```pythonfrom mloptimizer.genoptimizer import TreeOptimizerfrom sklearn.datasets import load_irisX, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)# The log file will be created in the current directory and will have info about optimizations performedopt = TreeOptimizer(X, y, &quot;output_log_file.log&quot;)clf = opt.optimize_clf(10, 10)```The las line of code will create a directory in the current folder with a name similar to `YYYYMMDD_nnnnnnnnnn_TreeOptimizer`.This folder contains a backup file for each generation and an `opt.log` inform with all the steps, the best estimator and the result of the optimization.## DependenciesThe following dependencies are used in `mloptimizer`:* [Deap](https://github.com/DEAP/deap) - Genetic Algorithms* [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) - Gradient boosting classifier* [Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) - Usado para generar RSS## DocumentationThe documentation for `mloptimizer` can be found in the project's [wiki](http://mloptimizer.readthedocs.io/)## Authors* **Antonio Caparrini** - *Owner* - [caparrini](https://github.com/caparrini)## LicenseThis project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).</longdescription>
