	<longdescription># code2gist 📦`code2gist` is a Python package that makes sharing your code projects easier than ever. With a simple command, it lets you upload your code files to GitHub's Gist. `code2gist` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/code2gist/).The package works hand-in-hand with OpenAI's ChatGPT-4's 'Browse with Bing' feature. Send codebases without going over the character limit using a secret URL. 🗜️Another key feature of `code2gist` is its ability to handle a wide range of text-based file types, not just Python files. 📄In addition, `code2gist` comes with a `prune` feature that provides a clean way to remove all the gists created by this tool from your GitHub account. 🌳## Installation ⚙️The recommended way to install `code2gist` is via `pipx`:```pipx install code2gist````pipx` ensures the package and its dependencies are isolated from your global Python environment. Moreover, `pipx` automatically adds the installed package to your PATH, so you can run `code2gist` from any directory in the command line. 🧠If you haven't installed `pipx` yet, you can do it by running `python3 -m pip install --user pipx` and then `python3 -m pipx ensurepath`.You can still install the package via pip, but you will have to add the package directory to your PATH manually 😒:```pip install code2gist```### Adding code2gist Directory to the PATH Environment Variable 👣Here are step-by-step instructions to add the code2gist directory to your PATH environment variable on Windows:1. Open the **Control Panel**.2. Navigate to **System and Security &gt; System**.3. Click on the **Advanced system settings** link on the left panel.4. Click **Environment Variables**.5. Under the **System Variables** section, find and double-click the variable **PATH**.6. Click **New**.7. Add the directory where code2gist is installed. For example, if you have Python 3.11 installed, the directory might look like this: `C:\...\Python311\Scripts`8. Click **OK** to close all windows and save the changes.After following these steps, your system should recognize code2gist commands from any directory in the command line. 👍### GitHub Token 🔑`code2gist` requires a GitHub token to function. You need to create a new token with the `gist` scope (which allows it to create gists). Follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to create a new token.Once you have your token, you should store it in the &quot;GITHUB_TOKEN&quot; environment variable. Here are the steps to set this variable in Windows:1. Open the Control Panel.2. Search for &quot;Environment Variables&quot;.3. Click on &quot;Edit the system environment variables&quot;.4. In the System Properties window that appears, click the &quot;Environment Variables...&quot; button.5. In the Environment Variables window, click the &quot;New...&quot; button under the &quot;User variables&quot; section.6. Enter &quot;GITHUB_TOKEN&quot; as the variable name and your token as the variable value.7. Click &quot;OK&quot; on all open windows to apply the changes.Please ensure that you have this variable set before using the package. ✅## Usage 🚀### Uploading Files 📤To use `code2gist`, simply use the following command:```code2gist .```This command will upload all Python files in the current directory to a private Gist on your GitHub account. The Gist will be titled with the name of the current directory, followed by &quot;[code2gist]&quot;.If you want to include files with different extensions, you can specify them using the `--ext` option:```code2gist . --ext .txt .md .py```This command will include all text, Markdown, and Python files in the upload.### Deleting Gists 🗑️The `prune` feature allows you to delete all gists created by `code2gist`:```code2gist --prune```Running this command will delete all your gists with &quot;[code2gist]&quot; in the description.## .gitignore and .code2gistignore Support ✅`code2gist` respects `.gitignore` and `.code2gistignore` rules. Files that match a rule in either file will be skipped. 🦘## Note 📝The gists created by `code2gist` are private by default, providing a safe way for you to share your code without making it publicly available.Please remember that `code2gist` is a tool for sharing code and should not be used to share sensitive information. Always ensure that your files do not contain any confidential data before uploading them.## License ⚖️`code2gist` is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).------We hope `code2gist` serves as a valuable tool in your development toolkit. Happy coding! 💻👨💻</longdescription>
