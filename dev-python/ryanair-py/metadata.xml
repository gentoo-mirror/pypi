	<longdescription># Ryanair PythonThis module allows you to retrieve either:1) The cheapest flights, with or without return flights, within a fixed set of dates.or2) All available flights between two locations, on a given dateThis is done directly through Ryanair's API, and does not require an API key.## Disclaimer&gt; __DISCLAIMER:__ This library is not affiliated, endorsed, or sponsored by Ryanair or any of its affiliates.  &gt; All trademarks related to Ryanair and its affiliates are owned by the relevant companies.  &gt; The author(s) of this library assume no responsibility for any consequences resulting from the use of this library.  &gt; The author(s) of this library also assume no liability for any damages, losses, or expenses that may arise from the use of this library.  &gt; Any use of this library is entirely at the user's own risk.  &gt; It is solely the user's responsibility to ensure compliance with Ryanair's terms of use and any applicable laws &gt; and regulations.  &gt; The library is an independent project aimed at providing a convenient way to interact with the Ryanair API, allowing&gt; individuals to find flights for personal use, and then ultimately purchase them via Ryanair's website.&gt; While the author(s) will make efforts to ensure the library's functionality, they do not guarantee the accuracy,&gt; completeness, or timeliness of the information provided.  &gt; The author(s) do not guarantee the availability or continuity of the library, and updates may not be guaranteed.  &gt; Support for this library may be provided at the author(s)'s discretion, but it is not guaranteed.  &gt; Users are encouraged to report any issues or feedback to the author(s) via appropriate channels.  &gt; By using this library, users acknowledge that they have read, understood, and agreed to the terms of this disclaimer.## InstallationRun the following command in the terminal:```pip install ryanair-py```## UsageTo create an instance:```pythonfrom ryanair import Ryanair# You can set a currency at the API instance level, so could also be GBP etc. also.# Note that this may not *always* be respected by the API, so always check the currency returned matches# your expectation. For example, the underlying API for get_all_flights does not support this.api = Ryanair(&quot;EUR&quot;)```### Get the cheapest one-way flightsGet the cheapest flights from a given origin airport (returns at most 1 flight to each destination).```pythonfrom datetime import datetime, timedeltafrom ryanair import Ryanairfrom ryanair.types import Flightapi = Ryanair(currency=&quot;EUR&quot;)  # Euro currency, so could also be GBP etc. alsotomorrow = datetime.today().date() + timedelta(days=1)flights = api.get_cheapest_flights(&quot;DUB&quot;, tomorrow, tomorrow + timedelta(days=1))# Returns a list of Flight namedtuplesflight: Flight = flights[0]print(flight)  # Flight(departureTime=datetime.datetime(2023, 3, 12, 17, 0), flightNumber='FR9717', price=31.99, currency='EUR' origin='DUB', originFull='Dublin, Ireland', destination='GOA', destinationFull='Genoa, Italy')print(flight.price)  # 9.78```### Get the cheapest return trips (outbound and inbound)```pythonfrom datetime import datetime, timedeltafrom ryanair import Ryanairapi = Ryanair(currency=&quot;EUR&quot;)  # Euro currency, so could also be GBP etc. alsotomorrow = datetime.today().date() + timedelta(days=1)tomorrow_1 = tomorrow + timedelta(days=1)trips = api.get_cheapest_return_flights(&quot;DUB&quot;, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow_1, tomorrow_1)print(trips[0])  # Trip(totalPrice=85.31, outbound=Flight(departureTime=datetime.datetime(2023, 3, 12, 7, 30), flightNumber='FR5437', price=49.84, currency='EUR', origin='DUB', originFull='Dublin, Ireland', destination='EMA', destinationFull='East Midlands, United Kingdom'), inbound=Flight(departureTime=datetime.datetime(2023, 3, 13, 7, 45), flightNumber='FR5438', price=35.47, origin='EMA', originFull='East Midlands, United Kingdom', destination='DUB', destinationFull='Dublin, Ireland'))```### Get all available flights between two airports&gt; ⚠️ __Warning:__ This API appears to be very tightly rate-limited.  &gt; Use it as infrequently as possible, with some backoff if possible.  &gt; Improper or over-usage could result in your IP address being blocked from using the API, &gt; __which is required to book flights__.E.g. get all available flights from Dublin to London Gatwick, or London, tomorrow:```pythonfrom datetime import datetime, timedeltafrom ryanair import Ryanairfrom tabulate import tabulate# We don't need to specify a currency if we're only using `get_all_flights`, as this API doesn't support currency # conversion. It will always return dares denominated in the currency of the departure country.  api = Ryanair()tomorrow = datetime.today().date() + timedelta(days=1)flights = api.get_all_flights(&quot;DUB&quot;, tomorrow, &quot;LGW&quot;)print(tabulate(flights, headers=&quot;keys&quot;, tablefmt=&quot;github&quot;))# We can even expand it to include all vaguely-London airports:flights = api.get_all_flights(&quot;DUB&quot;, tomorrow, &quot;LON&quot;, destination_is_mac=True)print(tabulate(flights, headers=&quot;keys&quot;, tablefmt=&quot;github&quot;))```This prints the following:| departureTime       | flightNumber   |   price | currency | origin   | originFull   | destination   | destinationFull   ||---------------------|----------------|---------|----------|----------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|| 2023-03-12 06:25:00 | FR 114         |   61.99 | EUR      | DUB      | Dublin       | LGW           | London (Gatwick)  || 2023-03-12 09:20:00 | FR 112         |   88.12 | EUR      | DUB      | Dublin       | LGW           | London (Gatwick)  || 2023-03-12 11:30:00 | FR 122         |  120.37 | EUR      | DUB      | Dublin       | LGW           | London (Gatwick)  || ...                 |                |         | EUR      |          |              |               |                   |and| departureTime       | flightNumber   |   price | currency | origin   | originFull   | destination   | destinationFull   ||---------------------|----------------|---------|----------|----------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|| 2023-03-12 06:25:00 | FR 114         |   61.99 | EUR      | DUB      | Dublin       | LGW           | LON               || 2023-03-12 06:35:00 | FR 202         |   65.09 | EUR      | DUB      | Dublin       | STN           | LON               || 2023-03-12 07:10:00 | FR 342         |   65.09 | EUR      | DUB      | Dublin       | LTN           | LON               || 2023-03-12 08:20:00 | FR 206         |  102.09 | EUR      | DUB      | Dublin       | STN           | LON               || ...                 |                |         |          |          |              |               |                   |</longdescription>
