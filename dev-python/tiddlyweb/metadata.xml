Earlier versions may work but are not explicitlytested.** Note that ``tiddlywebwiki`` and most plugins have not yet beenported to work with Python 3 but will work with 2.7. Work to bring them upto date is in progress.Introduction============TiddlyWeb is an open source HTTP API for storing and accessing flexibleand composable microcontent. It is also a toolkit for tiddlers on the web.Tiddlers are small chunks of optionally structured contentwith their own URI. The concept comes from `TiddlyWiki &lt;http://tiddlywiki.com&gt;`_.TiddlyWeb can provide the basis of a `server side for TiddlyWiki&lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tiddlywebwiki&gt;`_. TiddlyWeb provides:* an abstract model (with default implementations) for:  * authentication and authorization  * entity storage   * entity and collection serialization* a straightforward extension model via plugins* an implementation of authenticated recipes and bags allowing  access to dynamically created and filtered collections of tiddlers* a clean and pragmatic HTTP APIThe system is designed so that parts that are not optimal for aparticular installation can be easily improved or swapped out viaplugins.While TiddlyWeb was initially designed as a TiddlyWiki server-sideit can also be used as a generic data store and platform. The platformbuilds on concepts learned from TiddlyWiki, primarily the concept ofthe tiddler: a small chunk of data used to build up a greater whole.TiddlyWeb includes a command line tool called ``twanager``. Run ``twanager``without arguments for a list of available commands.Installation============The easiest way to install TiddlyWeb and all its dependencies is byusing `pip &lt;http://pip.openplans.org/&gt;`_ to install it from `PyPI&lt;http://pypi.python.org&gt;`_:::   pip install -U tiddlywebIf you wish to use TiddlyWeb as a server-side for TiddlyWiki to generatea multi-user TiddlyWiki system, you will also need `tiddlywebwiki&lt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tiddlywebwiki&gt;`_. This too can be installedvia pip. Installing tiddlywebwiki will install tiddlyweb for you:::   pip install -U tiddlywebwikiOr you can install by hand, you will need the following requirements:* Python 2.7 or Python 3.3. Earlier versions may work but are neither  tested nor recommended.* selector: http://lukearno.com/projects/selector/* simplejson: http://undefined.org/python/#simplejson* html5lib (for sanitizing input which may be rendered as HTML):  http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/* httpexceptor: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/httpexceptorBuilding=============Tests are run using PyTest:   make testCoverage support with:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coveragehttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-covMiscellaneous=============See http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&amp;term=tiddlywebpluginsfor plugins that TiddlyWeb can use with itself.If you have questions or contributions on making TiddlyWeb workfor you, please post to the TiddlyWeb group at google groups:  http://groups.google.com/group/tiddlywebor contact the primary author, Chris Dent &lt;cdent@peermore.com&gt;.Please report bugs and issues at the github issue tracker:  https://github.com/tiddlyweb/tiddlyweb/issuesThere are a few tools that make exploring TiddlyWeb a bit easier:* Python API explorer: ``twanager interact`` (once in type ``locals().keys()``)* HTTP API quick ref: http://docs.tiddlyweb.com/HTTP%20APILicense=======TiddlyWeb is released under the BSD License and is copyright2008-2016 UnaMesa Association.</longdescription>
