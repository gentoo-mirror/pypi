	<longdescription># django-sass-processor-dart-sassThis is a shim that makes [django-sass-processor](https://pypi.org/project/django-sass-processor/) use[Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) rather than [libsass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass) becauselibsass is deprecated.This provides a replacement for `sass.py` provided by libsass and simply calls out to `sass` provided by Dart Sass.Dart Sass must be [installed separately](https://sass-lang.com/install).## Note: vanilla Dart Sass onlyThis does not support the custom functions provided by django-sass-processor through libsass. It only supports vanillaDart Sass.## How to use itThis clashes with libsass, so remove libsass if you have it installed:```pip uninstall libsass```Install Dart Sass by following their [instructions](https://sass-lang.com/install).Install this package:```bashpip install https://github.com/laws-africa/django-sass-processor-dart-sass```That's it. Install and use `django-sass-processor` as normal.# Advanced usageIf you need to change the `sass` command, override it like so:```pythonfrom sass import dart_sassdart_sass.sass_command = ['/special/sass']# to use npm sass, use:dart_sass.sass_command = ['npx', 'sass']```# Build and releaseBuild: `python3 -m build`Release to Pypi: `python3 -m twine upload dist/*`</longdescription>
