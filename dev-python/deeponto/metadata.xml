The complete changelog is available at: [repository](https://github.com/KRR-Oxford/DeepOnto/blob/main/docs/changelog.md) or [website](https://krr-oxford.github.io/DeepOnto/changelog/).## About$\textsf{DeepOnto}$ aims to provide tools for implementing deep learning models, constructing resources, and conducting evaluationfor various ontology engineering purposes.- **Documentation**: *&lt;https://krr-oxford.github.io/DeepOnto/&gt;*.- **Github Repository**: *&lt;https://github.com/KRR-Oxford/DeepOnto&gt;*. - **PyPI**: *&lt;https://pypi.org/project/deeponto/&gt;*. ## Installation### OWLAPI$\textsf{DeepOnto}$ relies on [OWLAPI](http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/) version 4 (written in Java) for ontologies. We follow what has been implemented in [mOWL](https://mowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) that uses [JPype](https://jpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to bridge Python and Java Virtual Machine (JVM). !!! Warning    In the previous releases, the OWLAPI integration only worked on Mac OS and Linux.    The system restriction should be lifted now, please make a query if the incompatibility still exists.### Pytorch$\textsf{DeepOnto}$ relies on [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) for deep learning framework.Configure Pytorch installation with CUDA support using, for example:```bashpip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116```Basic usage of Ontology does not rely on GPUs, but for efficient deep learning model training, please make sure`torch.cuda.is_available()` returns `True`.### Install from PyPIOther dependencies are specified in `setup.cfg` and `requirements.txt` which are supposed to be installed along with `deeponto`.```bash# requiring Python&gt;=3.8pip install deeponto```### Use Git RepositoryOne can git clone the repository without installing through PyPI and install the dependencies manually by:```bashpip install -r requirements.txt```## Main Features&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img alt=&quot;deeponto&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KRR-Oxford/DeepOnto/main/docs/images/deeponto.svg&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; style=&quot;width: 90%;&quot;&gt;  &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Figure: Illustration of DeepOnto's architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;### Ontology ProcessingThe base class of $\textsf{DeepOnto}$ is [`Ontology`][deeponto.onto.Ontology], which serves as the main entry point for introducing the OWLAPI's features, such as accessing ontology entities, querying for ancestor/descendent (and parent/child) concepts, deleting entities, modifying axioms, and retrieving annotations. See quick usage at [load an ontology](https://krr-oxford.github.io/DeepOnto/ontology/). Along with these basic functionalities, several essential sub-modules are built to enhance the core module, including the following:- **Ontology Reasoning** ([`OntologyReasoner`][deeponto.onto.OntologyReasoner]): Each instance of $\textsf{DeepOnto}$ has a reasoner as its attribute. It is used for conducting reasoning activities, such as obtaining inferred subsumers and subsumees, as well as checking entailment and consistency. - **Ontology Pruning** ([`OntologyPruner`][deeponto.onto.OntologyPruner]): This sub-module aims to incorporate pruning algorithms for extracting a sub-ontology from an input ontology. We currently implement the one proposed in [2], which introduces subsumption axioms between the asserted (atomic or complex) parents and children of the class targeted for removal.- **Ontology Verbalisation** ([`OntologyVerbaliser`][deeponto.onto.OntologyVerbaliser]): The recursive concept verbaliser proposed in \cite{he2023ontolama} is implemented here, which can automatically transform a complex logical expression into a textual sentence based on entity names or labels available in the ontology. See [verbalising ontology concepts](https://krr-oxford.github.io/DeepOnto/verbaliser).- **Ontology Projection** ([`OntologyProjector`][deeponto.onto.OntologyProjector]): The projection algorithm adopted in the OWL2Vec* ontology embeddings is implemented here, which is to transform an ontology's TBox into a set of RDF triples. The relevant code is modified from the mOWL library.- **Ontology Normalisation** ([`OntologyNormaliser`][deeponto.onto.OntologyNormaliser]): The implemented $\mathcal{EL}$ normalisation is also modified from the mOWL library, which is used to transform TBox axioms into normalised forms to support, e.g., geometric ontology embeddings.### Tools and ResourcesIndividual tools and resources are implemented based on the core ontology processing module. Currently, $\textsf{DeepOnto}$ supports the following:- **BERTMap** [1] is a BERT-based *ontology matching* (OM) system originally developed in [repo](https://github.com/KRR-Oxford/BERTMap) but is now maintained in $\textsf{DeepOnto}$. See [ontology matching with BERTMap &amp; BERTMapLt](https://krr-oxford.github.io/DeepOnto/bertmap/).- **Bio-ML** [2] is an OM resource that has been used in the [Bio-ML track of the OAEI](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/projects/ConCur/oaei/). See [bio-ML specifications](https://krr-oxford.github.io/DeepOnto/bio-ml/).- **BERTSubs** [3] is a system for ontology subsumption prediction. We have transformed its original [experimental code](https://gitlab.com/chen00217/bert_subsumption) into this project. See [subsumption prediction with BERTSubs](https://krr-oxford.github.io/DeepOnto/bertsubs/).- **OntoLAMA** [4] is a set of language model probing datasets for ontology subsumption inference. See [OntoLAMA specifications](https://krr-oxford.github.io/DeepOnto/ontolama) for the use of the datasets and the prompt-based probing approach.## License!!! license &quot;License&quot;    Copyright 2021-2023 Yuan He.
