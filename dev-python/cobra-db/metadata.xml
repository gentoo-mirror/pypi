Allowing you to index, transform, and export your medical imaging metadata.With cobra_db, you will have more visibility of your data enabling you to get more value from your medical imaging studies.Once the metadata is in the database, you can import other text-based information (csv or json) into a custom collection and then run queries. This allows you to mix and match data extracted from different sources in different formats.For example, let's say you have 1 million mammography DICOM files and you would like to obtain the path of the files that belong to women scanned at an age of between 40 and 50 years old.If you had cobra_db, you could run the following query in just a few seconds directly in the mongo shell.```javascriptdb.ImageMetadata.find(  // filter the data  {patient_age:{$gt:40, $lte:50}},  // project it into a flat structure  {    patient_id: &quot;$dicom_tags.PatientID.Value&quot;    drive_name: &quot;$file_source.drive_name&quot;,    rel_path:&quot;$file_source.rel_path&quot;,  })```This would return the patient id, the drive name and the relative path (to the drive) for all the files that match the selection criteria.## InstallationIf you already have a working instance of the database, you only need to install the python package.```bash$ pip install cobra_db```If you would like to create a database from scratch, go ahead and follow the [tutorial](https://cobra-db.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html).## UsageIf you have an `ImageMetadata` instance id that you would like to access from python.```pythonfrom cobra_db import Connector, ImageMetadataDao# the _id of the ImageMetadata instance that you want to accessim_id = '62de8e38dc2414586e4ddb25'# prompt user for passwordconnector = Connector.get_pass(  host='my_host.server.com',  port=27017,  db_name='cobra_db',  username='my_user')# connect to the ImageMetadata collectionim_dao = ImageMetadataDao(connector)im = im_dao.get_by_id(im_id)print(im.date.file_source.rel_path)# this will return... rel/path/to/my_file.dcm```## ContributingInterested in contributing?
