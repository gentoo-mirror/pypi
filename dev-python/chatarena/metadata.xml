Then run the following command in the root directory of the repository:```shellgradio app.py```This will launch a demo server for ChatArena and you can access it in your browser.[//]: # (The interface looks like this:)[//]: # (![webui screenshot]&amp;#40;docs/images/webui.png&amp;#41;)Check out this video to learn how to use WebUI: [![Webui demo video](https://img.shields.io/badge/WebUI%20Demo%20Video-Vimeo-blue?logo=vimeo)](https://vimeo.com/816979419)## Basic Usage### Key Concepts- **Player**: a player is an agent that can interact with other players in a game environment. A player is defined by  its name, its backend, and its role description.    - **Backend**: a backend is a class that actually processes queries and generates responses in a conversation. A      backend can be a human, a remote or local LLM, or any program you create.- **Environment**: an environment is a class that defines the rules of a game and the game state transition.    - **Moderator**: a moderator is a special type of player that can control the game environment. It allows you to      define game environments using an LLM.- **Arena**: an arena is a utility class that contains the game environment and the players. It enables you to easily  run the game and save the game history, as well as interacting with the game via Web UI or CLI.### Step 1: Define Multiple Players with LLM Backend```pythonfrom chatarena.agent import Playerfrom chatarena.backends import OpenAIChat# Describe the environment (which is shared by all players)environment_description = &quot;It is in a university classroom ...&quot;# A &quot;Professor&quot; playerplayer1 = Player(name=&quot;Professor&quot;, backend=OpenAIChat(),                 role_desc=&quot;You are a professor in ...&quot;,                 global_prompt=environment_description)# A &quot;Student&quot; playerplayer2 = Player(name=&quot;Student&quot;, backend=OpenAIChat(),                 role_desc=&quot;You are a student who is interested in ...&quot;,                 global_prompt=environment_description)# A &quot;Teaching Assistant&quot; playerplayer3 = Player(name=&quot;Teaching assistant&quot;, backend=OpenAIChat(),                 role_desc=&quot;You are a teaching assistant of module ...&quot;,                 global_prompt=environment_description)```### Step 2: Create a Language Game EnvironmentYou can also create a language model-driven environment and add it to the ChatArena:```pythonfrom chatarena.environments.conversation import Conversationenv = Conversation(player_names=[p.name for p in [player1, player2, player3]])```### Step 3: Run the Language Game using ArenaArena is a utility class to help you run language games.```pythonfrom chatarena.arena import Arenaarena = Arena(players=[player1, player2, player3],              environment=env, global_prompt=environment_description)# Run the game for 10 stepsarena.run(num_steps=10)# Alternatively, you can run your own main loopfor _ in range(10):    arena.step()    # Your code goes here ...```You can easily save your game play history to file```pythonarena.save_history(path=...)```and save your game config to file```pythonarena.save_config(path=...)```### Other UtilitiesLoad Arena from config file (here we use `examples/nlp-classroom-3players.json` in this repository as an example)```pythonarena = Arena.from_config(&quot;examples/nlp-classroom-3players.json&quot;)arena.run(num_steps=10)```Run the game in an interactive CLI interface```pythonarena.launch_cli()```Check out this video to learn how to useCLI: [![cli demo video](https://img.shields.io/badge/CLI%20Demo%20Video-Vimeo-blue?logo=vimeo)](https://vimeo.com/816989884)## Advanced Usage### `ModeratedConversation`: a LLM-driven EnvironmentWe support a more advanced environment called `ModeratedConversation` that allows you to **control the game dynamicsusing an LLM**.The moderator is a special player that controls the game state transition and determines when the game ends.For example, you can define a moderator that track the board status of a board game, and end the game when a playerwins.You can try out our Tic-tac-toe and Rock-paper-scissors games to get a sense of how it works:```python# Tic-tac-toe exampleArena.from_config(&quot;examples/tic-tac-toe.json&quot;).launch_cli()# Rock-paper-scissors exampleArena.from_config(&quot;examples/rock-paper-scissors.json&quot;).launch_cli()```### Creating your Custom EnvironmentYou can define your own environment by extending the `Environment` class. Here are the general steps:1. Define the class by inheriting from a base class and setting `type_name`, then add the class   to [`ALL_ENVIRONMENTS`](chatarena/environments/__init__.py#L17)2. Initialize the class by defining `__init__` method (its arguments will define the corresponding config) and   initializing class attributes3. Implement game mechanics in methods `step`4. Handle game states and rewards by implementing methods such as `reset`, `get_observation`, `is_terminal`,   and `get_rewards`5. Develop role description prompts (and global prompt if necessary) for players using CLI or Web UI and save them to a   config file.We provide [a detailed tutorial](docs/tutorials/create_your_environment.md) to demonstrate how to define a customenvironment,using the [`Chameleon` environment](chatarena/environments/chameleon.py) as example.If you want to port an existing library's environment to ChatArena, checkout [`PettingzooChess` environment](chatarena/environments/pettingzoo_chess.py) as an example.## List of Games and Environments### [Conversation](chatarena/environments/conversation.py)A multi-player language game environment that simulates aconversation.* [NLP Classroom](examples/nlp-classroom-3players.json): a 3-player language game environment that simulates a  classroom  setting. The game is played in turns, and each turn a player can either ask a question or answer a question.  The game ends when all players have asked and answered all questions.### [Moderator Conversation](chatarena/environments/conversation.py)Based on converstion, but with a moderator that controls the game dynamics.* [Rock-paper-scissors](examples/rock-paper-scissors.json): a 2-player language game environment that simulates a  rock-paper-scissors game with moderator conversation.  Both player will act in parallel, and the game ends when one player wins 2 rounds.* [Tic-tac-toe](examples/tic-tac-toe.json): a 2-player language game environment that simulates a tic-tac-toe  game with moderator conversation.  The game is played in turns, and each turn a player can either ask for a move or make a move. The game ends when  one  player wins or the board is full.### [Chameleon](chatarena/environments/chameleon.py)A multi-player social deduction game. There are two roles in the game, chameleon and non-chameleon.The topic of the secret word will be first revealed to all the players.Then the secret word will be revealed to non-chameleons.The chameleon does not know the secret word.The objective in the game depends on the role of the player:- If you are not a chameleon, your goal is to reveal the chameleon without exposing the secret word.- If you are a chameleon, your aim is to blend in with other players, avoid being caught, and figure out the secret  word.  There are three stages in the game:1. The giving clues stage: each player will describe the clues about the secret word.2. The accusation stage: In this stage, each player will vote for another player who is most likely the chameleon. The   chameleon should vote for other players.3. The guess stage: If the accusation is correct, the chameleon should guess the secret word given the clues revealed by   other players.### [PettingZooChess](chatarena/environments/pettingzoo_chess.py)A two-player chess game environment that uses the PettingZoo Chess environment.## ContributingWe welcome contributions to improve and extend ChatArena.
