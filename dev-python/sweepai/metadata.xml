For harder problems, try to provide the same information a human would need. For simpler problems, providing a single line and a file name should suffice.A good issue might include:| Where to look &lt;br&gt; **[file name or function name]**| What to do &lt;br&gt; **[change the logic to do this]** | Additional Context (optional) &lt;br&gt; **[there's a bug/we need this feature/there's this dependency]** ||-----------|------------|----------------------||In `sweepai/app/ui.py`|use an os-agnostic temp directory|N/A||In `on_comment.py`|we should not fire an event|because it's possible that the comment is on a closed PR||In the config loader in `packages/server/src/config.ts`|add a third option called &quot;env&quot; to load the config settings from environment variables| At present, there are two options:  1. ... and 2. ...|If you want Sweep to use a file, try to mention the full path. Similarly, to have Sweep use a function, try to mention the class method or what it does. Also see [‚ú® Tips and tricks for Sweep](https://docs.sweep.dev/tricks).### üñ•Ô∏è Sweep ChatSweep Chat allows you to interact with Sweep and GitHub locally. Collaborate on the plan with Sweep, then have it create the pull request for you. **Prerequisites:** Install [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to your repository1. Run `pip3 install sweepai &amp;&amp; sweep`. Note that you need **python 3.10+.**    - Alternatively run `pip3 install --force-reinstall sweepai &amp;&amp; sweep` if the previous command fails.    - This runs GitHub authentication in your browser.2. Copy the üîµ blue 8-digit code from your terminal into the page. You should only need to do the authentication once.      - Wait a few seconds and Sweep Chat will start. 3. Choose a repository from the dropdown at the top (the Github app must be installed to this repository).    - ‚ö° Start chatting with Sweep Chat! ‚ö°&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/856ff66c2dbeaf39afbf6d8c49a620dfa70271fb/.assets/gradio-screenshot.png&quot;&gt;Tips:* üîç Relevant searched files will show up on the right. * üîò Sweep Chat creates PRs when the &quot;Create PR&quot; button is clicked. * üí° You can force dark mode by going to http://127.0.0.1:7861/?__theme=dark.#### From SourceIf you want the nightly build and or if the latest build has issues.1. `git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep &amp;&amp; poetry install`2. `python sweepai/app/cli.py`. Note that you need **python 3.10+**.### ‚ú® Sweep Github AppSetting up Sweep is as simple as adding the GitHub bot to a repo, then creating an issue for the bot to address.We support all languages GPT4 supports, including Python, Typescript, Rust, Go, Java, C# and C++.1. Add the [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to desired repos2. Create new issue in repo, like &quot;Sweep: Write tests&quot;3. Watch the magic happen ü™Ñ## ü§ù ContributingContributions are welcome and greatly appreciated! For detailed guidelines on how to contribute, please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.For more detailed docs, see [üöÄ Quickstart](https://docs.sweep.dev/start).## üìò StoryWe were frustrated by small tickets, like simple bug fixes, annoying refactors, and small features. Each task required us to open our IDE to fix simple bugs. So we decided to leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT to address this directly in GitHub.Unlike existing AI solutions, this can solve entire tickets and can be parallelized + asynchronous: developers can spin up 10 tickets and Sweep will address them all at once.## üìö The Stack- GPT-4 32k 0613 (default)- ActiveLoop DeepLake for Vector DB with MiniLM L12 as our embeddings model- Modal Labs for infra + deployment- Gradio for Sweep Chat## üó∫Ô∏è RoadmapSee [üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap](https://docs.sweep.dev/roadmap)## ‚≠ê Star History[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=sweepai/sweep&amp;type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#sweepai/sweep&amp;Date)Consider starring us if you're using Sweep so more people hear about us!&lt;h2 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;    Contributors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;    Thank you for your contribution!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;    &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/graphs/contributors&quot;&gt;      &lt;img src=&quot;https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=sweepai/sweep&quot; /&gt;    &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;    and, of course, Sweep!&lt;/p&gt;</longdescription>
