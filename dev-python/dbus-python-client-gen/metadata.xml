	<longdescription>A Python Library for Generating dbus-python Client Code=======================================================Function--------This library contains a function, make_class, that consumesan XML specification of a D-Bus interface. ::&gt;&gt;&gt; Klass = make_class(&quot;Klass&quot;, spec)This call yields a Python class, called Klass, with two static classmembers, &quot;Methods&quot; and &quot;Properties&quot;. The &quot;Methods&quot; class has a staticmethod corresponding to each method defined in the interface. Each methodtakes a proxy object as its first argument followed by any number ofkeyword arguments, corresponding to the arguments of the method. The&quot;Properties&quot; class has a static class corresponding to every propertydefined in the interface. Each property class may have a static Get() orSet() method, depending on its attributes.For example, assuming the interface defines a read only Version property,the following call should return a value. ::&gt;&gt;&gt; Klass.Properties.Version.Get()However, since Version is a read only property, the following call shouldfail with an AttributeError. ::&gt;&gt;&gt; Klass.Properties.Version.Set(&quot;42&quot;)Similarly, if the interface defines a method, Create, with one argument,name, a STRING, the following call should succeed. ::&gt;&gt;&gt; Klass.Methods.Create(proxy, name=&quot;name&quot;)The Create method invokes the method on the proxy object, passing force,transformed into a dbus-python String type.On the other hand, the invocation will raise a DPClientError exception ifthe method is called with an argument with an incorrect type as, ::&gt;&gt;&gt; Klass.Methods.Create(proxy, name=false)or with an incorrect keyword as, ::&gt;&gt;&gt; Klass.Methods.Create(proxy, force=false)or without all the necessary keywords as, ::&gt;&gt;&gt; Klass.Methods.Create(proxy)Errors------This library exports the exception type, DPClientError and all its subtypes.It constitutes a bug if an error of any other type is propagated during classgeneration or when the methods of the class are executed.The following shows the error hierarchy. Entries after the dash indicateadditional fields, beyond the message, which the exception contains. Onlyleaves of the error class heirarchy are constructed directly.DPClientError  * DPClientGenerationError    This exception is raised if an error occurs while generating the method.    Such an exception would result from introspection data which lacked the    necessary attributes or entries.  * DPClientRuntimeError - interface name    This exception is raised if there is an error while the generated method is    executing.    - DPClientInvalidArgError      This exception is raised if the arguments to be passed to the D-Bus      method are incorrect.        * DPClientKeywordError - method name, expected and actual keywords          This exception is raised if there are missing or unexpected arguments.        * DPClientMarshallingError - original arguments          This exception is raised if the arguments can not be transformed to          their required dbus-python types.    - DPClientInvocationError - invocation context      This exception is raised if a dbus-python method is invoked and some error      occurs. This exception's invocation context is used to distinguish between      a method call, a get property call, and a set property call. The context      is an object of type DPClientInvocationContext.The DPClientInvocationContext hierarchy is shown below. Entries after thedash indicate the fields in the context.DPClientInvocationContext  * DPClientMethodCallContext - method name, arguments  * DPClientGetPropertyContext - property name  * DPClientSetPropertyContext - property name, valueDependencies------------* dbus-python* into-dbus-pythonRequirements------------This library is not compatible with Python 2.</longdescription>
