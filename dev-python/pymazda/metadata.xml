	<longdescription># pymazdaThis is an API client for the MyMazda (Mazda Connected Services) API. This is the API used by the MyMazda mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mymazda/id451886367)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.interrait.mymazda)).Note: There is no official API, and this library may stop working at any time without warning.There is also a JavaScript version of this library called [node-mymazda](https://github.com/bdr99/node-mymazda).# WARNING - TLS FingerprintingAs of July 2022, it seems that Mazda has been utilizing a technique known as [TLS fingerprinting](https://stormwall.network/knowledge-base/termin/tls-fingerprinting) to attempt to block automated requests to their API. If you are getting consistent timeout errors when trying to use this library, then this is probably the reason. TLS fingerprinting works by analyzing patterns in the TLS handshake in order to determine whether the request is a legitimate request (such as from the MyMazda iOS/Android mobile app) or an automated request (such as from a Python library like this one). If the Mazda API believes that the request is likely to have originated from an automated system, they will block the request by letting it time out.Unfortunately, Python does not allow much control over the parameters of the TLS handshake, so it doesn't seem possible to change the requests to prevent them from being blocked. If anyone knows of a way to resolve this, please get in touch! In the meantime, here are a few possible workarounds: - Use [`node-mymazda`](https://github.com/bdr99/node-mymazda) (the Node.js version of this library) instead. Requests made from Node.js don't seem to be affected by the issue. - Try running your code in a different envrionment so that the parameters of the TLS handshake will be different. For example, use a different Python version or even a different OS version. Downgrading to Python 3.9 may work around the problem. - Run your code in a Docker container. For example, in my testing, containers built on the `python:3.10-alpine` base image seem to work.This situation is not ideal, but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be much we can do. Please try the workarounds above for now, and hopefully the situation will improve in the future.# InstallationTo install the latest release from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pymazda/), run `pip3 install pymazda`.# Quick StartThis example initializes the API client and gets a list of vehicles linked to the account. Then, for each vehicle, it gets and outputs the vehicle status and starts the engine.```pythonimport asyncioimport pymazdaasync def main() -&gt; None:    # Initialize API client (MNAO = North America)    client = pymazda.Client(&quot;myemail&quot;, &quot;mypassword&quot;, &quot;MNAO&quot;)    # Get list of vehicles from the API (returns a list)    vehicles = await client.get_vehicles()    # Loop through the registered vehicles    for vehicle in vehicles:        # Get vehicle ID (you will need this in order to perform any other actions with the vehicle)        vehicle_id = vehicle[&quot;id&quot;]        # Get and output vehicle status        status = await client.get_vehicle_status(vehicle_id)        print(status)        # Start engine        await client.start_engine(vehicle_id)    # Close the session    await client.close()if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    asyncio.run(main())```You will need the email address and password that you use to sign into the MyMazda mobile app. Before using this library, you will need to link your vehicle to your MyMazda account using the app. You will also need the region code for your region. See below for a list of region codes.When calling these methods, it may take some time for the vehicle to respond accordingly. This is dependent on the quality of the car's connection to the mobile network. It is best to avoid making too many API calls in a short time period of time, as this may result in rate limiting.# API Documentation## Initialize API Client```pythonclient = pymazda.Client(email, password, region, websession)```### Parameters| Parameter | Description || --------- | ----------- || `email`   | The email address you use to log into the MyMazda mobile app || `password` | The password you use to log into the MyMazda mobile app || `region` | The code for the region in which your account was registered&lt;br&gt;Supported regions include:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;North America (`MNAO`)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Europe (`MME`)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Japan (`MJO`)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; || `websession` | Optional. An instance of `aiohttp.ClientSession` to be used for the API requests. If omitted, the library will instantiate its own instance. || `use_cached_vehicle_list` | Optional. Set to `True` to enable caching for the `get_vehicles()` call. When `get_vehicles()` is called for the first time, the vehicle list will be fetched from the API and cached in memory. Subsequent calls will return the value from the cache. This may help to avoid rate limiting. |### Return valueReturns an instance of `pymazda.Client` which can be used to invoke the below methods.## Get List of Vehicles```pythonawait client.get_vehicles()```Gets a list of vehicles linked with the MyMazda account. **Only includes vehicles which are compatible with and enrolled in Mazda Connected Services.**### ParametersNone### Return value```jsonc[   {      &quot;vin&quot;: &quot;JMXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&quot;,      &quot;id&quot;: 12345,      &quot;nickname&quot;: &quot;My Mazda3&quot;,      &quot;carlineCode&quot;: &quot;M3S&quot;,      &quot;carlineName&quot;: &quot;MAZDA3 2.5 S SE AWD&quot;,      &quot;modelYear&quot;: &quot;2021&quot;,      &quot;modelCode&quot;: &quot;M3S  SE XA&quot;,      &quot;modelName&quot;: &quot;W/ SELECT PKG AWD SDN&quot;,      &quot;automaticTransmission&quot;: true,      &quot;interiorColorCode&quot;: &quot;BY3&quot;,      &quot;interiorColorName&quot;: &quot;BLACK&quot;,      &quot;exteriorColorCode&quot;: &quot;42M&quot;,      &quot;exteriorColorName&quot;: &quot;DEEP CRYSTAL BLUE MICA&quot;,      &quot;isElectric&quot;: false   },   {      // Other vehicles registered to your account   }]```## Get vehicle status```pythonawait client.get_vehicle_status(vehicle_id)```Get information about the current status of the vehicle.
