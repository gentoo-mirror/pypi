	<longdescription>Raspi-sump is a sump pit water level monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi and an Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04).![MobileScreenshot](https://www.linuxnorth.org/raspi-sump/images/rsump_mobile.jpg)Currently the system monitors the water level in your pit at defined intervals. It sendsemail sms alerts if the water reaches a critical level, indicating a possible sump pump failure.# What's NewSee the [changelog](https://github.com/alaudet/raspi-sump/blob/master/changelog) for the latest information on Raspi-Sump features.# Supported Versions of Raspbian / Raspberry Pi OSRaspi-Sump is currently supported on Raspberry Pi OS (Bullseye) and Raspian (Buster)# Discord GroupDiscuss and get support from other users. Email (alaudet@linuxnorth.org) for an invite link.# Install Dependencies    sudo apt install python3-pip python3-rpi.gpio python3-matplotlib# Install Raspi-SumpPip installs default to Wheels which omits some folder setup in setup.py.Always use the '--no-binary :all:' option when installing or upgrading Raspi-Sump with pip.    sudo pip3 install --no-binary :all: raspisump# Upgrading Raspi-Sump Upgrading an existing version    sudo pip3 install -U --no-binary :all: raspisumpThis will also install the [HCSR04sensor](https://github.com/alaudet/hcsr04sensor) Read the configuration docs copied during setup on your pi at the following location;    /home/username/raspi-sump/docsThey are also available on github https://github.com/alaudet/raspi-sump/blob/master/docs/install.md# Python2 (End of Life was January 1, 2020)Python2 installs of Raspi-Sump are no longer supported.# More InfoFurther details provided at https://www.linuxnorth.org/raspi-sump/An example hourly updating graph is available for view.https://www.linuxnorth.org/raspi-sump/raspi-sump-today.html# DisclaimerYou are welcome to use Raspi-Sump but there is no guarantee it will work. Your house may still flood if your sump pump fails. This software comes with no warranty. See License details.This is not a replacement for a properly maintained water pumping system. It is one tool you can use to give yourself extra piece-of-mind.Best practices should include:* A backup pump that triggers at a slightly higher water level than your main pump.* The secondary pump should be connected to a seperate dedicated electrical breaker. * You should also have a generator that can provide power should you have an extended outage during the spring or other unseasonally wet time of year.* if you are building a new home, pay attention to the grade of your property, as you may be able to let gravity empty your pit for you.  That would be the best approach with a backup pump for added protection.Once you have done all of these things, then consider using a monitoring system like Raspi-Sump.# LicenseMIT License.
