	<longdescription>===============================Boto3 - The AWS SDK for Python===============================|Version| |Python| |License|Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) forPython, which allows Python developers to write software that makes useof services like Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2. You can find the latest, mostup to date, documentation at our `doc site`_, including a list ofservices that are supported.Boto3 is maintained and published by `Amazon Web Services`_.Boto (pronounced boh-toh) was named after the fresh water dolphin native to the Amazon river. The name was chosen by the author of the original Boto library, Mitch Garnaat, as a reference to the company.Notices-------On 2023-12-13, support for Python 3.7 will end for Boto3. This follows thePython Software Foundation `end of support &lt;https://peps.python.org/pep-0537/#lifespan&gt;`__for the runtime which occurred on 2023-06-27.For more information, see this `blog post &lt;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/python-support-policy-updates-for-aws-sdks-and-tools/&gt;`__... _boto: https://docs.pythonboto.org/.. _`doc site`: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html.. _`Amazon Web Services`: https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/.. |Python| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/boto3.svg?style=flat    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/boto3/    :alt: Python Versions.. |Version| image:: http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/boto3.svg?style=flat    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/boto3/    :alt: Package Version.. |License| image:: http://img.shields.io/pypi/l/boto3.svg?style=flat    :target: https://github.com/boto/boto3/blob/develop/LICENSE    :alt: LicenseGetting Started---------------Assuming that you have a supported version of Python installed, you can firstset up your environment with:.. code-block:: sh    $ python -m venv .venv    ...    $ . .venv/bin/activateThen, you can install boto3 from PyPI with:.. code-block:: sh    $ python -m pip install boto3or install from source with:.. code-block:: sh    $ git clone https://github.com/boto/boto3.git    $ cd boto3    $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt    $ python -m pip install -e .Using Boto3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~After installing boto3Next, set up credentials (in e.g. ``~/.aws/credentials``):.. code-block:: ini    [default]    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_KEY    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRETThen, set up a default region (in e.g. ``~/.aws/config``):.. code-block:: ini   [default]   region=us-east-1Other credential configuration methods can be found `here &lt;https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html&gt;`__Then, from a Python interpreter:.. code-block:: python    &gt;&gt;&gt; import boto3    &gt;&gt;&gt; s3 = boto3.resource('s3')    &gt;&gt;&gt; for bucket in s3.buckets.all():            print(bucket.name)Running Tests~~~~~~~~~~~~~You can run tests in all supported Python versions using ``tox``. By default,it will run all of the unit and functional tests, but you can also specify your own``pytest`` options. Note that this requires that you have all supportedversions of Python installed, otherwise you must pass ``-e`` or run the``pytest`` command directly:.. code-block:: sh    $ tox    $ tox -- unit/test_session.py    $ tox -e py26,py33 -- integration/You can also run individual tests with your default Python version:.. code-block:: sh    $ pytest tests/unitGetting Help------------We use GitHub issues for tracking bugs and feature requests and have limitedbandwidth to address them.
