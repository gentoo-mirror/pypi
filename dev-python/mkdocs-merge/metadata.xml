	<longdescription># MkDocs MergeThis simple tool allows you to merge the source of multiple [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) sitesinto a single one converting each of the specified sites to a sub-site of the master site.Supports unification of sites with the same `site_name` into a single sub-site.## ChangelogAccess the changelog here: https://ovasquez.github.io/mkdocs-merge/changelog/&gt; Note: Since version 0.6 MkDocs Merge added support for MkDocs 1.0 and dropped&gt; support for earlier versions.&gt; See here for more details about the changes in [MkDocs 1.0](https://www.mkdocs.org/about/release-notes/#version-10-2018-08-03).---[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mkdocs-merge.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mkdocs-merge)[![MkDocs Merge Validation Build](https://github.com/ovasquez/mkdocs-merge/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ovasquez/mkdocs-merge/actions/workflows/build.yml)MkDocs-Merge officially supports Python versions 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10. It has been tested to work correctly in previous 3.X versions, but those are no longer officially supported.## Install```bash$ pip install mkdocs-merge```## Usage```bash$ mkdocs-merge run MASTER_SITE SITES [-u]...```### Parameters- `MASTER_SITE`: the path to the MkDocs site where the base `mkdocs.yml` file resides. This is where all other sites    will be merged into.- `SITES`: the paths to each of the MkDocs sites that will be merged. Each of these paths is expected to have a    `mkdocs.yml` file and a `docs` folder.- `-u` (optional): Unify sites with the same &quot;site_name&quot; into a single sub-site.  ### Example```bash$ mkdocs-merge run root/mypath/mysite /another/path/new-site /newpath/website```A single MkDocs site will be created in `root/mypath/mysite`, and the sites in`/another/path/new-site` and `/newpath/website` will be added as sub-pages.**Original `root/mypath/mysite/mkdocs.yml`**```yaml...nav:  - Home: index.md  - About: about.md```**Merged `root/mypath/mysite/mkdocs.yml`**```yaml...nav:  - Home: index.md  - About: about.md  - new-site: new-site/home/another.md # Page merged from /another/path/new-site  - website: website/index.md # Page merged from /newpath/website```## Development### Dev InstallClone the repository and specify the `dev` dependencies on the install command.Check this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28842733/2313246) for more details about the `dev`dependencies```bash$ pip install -e .[dev]```### TestThe tests can be run using `tox` from the root directory. `tox` is part of the development dependencies:```bash$ tox```## Project StatusVery basic implementation. The code works but doesn't allow to specify options for the merging.### Pending work- [ ] Refactoring of large functions.- [x] GitHub Actions build.- [x] Publish pip package.- [ ] Better error handling.- [x] Merge configuration via CLI options.- [x] Unit testing (work in progress).- [ ] CLI integration testing.- [ ] Consider more complex cases.- [x] Make MkDocs Merge module friendly: thanks to [mihaipopescu](https://github.com/mihaipopescu)</longdescription>
