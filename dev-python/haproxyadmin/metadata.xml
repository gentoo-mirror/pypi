README.rst============haproxyadmin============    *A Python library to manage HAProxy via stats socket.*.. contents::Introduction------------**haproxyadmin** is a Python library for interacting with `HAProxy`_load balancer to perform operations such as enabling/disabling servers.It does that by issuing the appropriate commands over the `stats socket`_provided by HAProxy. It also uses that stats socket for retrievingstatistics and changing settings.HAProxy is a multi-process daemon and each process can only be accessed by adistinct stats socket. There isn't any shared memory for all these processes.That means that if a frontend or backend is managed by more than one processes,you have to find which stats socket you need to send the query/command.This makes the life of a sysadmin a bit difficult as he has to keep track ofwhich stats socket to use for a given object(frontend/backend/server).**haproxyadmin** resolves this problem by presenting objects as single entitieseven when they are managed by multiple processes. It also supports aggregationfor various statistics provided by HAProxy. For instance, to report therequests processed by a frontend it queries all processes which manage thatfrontend and return the sum.The library works with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6, but for development andtesting Python 3.6 is used. The `Six Python 2 and 3 Compatibility Library`_is being used to provide the necessary wrapping over the differences betweenthese 2 major versions of Python... code-block:: python    &gt;&gt;&gt; from haproxyadmin import haproxy    &gt;&gt;&gt; hap = haproxy.HAProxy(socket_dir='/run/haproxy')    &gt;&gt;&gt; frontends = hap.frontends()    &gt;&gt;&gt; for frontend in frontends:    ...     print(frontend.name, frontend.requests, frontend.process_nb)    ...    frontend_proc2 0 [2]    haproxy 0 [4, 3, 2, 1]    frontend_proc1 0 [1]    frontend1_proc34 0 [4, 3]    frontend2_proc34 0 [4, 3]    &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt;    &gt;&gt;&gt; backends = hap.backends()    &gt;&gt;&gt; for backend in backends:    ...    print(backend.name, backend.requests, backend.process_nb)    ...    servers = backend.servers()    ...    for server in servers:    ...       print(&quot; &quot;, server.name, server.requests)    ...    backend_proc2 100 [2]      bck_proc2_srv4_proc2 25      bck_proc2_srv3_proc2 25      bck_proc2_srv1_proc2 25      bck_proc2_srv2_proc2 25    haproxy 0 [4, 3, 2, 1]    backend1_proc34 16 [4, 3]      bck1_proc34_srv1 6      bck_all_srv1 5      bck1_proc34_srv2 5    backend_proc1 29 [1]      member2_proc1 14      member1_proc1 15      bck_all_srv1 0    backend2_proc34 100 [4, 3]      bck2_proc34_srv2 97      bck2_proc34_srv1 2      bck_all_srv1 1    &gt;&gt;&gt;The documentation of the library is available at http://haproxyadmin.readthedocs.orgFeatures--------- HAProxy in multi-process mode (nbproc &gt;1)- UNIX stats socket, no support for querying HTTP statistics page- Frontend operations- Backend operations- Server operations- ACL operations- MAP operations- Aggregation on various statistics- Change global options for HAProxyInstallation------------Use pip::    pip install haproxyadminFrom Source::   sudo python setup.py installBuild (source) RPMs::   python setup.py clean --all; python setup.py bdist_rpmBuild a source archive for manual installation::   python setup.py sdistRelease-------#. Bump versions in docs/source/conf.py and haproxyadmin/__init__.py#. Commit above change with::      git commit -av -m'RELEASE 0.1.3 version'#. Create a signed tag, pbr will use this for the version number::      git tag -s 0.1.3 -m 'bump release'#. Create the source distribution archive (the archive will be placed in the **dist** directory)::      python setup.py sdist#. pbr will update ChangeLog file and we want to squeeze them to the previous commit thus we run::      git commit -av --amend#. Move current tag to the last commit::      git tag -fs 0.1.3 -m 'bump release'#. Push changes::      git push;git push --tagsDevelopment-----------I would love to hear what other people think about **haproxyadmin** and providefeedback.
