A *Resolver* can then transform that Feedback intosomething that an *Environment* can hand off to a learner (or other interestedparty). These Feedback Functions are organized into *Tools*... image:: docsrc/_static/pedal-overview-v3.pngOne of our major goals is to attach metadata to feedback to enable easieranalysis, versioning, and evaluation. Although Instructor Control Scripts canbe written very imperatively to specify very complex (or simple) grading logic,we are trying to reach an elegant, declarative style. This will enable toolingto automatically generate reports on occurrences of feedback, connect todatasets like those in the ProgSnap format, and allow us to &quot;unit test ourunit tests&quot;.One of our other goals for this project is to categorize Feedbacks' Conditionsand Responses, using concepts established by Narciss 2006. For example, wesay some Kinds of Responses are &quot;hints&quot; instead of &quot;mistakes&quot;. We also saythat Conditions can be Categorized as being from &quot;Specifications&quot; or&quot;Runtime&quot;.For more information, check out the docs for Pedal_... _Pedal: https://pedal-edu.github.io/pedal</longdescription>
