	<longdescription># nlpip - A natural language based unix pipeline utility`nlpip` takes a text written in natural language as input, and performs aspecified command also written in natural language, and then outputs the resultin natural language.Here's a demo:&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/akngs/nlpip/raw/main/nlpip.svg&quot; alt=&quot;screen recording&quot;&gt;## InstallationFirst, you need to install `nlpip` using `pip`:    pip install nlpipThen, set your OpenAI's API key as an environment variable:    export OPENAI_API_KEY=WRITE_YOUR_KEY_HERE## How to use`nlpip` or just `nlp` for short, provides following default commands:- `keywords`: Extract keywords from input text- `poem`: Write poem using input text- `summarize`: Summarize input text- `sentiment`: Analyze sentiment of input textFor example, if you want summarize `input.txt` and turn it into a poem, you canrun the following command:    cat input.txt | nlp summarize | nlp poem## How to create a new commandTo create a new command, you just need to create a text file containing thecommand in natural language. For example, if you want to create a command thattranslates input text into French, you can create a file named`~/.nlpip/prompts/fr.txt` in with:    Translate into FrenchThen, you can run the following command:    echo Hello | nlp frAnd you will get the following output:    BonjourYou may override default commands by creating a file with the same name in`~/.nlpip/prompts/`.## Credit- `nlpip` is inspired by  [Schillace Laws of Semantic AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/howto/schillacelaws).</longdescription>
