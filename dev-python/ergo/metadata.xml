	<longdescription># ERGO## Simple Microservice Development FrameworkErgo is the substrate for the rapid development of coordinated microservices.The primary emphasis with Ergo is to eliminate - as much as possible - the boilerplate infrastructure that is common to most software stacks to facilitate a larger developer emphasis on business-oriented development.  This is achieved with inversion of control and procedural injection.For example; Consider the following python function in a file `math.py`:```# math.pydef product(x, y):    return float(x) * float(y)```Ergo provides the tooling to bootstrap this simple function into any one of a variety of environments (eg. console application, http service, MQ worker, etc.)To start an http service for the above function:```$ ergo http math.py:product```then to make a request against this service```$ curl -i &quot;http://localhost?x=4&amp;y=5&quot;20.0```</longdescription>
