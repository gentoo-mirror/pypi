Currently, Jupyter Server only has minor and patch versions. Different minor versions likely include API-changes while patch versions do not change API.When a new minor version is released on PyPI, a branch for that version will be created in this repository, and the version of the main branch will be bumped to the next minor version number. That way, the main branch always reflects the latest un-released version.To see the changes between releases, checkout the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).## Usage - Running Jupyter Server### Running in a local installationLaunch with:```jupyter server```### TestingSee [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#running-tests).## ContributingIf you are interested in contributing to the project, see [`CONTRIBUTING.rst`](CONTRIBUTING.rst).## Team Meetings and Roadmap- When: Thursdays [8:00am, Pacific time](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=8%3A00%20am&amp;tz=San%20Francisco&amp;)- Where: [Jovyan Zoom](https://zoom.us/my/jovyan?pwd=c0JZTHlNdS9Sek9vdzR3aTJ4SzFTQT09)- What: [Meeting notes](https://github.com/jupyter-server/team-compass/issues/4)See our tentative [roadmap here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/issues/127).## About the Jupyter Development TeamThe Jupyter Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Jupyter project.This includes all of the Jupyter subprojects.The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:https://github.com/jupyter/.## Our Copyright PolicyJupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyrightover their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that thesecontributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupytersource code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person orinstitution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire JupyterDevelopment Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of whatchanges/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicatetheir copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit thechange to one of the Jupyter repositories.With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code fileto indicate the copyright and license terms:```# Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team.# Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.```</longdescription>
