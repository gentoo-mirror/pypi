	<longdescription>GitHub-Flavored Markdown for Python===================================**PLEASE READ BEFORE USING:****This repository will not receive bug fixes, and might become read-only soon.**Rationale: this library has well-known `consistency issues`_ with GitHub-Flavored Markdown rendering. Fixingthem would require time investment the maintainer cannot provide. The maintainer is also fatigued byMarkdown's library constantly breaking their internal API with each minor release.**Consider instead using** |pycmarkgfm|_ (PyPi_), a lightweight Python 3.5+ wrapper for GitHub's own implementation of GFM from the same author,which is faster, virtually byte-compatible with GitHub rendering,and provides a nice API for managing task lists aka.

It aims for, but does notachieve, maximal compatibility with GitHub's rendering.Tested Python versions are 3.5 to 3.8. Sorry, no Python 2.7 support startingwith py-gfm 1.x since the Python Markdown library itself is Python 3 only.Documentation-------------You can browse or download the precompiled documentationon `Read the Docs`_.To build the Sphinx documentation from source, use::   cd doc &amp;&amp; make htmlSupported features-------------------  Fenced code blocks-  Literal line breaks-  Tables-  Hyperlink parsing (``http``, ``https``, ``ftp``, ``email`` and   ``www`` subdomains)-  Code highlighting for code blocks if Pygments is available-  Mixed-style lists with no separation-  Strikethrough-  Task listsUnsupported features and known differences------------------------------------------py-gfm is a pure Python implementation based on the Python Markdown library andtherefore cannot reproduce GitHub's `own implementation`_ with 100% accuracy.See `the docs`_ for a list of known discrepancies.License-------BSD-style.
