The frame format bindings are the recommended ones to use, asthis guarantees interoperability with other implementations and languagebindings.Experimental bindings for the the `streaming format&lt;https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/master/examples/streaming_api_basics.md&gt;`_specification are also included, but further work on those is required.The API provided by the frame format bindings follows that of the LZMA, zlib,gzip and bzip2 compression libraries which are provided with the Python standardlibrary. As such, these LZ4 bindings should provide a drop-in alternative to thecompression libraries shipped with Python. The package provides context managersand file handler support.The bindings drop the GIL when calling in to the underlying LZ4 library, and isthread safe. An extensive test suite is included.Documentation=============.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/python-lz4/badge/?version=stable   :target: https://readthedocs.org/projects/python-lz4/   :alt: DocumentationFull documentation is included with the project.
