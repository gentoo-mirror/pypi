Dramatic improvements in high-throughput sequencing technologies now enable large-scale characterization of Ig repertoires, defined as the collection oftrans-membrane antigen-receptor proteins located on the surface of B cells andT cells. Change-O is a suite of utilities to facilitate advanced analysis ofIg and TCR sequences following germline segment assignment. Change-Ohandles output from IMGT/HighV-QUEST and IgBLAST, and provides a wide variety ofclustering methods for assigning clonal groups to Ig sequences. Record sorting, grouping, and various database manipulation operations are also included.</longdescription>
