It is backwards compatibility withBazaar's disk format and protocols. One of the key differences withBazaar is that Breezy runs on Python 3, rather than on Python 2.Breezy highlights=================Breezy directly supports both central version control (like cvs/svn) anddistributed version control (like git/hg). Developers can organize theirworkspace in whichever way they want on a per project basis including:* checkouts (like svn)* feature branches (like hg)* shared working tree (like git).It also directly supports and encourages a large number of development bestpractices like refactoring and pre-commit regression testing.
