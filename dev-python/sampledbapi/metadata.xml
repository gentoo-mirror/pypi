	<longdescription># SampleDB API Wrapper## What it doesThis package is a simple Python wrapper for the [HTTP API](https://scientific-it-systems.iffgit.fz-juelich.de/SampleDB/developer_guide/api.html) of [SampleDB](https://scientific-it-systems.iffgit.fz-juelich.de/SampleDB/), a web-based sample and measurement metadata database developed at PGI and JCNS.This Python wrapper may also be used e.g. in Matlab and Julia.## InstallationUser installation using pip:```pip install --upgrade --user sampledbapi```System installation using pip:```pip install --upgrade sampledbapi```## Example usage### Python```pythonfrom sampledbapi import *server_address = ...api_key = ...# Authenticationauthenticate(server_address, api_key)# Simple queriesprint(actions.get_list())print(objects.get(123))print(instruments.get_list())# Advanced searchprint(objects.get_list(&quot;material == \&quot;Sb\&quot;&quot;))```More examples for usage in Python can be found [here](https://ag-salinga.zivgitlabpages.uni-muenster.de/sampledb-api-wrapper/Examples.html).### MatlabYou need a working installation of Python and `sampledbapi` installed for this to work.Some type conversions are needed (e.g. to pass integers).```matlab% Authenticationpy.sampledbapi.authenticate(&quot;https://...&quot;, &quot;your_api_key&quot;)% Simple queriesprint(instruments.get_list())py.sampledbapi.objects.get(py.int(123))py.sampledbapi.instruments.get_list())% Advanced searchl = py.sampledbapi.objects.get_list('material == &quot;Sb&quot;')obj = l{1}obj.data```In an analogous way, the Python examples shown [here](https://ag-salinga.zivgitlabpages.uni-muenster.de/sampledb-api-wrapper/Examples.html) can be used in Matlab.## DocumentationThe current API documentation can be found [here](https://ag-salinga.zivgitlabpages.uni-muenster.de/sampledb-api-wrapper).Further details on the input and output of each function (usually JSON) can be found in the documentation of the [HTTP API](https://scientific-it-systems.iffgit.fz-juelich.de/SampleDB/developer_guide/api.html).## What worksThe full HTTP API of SampleDB is supported.
