However the underlying class base has been changedto a vanilla python slots based system - the thinking behind this is in theAPI internals documentation. This will change the underlying requirements.Additionally at the same time I have converted to Broadworks R24 API schemafiles as the basis for generating these classes. This will change the set ofavailable commands and classes.## CreditsThe class used to be built using Michael DeHaan's [`ClassForge`](https://classforge.io/) object system, however from version 2.0.0 it hasbeen based on vanilla python slotted objects.Development on the python version was done by[Nigel Metheringham `&lt;nigelm@cpan.org&gt;`](https://github.com/nigelm/)Karol Skibi≈Ñski has been using the package, and has a talent for both findingbugs within it and providing a good bug report that allows a test case and fixto be made. The package has been immensely improved by this work.---</longdescription>
