	<longdescription>desktop3========.. image:: https://travis-ci.com/eight04/pyDesktop3.svg?branch=master    :target: https://travis-ci.com/eight04/pyDesktop3This is a python 3 port of `desktop &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/desktop&gt;`__ package.    The desktop package provides desktop environment detection and resource    opening support for a selection of common and standardised desktop    environments.Insallation-----------::    pip install desktop3Usage-----Launch folders, files, ... etc:.. code:: python    import desktop    desktop.open(&quot;what/you/want/to/open&quot;)Introduction------------The desktop package provides desktop environment detection and resourceopening support for a selection of common and standardised desktopenvironments.Currently, in Python's standard library, there is apparently no coherent,cross-platform way of getting the user's environment to &quot;open&quot; files orresources (showing such files in browsers or editors, for example) whenrequested by a Python program. There is an os.startfile function which worksfor Windows, but no equivalent function for other desktop environments - thewebbrowser module seems to employ alternative mechanisms in choosing andrunning external programs and presumably does not seek to provide generalsupport for non-URL resources anyway.  Since desktop environments like KDE and GNOME provide mechanisms for runningbrowsers and editors according to the identified type of a file or resource,just as Windows &quot;runs&quot; files or resources, it is appropriate to have a modulewhich accesses these mechanisms. It is this kind of functionality that thedesktop package aims to support. Note that this approach is arguably betterthan that employed by the webbrowser module since most desktop environmentsalready provide mechanisms for configuring and choosing the user's preferredprograms for various activities, whereas the webbrowser module makesrelatively uninformed guesses (for example, opening Firefox on a KDE desktopconfigured to use Konqueror as the default browser).Some ideas for desktop detection (XFCE) and URL opening (XFCE, X11) wereobtained from the xdg-utils project which seeks to implement programsperforming similar functions to those found in the desktop module. Thexdg-utils project can be found here:http://portland.freedesktop.org/Other information regarding desktop icons and menus, screensavers and MIMEconfiguration can also be found in xdg-utils.Contact, Copyright and Licence Information------------------------------------------No Web page has yet been made available for this work, but the author can becontacted at the following e-mail address:paul@boddie.org.ukCopyright and licence information can be found in the docs directory - seedocs/COPYING.txt, docs/lgpl-3.0.txt and docs/gpl-3.0.txt for more information.Notes-----Notes on desktop application/environment support:============= ================================================================KDE           Supports file and URL opening using kfmclient, where the openURL              command opens the resource and the exec command runs the              resource.KDE 4         Similar to KDE but uses kioclient instead of kfmclient.GNOME         Supports file and URL opening using gnome-open.XFCE          Supports file and URL opening using exo-open.ROX-Filer     Supports file opening using &quot;rox &lt;filename&gt;&quot; but not URL              opening.============= ================================================================Changelog---------* 0.5.3 (Aug 19, 2019)  - Fix: unable to detect XFCE.* 0.5.2 (Oct 26, 2016)  - Add docs folder into dist file.* 0.5.1 (Oct 25, 2016)  - Fix letter case issue in ``setup.py``.* 0.5.0 (Jul 2, 2016)  - First release.Old Changelog-------------New in desktop 0.4.3 (Changes since desktop 0.4.2)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  * Added missing KDE 4 support to the desktop.dialog module.New in desktop 0.4.2 (Changes since desktop 0.4.1)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  * Added XFCE 4.10 &quot;mailto:&quot; fix contributed by Jérôme Laheurte.New in desktop 0.4.1 (Changes since desktop 0.4)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  * Added KDE 4 and Lubuntu support contributed by Jérôme Laheurte.New in desktop 0.4 (Changes since desktop 0.3)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  * Improved docstrings.  * Fixed support for examining the root window.  * Changed the licence to the LGPL version 3 (or later).New in desktop 0.3 (Changes since desktop 0.2.4)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  * Made desktop a package.  * Added support for graphical dialogue boxes through programs such as    kdialog, zenity and Xdialog.  * Added support for inspecting desktop windows (currently only for X11).New in desktop 0.2.4 (Changes since desktop 0.2.3)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  * Added XFCE support (with advice from Miki Tebeka).  * Added Ubuntu Feisty (7.04) package support.New in desktop 0.2.3 (Changes since desktop 0.2.2)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  * Added Python 2.3 support (using popen2 instead of subprocess).New in desktop 0.2.2 (Changes since desktop 0.2.1)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  * Changed the licence to LGPL.New in desktop 0.2.1 (Changes since desktop 0.2)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  * Added Debian/Ubuntu package support.New in desktop 0.2 (Changes since desktop 0.1)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  * Added support for waiting for launcher processes.  * Added a tests directory.</longdescription>
