	<longdescription>Peewee DB Evolve================Diffs your models against your database, and outputs SQL to(non-destructively) update your schema.Think of it as ``db.create_tables()`` on steriods (which doesn't dropyour database).You can also think of it as schema migrations, without having toactually write the migrations.Quick Start-----------1. Run: ``sudo pip install peewee-db-evolve``2. Add ``import peeweedbevolve`` anywhere before your models are   defined.3. Run ``db.evolve()`` where you would have normally run   ``db.create_tables()``, and enjoy!Example-------See our `HelloWorld &lt;https://github.com/keredson/peewee-db-evolve/tree/master/examples/hello_world&gt;`__example... figure:: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2049665/17993037/1d1c8cf2-6b12-11e6-8591-cd11eb263938.png   :alt: image   imageSupported Databases--------------------  PostgreSQL-  MySQLFrequently Asked Questions--------------------------*Does this work with existing projects, or only with new projects?*This works very well with existing projects. If your API only works withnew projects, you're probably doing it wrong.*Don't you give up control by not writing your own migrations?*Managing your schema by writing your own migrations is kind of likemanaging your source code by writing your own ``patch`` files inaddition to writing your actual code. A well vetted ``diff`` tool isgoing to be better and faster at it than you.*How old / well vetted is this tool?*This project has been in production use since August 2016. (We switchedto Peewee as an ORM.) But it's a style of schema management I've beenusing for ~10 years now.*How can I prevent ``peewee-db-evolve`` from evolving a specific tableor class?*In the class' ``Meta`` class, add ``evolve = False`` and``peewee-db-evolve`` will ignore it. If you don't have a class for aspecific table, just make a do-nothing dummy class for it.Tests-----How to run:.. code:: bash    $ python3 test.py    ..................................................................................................    ----------------------------------------------------------------------    Ran 98 tests in 39.860s    OK</longdescription>
