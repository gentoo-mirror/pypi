	<longdescription># BabyRobotGym### A Reinforcement Learning Gym Environment for Baby Robot![](https://github.com/WhatIThinkAbout/BabyRobotGym/blob/main/notebooks/images/black_maze_run_opt.gif)The code in this repository accompanies the Towards Data Science article _[&lt;b&gt;Creating a Custom Gym Environment for Jupyter Notebooks&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;i&gt;Part 1: Creating the framework&lt;/i&gt;](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-a-custom-gym-environment-for-jupyter-notebooks-e17024474617)_ and shows the steps required to create a custom gym environment with graphical output in a Jupyter notebook.![](https://github.com/WhatIThinkAbout/BabyRobotGym/blob/main/notebooks/images/green_babyrobot_small.gif)## To install:```pip install babyrobot```# Animation ExampleAn example notebook showing how animation and movie creation can be done in the Baby Robot Gym environment:[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/WhatIThinkAbout/BabyRobotGym/HEAD?labpath=notebooks%2FBabyRobot_Animation.ipynb)# API ExampleThe example notebook, showing all of the API calls used to create a Baby Robot Gym environment can be opened here:[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/WhatIThinkAbout/BabyRobotGym/HEAD?labpath=notebooks%2FBabyRobot_API.ipynb)# Reinforcement Learning## Part 1: [State Values and Policy Evaluation](https://towardsdatascience.com/state-values-and-policy-evaluation-ceefdd8c2369)[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/WhatIThinkAbout/BabyRobotGym/HEAD?labpath=notebooks%2FReinforcement%20Learning%2FPart%201%20-%20State%20Values%20and%20Policy%20Evaluation.ipynb)### Training ExampleAn example of using the PPO Reinforcement Learning algorithm to train Baby Robot how to escape from a maze:[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/WhatIThinkAbout/BabyRobotGym/blob/main/notebooks/PPO_Training.ipynb)## Getting the Github Code:### TestingThe test notebook, showing how to run a simple RL environment can be opened here:[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/WhatIThinkAbout/BabyRobotGym/blob/main/baby_robot_gym_test.ipynb)## Cloning the Github repositoryTo get up and running with this simple custom Gym Environment, do the following:## 1\.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Get the code and move to the newly created directory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;:`git clone https://github.com/WhatIThinkAbout/BabyRobotGym.git` &lt;br&gt;`cd BabyRobotGym`* this directory contains the files and folder structure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;## 2\.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Create a Conda environment and install the required packages&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br&gt;To be able to run our environment we need to have a few other packages installed, most notably '_Gym_' itself. To make it easy to setup the environment the Github repo contains a couple of '_.yml_' files that list the required packages. To use these to create a Conda environment and install the packages, do the following (choose the one appropriate for your operating system):On Unix:`conda env create -f environment_unix.yml`&lt;br&gt;On Windows: `conda env create -f environment_windows.yml`&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;## 3\.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Activate the environment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;:We've created the environment with all our required packages, so now it's just a case of activating it, as follows:`conda activate BabyRobotGym`&lt;br&gt;(when you're finished playing with this environment run &quot;conda deactivate&quot; to get back out)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;## 4\.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Run the notebook&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Everything should now be in place to run our custom Gym environment. To test this we can run the sample Jupyter Notebook &lt;i&gt;'baby_robot_gym_test.ipynb'&lt;/i&gt; that's included in the repository. This will load the _'BabyRobotEnv-v1'_ environment and test it using the Stable Baseline's environment checker. To start this in a browser, just type:`jupyter notebook baby_robot_gym_test.ipynb`&lt;br&gt;(When running in jupyter notebook the current Conda environment will automatically be used and the required packages should all be available. It's also possible to run &quot;&lt;i&gt;python -m ipykernel install --user --name=BabyRobotGym&lt;/i&gt;&quot; which will create a Jupyter Notebook kernel, that can then be selected from the notebook's menu.)Or else just open this file in VS Code and make sure _'BabyRobotGym'_ is selected as the kernel. This should make the _'BabyRobotEnv-v1'_ environment, test it in Stable Baselines and then run the environment until it completes, which happens to occur in a single step, since we haven't yet written the 'step' function!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;# Notes:If, while running in a terminal (as opposed to a Jupyter Notebook) you get the warning &quot;DeprecationWarning: Jupyter is migrating its paths to use standard platformdirs&quot;, in a terminal run:`export JUPYTER_PLATFORM_DIRS=1`followed by:`jupyter --paths`</longdescription>
