	<longdescription># pyrosimple[![GitHub Workflow Status](http://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/kannibalox/pyrosimple/pylint.yml?branch=main)](https://github.com/kannibalox/pyrosimple/actions/workflows/pylint.yml)[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyrosimple)](https://pypi.org/project/pyrosimple/)![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pyrosimple)A overhauled Python 3 fork of the [pyrocoretools](https://github.com/pyroscope/pyrocore), for working with the[rTorrent client](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent).## Installation```bashpip install pyrosimple# pip install 'pyrosimple[torque]' # Optional dependencies for using pyrotorque```See the [documentation for usage](https://kannibalox.github.io/pyrosimple/).If you've used rtcontrol/rtxmlrpc before, you should feel right at home.## What's the point of this?The pyrocore tools are great, but being stuck on python 2, along withthe complicated install procedure made integrating both the tools andthe code into other processes very painful.## Differences from pyrocoreThe following lists are not exhaustive, and don't cover many of theinternal improvements and refactoring.- Only supports python 3 and rTorrent 0.9.6+ (this includes  rTorrent-PS and rTorrent-PS-CH)  - pypy is supported, but not as well tested- Simpler poetry-based build system, with a single package to install- Performance improvements (faster templating and only fetching  required fields)### New features- Multi-instance support for rtcontrol/rtxmlrpc- Replaced Tempita with Jinja2- Support for JSON-RPC (only implemented by  https://github.com/jesec/rtorrent)- Actions to move torrent between paths, or torrents between hostsSee https://kannibalox.github.io/pyrosimple/migrate/ for how tomigrate scripts to the new features.## Legacy branchIf you just want to use the pyrocore tools on python 3 without all thenew features, you can use the `release-1.X` branch (1.3 is the latestrelease at time of writing).  These releases will only receive bugfixes or changes to maintain compatibility with the original pyrocoretools.</longdescription>
