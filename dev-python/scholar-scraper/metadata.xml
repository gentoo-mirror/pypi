	<longdescription># Scholar ScraperThis is a simple script to scrape the Google Scholar page of given authors and extract all the information about them (publications, cites per year, etc.).The script is written in Python 3 and uses the [`scholarly`](https://github.com/scholarly-python-package/scholarly)library.&lt;br/&gt;## InstallationThe script can be installed through `pip` and PyPI:```bashpip install scholar-scraper```Or via Github sources:```bashpip install git+https://github.com/guillaume-elambert/Scholar-Scraper-Python-API.git```&lt;br/&gt;Or it can be installed by cloning the repository:```bashgit clone https://github.com/guillaume-elambert/Scholar-Scraper-Python-API.gitcd Scholar-Scraper-Python-APIpip install -e .```&lt;br/&gt;## UsageThe script is simple to use. It takes a list of authors Google Scholar IDs as input and outputs a JSON file with all theinformation about the authors.```pythonfrom scholar_scraper import scholar_scraper# Define the list of authors Google Scholar IDsscholarIds = [     '1iQtvdsAAAAJ',    'dAKCYJgAAAAJ']# Start scraping and print the resulted JSON to the consoleprint(scholar_scraper.start_scraping(scholarIds))```&lt;br/&gt;To reduce the time needed to scrape the authors, the script uses multithreading (one thread per user).&lt;br/&gt;The number of threads can be set using the `max_threads` parameter, which default value 10 :```pythonfrom scholar_scraper import scholar_scraper# Define the maximum number of threads to usemax_threads = 5# Define the list of authors Google Scholar IDsscholarIds = [     '1iQtvdsAAAAJ',    'dAKCYJgAAAAJ']# Start scraping with maximum 5 threads and print the resulted JSON to the console# Since the number of authors is 2, the number of threads used will be reduced to 2# If the number of authors is 10, the number of threads used will be reduced to 5# If you don't pass any value to the max_threads parameter, the default value of 10 will be usedprint(scholar_scraper.start_scraping(scholarIds, max_threads))```&lt;br/&gt;## Output exampleThe output is a JSON file containing all the information about the authors.&lt;br/&gt;Here is an example of the simplified output for the authors with the Google Scholar IDs `1iQtvdsAAAAJ` and `dAKCYJgAAAAJ`:```json[  {    &quot;affiliation&quot;: &quot;Tenure-Track Assistant Professor, DIEM, University of Salerno&quot;,    &quot;citedby&quot;: 796,    &quot;cites_per_year&quot;: {      &quot;2013&quot;: 2,      &quot;2014&quot;: 9,      &quot;2015&quot;: 21,      &quot;2016&quot;: 34,      &quot;2017&quot;: 46,      &quot;2018&quot;: 83,      &quot;2019&quot;: 127,      &quot;2020&quot;: 124,      &quot;2021&quot;: 182,      &quot;2022&quot;: 140,      &quot;2023&quot;: 22    },    &quot;coauthors&quot;: [      {        &quot;affiliation&quot;: &quot;University of Salerno, Dept. of Information and Electrical Engineering and Applied Math (DIEM)&quot;,        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Prof. Mario Vento, Ph.D.&quot;,        &quot;scholar_id&quot;: &quot;3PwXGpgAAAAJ&quot;      },    ],    &quot;interests&quot;: [      &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot;,      &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;,      &quot;Graph Based Representation&quot;    ],    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Vincenzo Carletti, Ph.D.&quot;,    &quot;organization&quot;: 8098754970055108159,    &quot;publications&quot;: [      {        &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Graph matching is essential in several fields that use structured information, such as biology, chemistry, social networks, knowledge management, document analysis and others. Except for special classes of graphs, graph matching has in the worst-case an exponential complexity; however, there are algorithms that show an acceptable execution time, as long as the graphs are not too large and not too dense. In this paper we introduce a novel subgraph isomorphism algorithm, VF3, particularly efficient in the challenging case of graphs with thousands of nodes and a high edge density. Its performance, both in terms of time and memory, has been assessed on a large dataset of 12,700 random graphs with a size up to 10,000 nodes, made publicly available. VF3 has been compared with four other state-of-the-art algorithms, and the huge experimentation required more than two years of processing time.

To this aim two taxonomies are presented and discussed. The first includes almost all the graph matching algorithms proposed from the late seventies, and describes the different classes of algorithms. The second taxonomy considers the types of common applications of graph-based techniques in the Pattern Recognition and Machine Vision field.&quot;,        &quot;author&quot;: &quot;Donatello Conte and Pasquale Foggia and Carlo Sansone and Mario Vento&quot;,        &quot;author_pub_id&quot;: &quot;dAKCYJgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C&quot;,        &quot;citation&quot;: &quot;International journal of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence 18 …, 2004&quot;,        &quot;cites_per_year&quot;: {          &quot;2004&quot;: 10,          &quot;2005&quot;: 29,          &quot;2006&quot;: 25,          &quot;2007&quot;: 60,          &quot;2008&quot;: 50,          &quot;2009&quot;: 62,          &quot;2010&quot;: 78,          &quot;2011&quot;: 97,          &quot;2012&quot;: 115,          &quot;2013&quot;: 127,          &quot;2014&quot;: 147,          &quot;2015&quot;: 157,          &quot;2016&quot;: 152,          &quot;2017&quot;: 144,          &quot;2018&quot;: 121,          &quot;2019&quot;: 128,          &quot;2020&quot;: 108,          &quot;2021&quot;: 109,          &quot;2022&quot;: 84,          &quot;2023&quot;: 9        },        &quot;journal&quot;: &quot;International journal of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence&quot;,        &quot;num_citations&quot;: 1834,        &quot;number&quot;: &quot;03&quot;,        &quot;pages&quot;: &quot;265-298&quot;,        &quot;pub_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218001404003228&quot;,        &quot;pub_year&quot;: 2004,        &quot;publisher&quot;: &quot;World Scientific Publishing Company&quot;,        &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Thirty years of graph matching in pattern recognition&quot;,        &quot;url_related_articles&quot;: &quot;/scholar?oi=bibs&amp;hl=en&amp;oe=ASCII&amp;q=related:Up-aWBC_pBYJ:scholar.google.com/&quot;,        &quot;volume&quot;: &quot;18&quot;      },      {        &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;3 Lyon Research Center for Images and Information Systems UMR CNRS 5205 Bat.
