	<longdescription># pymongo-migrate[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stxnext/pymongo-migrate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stxnext/pymongo-migrate)[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pymongo-migrate.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pymongo-migrate)![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pymongo-migrate.svg)Mongodb migrations using Python.Since mongodb is schema-less most of the time you can do without data migrations.Sometimes tho you want to create some new entities, or migrate old data instead adding another IF statement to your code.This is where `pymongo-migrate` comes in.## Usage    Usage: pymongo-migrate [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...    Options:      --help  Show this message and exit.    Commands:      downgrade  apply necessary downgrades to reach target migration      graph      migrate    automagically apply necessary upgrades or downgrades to reach                 target migration      show       show migrations and their status      upgrade    apply necessary upgrades to reach target migrationThe most used command will be `migrate`, which works can be called like this:    $ pymongo-migrate migrate -u 'mongodb://localhost/test_db' -m tests/migrationsUse `pymongo-migrate command --help` to learn more about particular command.## Development &amp; contributing to the projectContributions and raising Issues is welcome; standard netiquette rules apply.Use `make init` to setup the project for development.To format your code &amp; test your changes run:    make check## AlternativesATM there seem only two active python projects like this: * https://github.com/DoubleCiti/mongodb-migrations * https://github.com/skynyrd/cikilopSo if something already existed, why then another project?Goals of this project, where at least one of them were not fulfilled by above: * tests and CI pipeline for ensuring that tool indeed works * keeping it usable both as standalone tool and as python dependency * use of modern Python version, which allows use of type annotations, dataclasses, f-strings and other goodies## Inspiration and designOther than Alternatives mentioned above, both `alembic` and `django` were used as references when designing this tool.For now only linear revision history is supported.The support for squash migrations is planned.</longdescription>
