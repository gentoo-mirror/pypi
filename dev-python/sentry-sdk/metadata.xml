[Use this migration guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/migration/).- To learn about internals use the [API Reference](https://getsentry.github.io/sentry-python/).## Integrations(If you want to create a new integration, have a look at the [Adding a new integration checklist](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-new-integration).)See [the documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/) for an up-to-date list of libraries and frameworks we support.

You can find the benefits of migrating and how to do it in our [migration guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/migration/).## Contributing to the SDKPlease refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).## Getting Help/SupportIf you need help setting up or configuring the Python SDK (or anything else in the Sentry universe) please head over to the [Sentry Community on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Ww9hbqr).
