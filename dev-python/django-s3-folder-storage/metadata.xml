Instead of extending S3BotoStorage in every project I decided to build a package. The names of those folders are configurable in `settings.py`.## InstallationUse `pip` to install from PyPI:pip install django-s3-folder-storageAdd `s3_folder_storage` to your settings.py file:INSTALLED_APPS = (    ...    's3_folder_storage',    ...)## ConfigurationYou are essentially using `django-storages` for S3 hosting, so you will be using their settings. The two settings that are specific to `django-s3-folder-storage` are `DEFAULT_S3_PATH` and `STATIC_S3_PATH`.Here's an example:DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 's3_folder_storage.s3.DefaultStorage'DEFAULT_S3_PATH = &quot;media&quot;STATICFILES_STORAGE = 's3_folder_storage.s3.StaticStorage'STATIC_S3_PATH = &quot;static&quot;AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = {{ your key id here }}AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = {{ your secret key here }}AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = {{ your bucket name here }}MEDIA_ROOT = '/%s/' % DEFAULT_S3_PATHMEDIA_URL = '//s3.amazonaws.com/%s/media/' % AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAMESTATIC_ROOT = &quot;/%s/&quot; % STATIC_S3_PATHSTATIC_URL = '//s3.amazonaws.com/%s/static/' % AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAMEADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = STATIC_URL + 'admin/'## TroubleshootingDepending on how you have your buckets configured and if you want to use SSL,you may need to use something like the following:MEDIA_URL = 'https://%s.s3.amazonaws.com/media/' % AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAMESTATIC_URL = 'https://%s.s3.amazonaws.com/static/' % AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAMEAs a first step, I recommend trying to get the `collectstatic` managementcommand working within your project:python manage.py collectstaticYou can also run the tests:python manage.py test s3_folder_storageto confirm that files are being written to S3## ContributingThink this needs something else?
