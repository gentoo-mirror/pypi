	<longdescription>=========================Redfish development tools=========================This is a set of simple simulation tools aiming at supporting thedevelopment and testing of the Redfish protocol implementations and,in particular, Sushy library (https://docs.openstack.org/sushy/). Itis not designed for use outside of development and testing environments.Please do not run sushy-tools in a production environment of any kind.The package ships two simulators - static Redfish responder andvirtual Redfish BMC that is backed by libvirt or OpenStack cloud.The static Redfish responder is a simple REST API server whichresponds the same things to client queries. It is effectivelyread-only.The virtual Redfish BMC resembles the real Redfish-controlled bare-metalmachine to some extent. Some client queries are translated to commands thatactually control VM instances simulating bare metal hardware. However someof the Redfish commands just return static content never touching thevirtualization backend and, for that matter, virtual Redfish BMC is similarto the static Redfish responser.* Free software: Apache license* Documentation: https://docs.openstack.org/sushy-tools* Source: http://opendev.org/openstack/sushy-tools* Bugs: https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/openstack/sushy-tools</longdescription>
