	<longdescription>xkcd v2.4.2 |Build Status|==========================A Python interface to xkcd.com~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~By Ben Rosser, released under MIT License (see LICENSE for full text).This is a Python library for accessing and retrieving links to comicsfrom the xkcd webcomic by Randall Munroe. It is NOT endorsed or made byhim, it's an entirely independent project.It makes use of the JSON interface to Randall's site to retrieve comicdata. Both Python 2 and Python 3 are supported, and there are nodependencies beyond the Python standard library, so xkcd's footprintshould be very light.There is support for accessing specific comics, the latest comic, or arandom comic. Comic metadata can be queried and the comics themselvescan be downloaded onto your local system. The goal is simply to providea relatively Pythonic wrapper around the xkcd API for any Python programor library that wants to access information about xkcd comics, for onereason or another.The xkcd module, as of version 2.4.0, also supports getting informationon What If articles from whatif.xkcd.com. This information is generatedby scraping the What If archive page with a HTML parser.Full API documentation is available`here &lt;https://pythonhosted.org/xkcd/&gt;`__.Changelog:----------Version 2.4.2:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-  Switched to using HTTPS URLs for all xkcd queries.Version 2.4.1:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-  Routines that take comic/article numbers (e.g. xkcd.getComic()) now   also can take strings containing cardinal numbers.Version 2.4.0:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-  Added preliminary What If support; routines for querying basic data   about What If articles now exist.-  Comic.download() will create its default directory (~/Downloads) if   it does not already exist, rather than simply failing.-  All prints to standard output are now wrapped in &quot;silent&quot; options   that now default to True (this affects xkcd.getComic and   Comic.download); if silent is set, output won't be printed.-  Significantly improved documentation for all available functions and   classes.Version 2.3.3:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-  Made pypandoc conversion optional; long\_description will be MD   formatted if it cannot be imported (and rST-formatted if it can).Version 2.3.2:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-  Fixed distutils URL to point at TC01/python-xkcd, not TC01/xkcd.-  Started using pypandoc to dynamically turn README.md into a RST   long-description.Version 2.3:~~~~~~~~~~~~-  Fixed ASCII bug in Python 2.x-  Created Sphinx documentation and uploaded it to pythonhosted.orgVersion 2.2:~~~~~~~~~~~~-  Fixed very silly bug with xkcd.getComic()-  Added a getExplanation() which returns an explainxkcd link for a   Comic().-  Added support for Python 3!Version 2.1:~~~~~~~~~~~~-  Fixed bugs with Comic.download() function-  Added optional parameter to Comic.download() to change name of output   file-  Added more information to long\_description textCredits:---------  Ben Rosser rosser.bjr@gmail.com: DeveloperContributions from (github users, unless indicated otherwise):-  @Kyu-  Tanya Sandoval (@tsando).. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/TC01/python-xkcd.svg?branch=master   :target: https://travis-ci.org/TC01/python-xkcd</longdescription>
