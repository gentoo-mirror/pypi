	<longdescription>A Better Sphinx Theme---------------------`Read the documentation`_`See a demo`_.. _Read the documentation: https://sphinx-better-theme.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.. _See a demo: https://sphinx-better-theme.readthedocs.org/en/latest/demos.htmlWhat is this?^^^^^^^^^^^^^This is a modified version of the default Sphinx theme with the followinggoals:1. Remove frivolous colors, especially hard-coded ones2. Improve readability by limiting width and using more whitespace3. Encourage visual customization through CSS, not themeconf4. Use semantic markupv0.1 meets goals one and two. Goal three is partially complete; it's simple toadd your own CSS file without creating a whole new theme. `Open a ticket` ifyou'd like something changed... _Open a ticket: https://github.com/irskep/sphinx-better-theme/issues/newCompatibility&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;sphinx-better-theme is compatible with Sphinx 0.6.4+ and Jinja 2.3.1+. Olderversions may work but have not been tested.Installation^^^^^^^^^^^^Method 1: Adding to your source tree&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;This method is preferred due to the frequency with which sphinx-better-theme isimproved.1. Put the theme in your source tree. If you use git, you can add   ``sphinx-better-theme``'s repository as a submodule. Otherwise you can   `download the zip file`_ and expand it somewhere predictable. Here's an   example using git::        &gt; git submodule add \            https://github.com/irskep/sphinx-better-theme.git \            docs/sphinx-better-theme        &gt; git submodule update --init.. _download the zip file: https://github.com/irskep/sphinx-better-theme/archive/master.zip2. Add the parent folder of the theme to your ``conf.py``. If you use the   folder structure in the block above, you'd do it like this::        html_theme_path = ['sphinx-better-theme']   (because the theme path is ``sphinx-better-theme/better``.)3. Set ``html_theme`` to ``'better'`` in your ``conf.py``.Method 2: Installing to site-packages&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;If adding the theme to your source tree is impractical, if you need to share itamong several repositories, or if you prefer a more serene frequency ofupdates, you can install it like a regular Python package.`Download the zip file`_ and run the usual command::    &gt; python setup.py install.. _Download the zip file.: https://github.com/irskep/sphinx-better-theme/archive/master.zipOr install from PyPI::    &gt; pip install sphinx-better-themeTo use the theme, set ``html_theme_path`` to contain``better.better_theme_path``, and set ``html_theme`` to ``'better'``::    from better import better_theme_path    html_theme_path = [better_theme_path]    html_theme = 'better'</longdescription>
