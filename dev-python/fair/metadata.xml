If run concentration-driven, emissionsare back-calculated. Custom GHGs and SLCFs can be defined, and allcomponents are optional allowing experiments such as pulse-responseanalyses to single forcers or gathering up non-CO~2~ species as anaggregate forcing.## ExamplesThe examples directory contains Jupyter notebooks with somesimple examples showing how to run FaIR and the standalone energybalance model.If you want to try this out online, [gohere](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/OMS-NetZero/FAIR/master?filepath=examples/basic_run_example.ipynb).## Important: A note about calibrating and constrainingFaIR is naive. It will run whatever climate scenario and climateconfiguration you give it. If you violate the laws of physics, FaIRwon\'t stop you. For simple climate models as for complex, garbage inleads to garbage out. More subtle to spot are those analyses with simpleclimate models where the present day warming (or historical) is wrong orthe climate is warming too slowly or too quickly. At least, plot ahistorical temperature reconstruction over your results and see if itlooks right.We have produced IPCC AR6 Working Group 1 consistent probabilisticensembles to run with. The calibration data can be obtained[here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7694879). These parameter sets arecalibrated to CMIP6 models, run in a large Monte Carlo ensemble, andconstrained based on observed and assessed climate metrics. For anexample of how to use this calibration data set with SSP emissions, see[thisexample](https://docs.fairmodel.net/en/latest/examples/calibrated_constrained_ensemble.html).If you\'re writing a paper using FaIR, you should use these. There\'llbe a paper on this at some point, for now please cite the Zenodo DOI.## CitationIf you use FaIR in your work, please cite the following referencesdepending on the version:-   **v2.0+:** Leach, N.
