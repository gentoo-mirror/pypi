A command line tool has been built on top of this library in order to easily gather PFX, NT hashes and TGT on a larger scope.This tool does not exploit any new vulnerability and does not work by dumping the LSASS process memory. Indeed, it only takes advantage of legitimate Windows and Active Directory features (token impersonation, certificate authentication via kerberos &amp; NT hashes retrieval via PKINIT). A [blog post](https://z4ksec.github.io/posts/masky-release-v0.0.3/) was published to detail the implemented technics and how Masky works.Masky source code is largely based on the amazing [Certify](https://github.com/GhostPack/Certify) and [Certipy](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy) tools. I really thanks their authors for the researches regarding offensive exploitation technics against ADCS (see. [Acknowledgments section](#acknowledgments)). ## InstallationMasky python3 library and its associated CLI can be simply installed via the public PyPi repository as following:```pip install masky```The Masky agent executable is already included within the PyPi package.Moreover, if you need to modify the agent, the C# code can be recompiled via a Visual Studio project located in `agent/Masky.sln`. It would requires `.NET Framework 4` to be built.## UsageMasky has been designed as a Python library. Moreover, a command line interface was created on top of it to ease its usage during pentest or RedTeam activities.For both usages, you need first to retrieve the FQDN of a `CA server` and its `CA name` deployed via an ADCS. This information can be easily retrieved via the `certipy find` option or via the Microsoft built-in `certutil.exe` tool. Make sure that the default `User` template is enabled on the targeted CA.Warning: Masky deploys an executable on each target via a modification of the existing `RasAuto` service. Despite the automated roll-back of its intial `ImagePath` value, an unexpected error during Masky runtime could skip the cleanup phase. Therefore, do not forget to manually reset the original value in case of such unwanted stop.### Command lineThe following demo shows a basic usage of Masky by targeting 4 remote systems. Its execution allows to collect NT hashes, CCACHE and PFX of 3 distincts domain users from the sec.lab testing domain.&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/masky_demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Masky CLI demo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Masky also provides options that are commonly provided by such tools (thread number, authentication mode, targets loaded from files, etc. ).```  __  __           _ |  \/  | __ _ ___| | ___   _ | |\/| |/ _` / __| |/ / | | | | |  | | (_| \__ \   &lt;| |_| | |_|  |_|\__,_|___/_|\_\__,  |  v0.0.3                 |___/usage: Masky [-h] [-v] [-ts] [-t THREADS] [-d DOMAIN] [-u USER] [-p PASSWORD] [-k] [-H HASHES] [-dc-ip ip address] -ca CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY [-nh] [-nt] [-np] [-o OUTPUT]             [targets ...]positional arguments:  targets               Targets in CIDR, hostname and IP formats are accepted, from a file or notoptions:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -v, --verbose         Enable debugging messages  -ts, --timestamps     Display timestamps for each log  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS                        Threadpool size (max 15)Authentication:  -d DOMAIN, --domain DOMAIN                        Domain name to authenticate to  -u USER, --user USER  Username to authenticate with  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD                        Password to authenticate with  -k, --kerberos        Use Kerberos authentication.

Please look at the `masky\lib\results.py` module to check the methods and attributes provided by these two classes.### Standalone Masky agentFrom the Masky version 0.0.5, the standalone executable agent can now easily be ran without the Python CLI.Here are the arguments:```$&gt; .\Masky.exe /ca:'CA SERVER\CA NAME' (/template:User) (/currentUser) (/output:./output.txt) (/debug:./debug.txt)```The `/ca` parameter is mandatory as for the Python CLI. Moreover, the `/currentUser` argument has been added to avoir running token impersonation. Indeed, a simple certificate request will be performed in the current user context, based on the provided template (`template`). The `/output` and `/debug` parameters allow to specify the path where will be created the files.The default values are the following:- currentUser: false (aka. impersonation is enabled);- template: User;- output: ./Masky_results.txt- debug: ./Masky_debug.txt&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;./assets/masky_agent_standalone.png&quot; alt=&quot;Masky standalone agent demo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;## Acknowledgments- [Olivier Lyak](https://twitter.com/ly4k_) for the [Certipy](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy) tool and the [associated articles](https://medium.com/@oliverlyak)- [Will Schroeder](https://twitter.com/harmj0y) and [Lee Christensen](https://twitter.com/tifkin_) for the [Certify](https://github.com/GhostPack/Certify) tool and the [Certified Pre-Owned](https://www.specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf) article- [Dirk-jan](https://twitter.com/_dirkjan) for the [PKINITtools](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools) and its [ADCS NTLM relay](https://dirkjanm.io/ntlm-relaying-to-ad-certificate-services/) article- [SecureAuthCorp](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp) and the associated contributors for the [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) library- [Pixis](https://twitter.com/HackAndDo) for the tool [Lsassy](https://github.com/Hackndo/Lsassy)- Incognito tool and its [Metasploit implementation](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-payloads/blob/master/c/meterpreter/source/extensions/incognito/)- [S3cur3Th1sSh1t](https://twitter.com/ShitSecure) for the tool [SharpImpersonation](https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/SharpImpersonation) and the [associated article](https://s3cur3th1ssh1t.github.io/SharpImpersonation-Introduction/)- McAfee for their article regarding the [token impersonation techniques](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-access-token-theft-manipulation-attacks.pdf)</longdescription>
