It implements state-of-the-art AI models that are general enough to solve real world tasks with no data required from the user.&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;   &lt;img src=&quot;.github/kiri-example.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Out of the box tasks you can solve with Kiri:- Conversational question answering in English (for FAQ chatbots, text analysis, etc.)- Text Classification in 100+ languages (for email sorting, intent detection, etc.)- Image Classification (for object recognition, OCR, etc.)- Text Vectorisation in 50+ languages (semantic search for ecommerce, documentation, etc.)- Summarisation in English (TLDRs for long documents)- Emotion detection in English (for customer satisfaction, text analysis, etc.)- Text Generation (for idea, story generation and broad task solving)For more specific use cases, you can adapt a task with little data and a couple of lines of code using finetuning. We are adding finetuning support for all tasks soon.You can run all tasks locally or in production with our optimised inference [API](https://kiri.ai), where you only pay for usage. It includes all the tasks, models in our library and lets you upload your own finetuned models.| âš¡ [Getting started](#getting-started)                            | Installation, few minute introduction     || :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- || ðŸ’¡ [Examples](https://github.com/kiri-ai/kiri/tree/main/examples) | Sample problems solved using Kiri         || ðŸ“™ [Docs](https://kiri.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)                 | In-depth documentation for advanced usage |## Getting started### InstallationInstall Kiri via PyPi:```bashpip install kiri```### Basic task solving```pythonfrom kiri import Kiricontext = &quot;Take a look at the examples folder to see use cases!&quot;# Use our inference APIk = Kiri(api_key=&quot;abc&quot;)# Or run locallyk = Kiri(local=True)# Start building!answer = k.qa(&quot;Where can I see what to build?&quot;, context)print(answer)# Prints&quot;the examples folder&quot;```### Basic finetuning and uploading```pythonfrom kiri.models import T5from kiri.tasks import TextGenerationtg = TextGeneration(T5, local=True)# Any text works as training datainp = [&quot;I really liked the service I received!&quot;, &quot;Meh, it was not impressive.&quot;]out = [&quot;positive&quot;, &quot;negative&quot;]# Finetune with a single line of codetg.finetune(inp, out)# Use your trained modelprediction = tg(&quot;I enjoyed it!&quot;)print(prediction)# Prints&quot;positive&quot;# Upload to Kiri for production ready inferenceimport kirimodel = tg.model# Describe your modelmodel.name = &quot;t5-sentiment&quot;model.description = &quot;Predicts positive and negative sentiment&quot;kiri.upload(model, api_key=&quot;abc&quot;)```## Why Kiri?1. No experience needed   - Entrance to practical AI should be simple   - Get state-of-the-art performance in your task without being an expert2. Data is a bottleneck   - Use AI without needing access to &quot;big data&quot;   - With transfer learning, no data is required, but even a small amount can adapt a task to your niche.3. There is an overwhelming amount of models   - We implement the best ones for various tasks   - A few general models can accomplish more with less optimisation4. Deploying models cost effectively is hard work   - If our models suit your use case, no deployment is needed   - Adapt and deploy your own model with a couple of lines of code   - Our API scales, is always available, and you only pay for usage## ExamplesTake a look at the [examples folder](https://github.com/kiri-ai/kiri/tree/main/examples).## DocumentationCheck out our [docs](https://kiri.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).</longdescription>
