In fact, it always tracks `latest` of `~&gt; 0.7` with every release. If there are scenarios where you explicitly have to pin your provider version, you can do so by generating the [provider constructs manually](https://cdk.tf/imports).These are the upstream dependencies:* [Terraform CDK](https://cdk.tf)* [Terraform time Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/time/0.7.0)  * This links to the minimum version being tracked, you can find the latest released version [in our releases](https://github.com/cdktf/cdktf-provider-time/releases)* [Terraform Engine](https://terraform.io)If there are breaking changes (backward incompatible) in any of the above, the major version of this project will be bumped.## Features / Issues / BugsPlease report bugs and issues to the [terraform cdk](https://cdk.tf) project:* [Create bug report](https://cdk.tf/bug)* [Create feature request](https://cdk.tf/feature)## Contributing### projenThis is mostly based on [projen](https://github.com/eladb/projen), which takes care of generating the entire repository.### cdktf-provider-project based on projenThere's a custom [project builder](https://github.com/hashicorp/cdktf-provider-project) which encapsulate the common settings for all `cdktf` providers.### Provider VersionThe provider version can be adjusted in [./.projenrc.js](./.projenrc.js).### Repository ManagementThe repository is managed by [Repository Manager](https://github.com/hashicorp/cdktf-repository-manager/)</longdescription>
