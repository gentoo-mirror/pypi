	<longdescription>Introduction============This is the rpkg project, which mostly is a python library for dealing withrpm packaging in a git source control.  pyrpkg is the base library that sitescan subclass to create useful tools.rpkg works with Python 2.7, 3.6, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11.License=======Unless otherwise specified, all files are licensed under GPLv2+.Installation============Install from distribution packages----------------------------------rpkg is available in Fedora and EPEL repositories. It can be installed withpackage manager command. There is Python 3 package for Fedora and EPEL8;and Python 2 package in EPEL7.Install in a Fedora system::    sudo dnf install python3-rpkgInstall in EPEL7::    sudo yum install python2-rpkgInstall in EPEL8::    sudo dnf install python3-rpkgInstall in a Python virtual environment---------------------------------------Both Python 2 and 3 packages are published in PyPI. Install rpkg in a Python 3virtual environment in these steps::    python3 -m venv .env    source .env/bin/activate    pip install rpkg rpm-py-installerYou are free to create a virtual environment with option ``--system-site-packages``.Please note that, rpkg depends on some other utilities to build packages. Thesepackages are required to be installed as well.* ``mock``: for local mockbuild.* ``rpm-build``:  for local RPM build, which provides the command line ``rpm``.* ``rpmlint``: check SPEC.* ``copr-cli``: for building package in `Fedora Copr`_.* ``module-build-service``: for building modules... _`Fedora Copr`: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/Contribution============You are welcome to write patches to fix or improve rpkg. All code should workwith Python 2.7, and 3. Before you create a PR to propose your changes,make sureSign-off commit---------------Make sure to sign-off your commits by ``git commit -s``. This serves as aconfirmation that you have the right to submit your changes. See `DeveloperCertificate of Origin`_ for details... _Developer Certificate of Origin: https://developercertificate.org/Run Tests---------Before make a pull request, ensure local changes pass all test cases.Before run tests, install these packages::    sudo dnf install python27 python36 python39 git make gcc rpm-build \    rpm-devel libcurl-devel krb5-devel openssl-devel python3-develTo run tests simply, ``make test``.By default, target ``test`` runs tests with all supported Python versions.However, if you look into ``Makefile``, there is still a target ``tox`` thatallows developer to run tests with test environments one by one.Links=====* Documentation: https://docs.pagure.org/rpkg* Upstream GIT: https://pagure.io/rpkg* Issue tracker: https://pagure.io/rpkg/issues</longdescription>
