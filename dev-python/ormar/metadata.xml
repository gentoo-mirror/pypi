in name - gets its name from _ormar_ in Swedish which means _snakes_, and _ormar_ in Croatian which means _cabinet_.And what's a better name for python ORM than snakes cabinet :)**If you like ormar remember to star the repository in [github](https://github.com/collerek/ormar)!**The bigger community we build, the easier it will be to catch bugs and attract contributors ;)### DocumentationCheck out the [documentation][documentation] for details.**Note that for brevity most of the documentation snippets omit the creation of the databaseand scheduling the execution of functions for asynchronous run.**If you want more real life examples than in the documentation you can see the [tests][tests] folder,since they actually have to create and connect to a database in most of the tests.Yet remember that those are - well - tests and not all solutions are suitable to be used in real life applications.### Part of the `fastapi` ecosystemAs part of the fastapi ecosystem `ormar` is supported in libraries that somehow work with databases.As of now `ormar` is supported by:*  [`fastapi-users`](https://github.com/frankie567/fastapi-users)*  [`fastapi-crudrouter`](https://github.com/awtkns/fastapi-crudrouter)*  [`fastapi-pagination`](https://github.com/uriyyo/fastapi-pagination)If you maintain or use a different library and would like it to support `ormar` let us know how we can help.### DependenciesOrmar is built with:* [`sqlalchemy core`][sqlalchemy-core] for query building.* [`databases`][databases] for cross-database async support.* [`pydantic`][pydantic] for data validation.* `typing_extensions` for python 3.6 - 3.7### License`ormar` is built as open-sorce software and will remain completely free (MIT license).As I write open-source code to solve everyday problems in my work or to promote and build strong pythoncommunity you can say thank you and buy me a coffee or sponsor me with a monthly amount to help ensure my work remains free and maintained.&lt;a aria-label=&quot;Sponsor collerek&quot;

Database creationBecause ormar is built on SQLAlchemy core, you can use [`alembic`][alembic] to providedatabase migrations (and you really should for production code).For tests and basic applications the `sqlalchemy` is more than enough:```python# note this is just a partial snippet full working example below# 1. Importsimport sqlalchemyimport databases# 2. InitializationDATABASE_URL = &quot;sqlite:///db.sqlite&quot;database = databases.Database(DATABASE_URL)metadata = sqlalchemy.MetaData()# Define models here# 3. Database creation and tables creationengine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(DATABASE_URL)metadata.create_all(engine)```For a sample configuration of alembic and more information regarding migrations anddatabase creation visit [migrations][migrations] documentation section.### Package versions**ormar is still under development:**We recommend pinning any dependencies (with i.e. `ormar~=0.9.1`)`ormar` also follows the release numeration that breaking changes bump the major number,while other changes and fixes bump minor number, so with the latter you should be safe toupdate, yet always read the [releases][releases] docs before.`example: (0.5.2 -&gt; 0.6.0 - breaking, 0.5.2 -&gt; 0.5.3 - non breaking)`.### Asynchronous PythonNote that `ormar` is an asynchronous ORM, which means that you have to `await` the calls tothe methods, that are scheduled for execution in an event loop. Python has a builtin module[`asyncio`][asyncio] that allows you to do just that.Note that most &quot;normal&quot; python interpreters do not allow execution of `await`outside of a function (because you actually schedule this function for delayed executionand don't get the result immediately).In a modern web framework (like `fastapi`), the framework will handle this for you, but ifyou plan to do this on your own you need to perform this manually like described in thequick start below.### Quick StartNote that you can find the same script in examples folder on github.```pythonfrom typing import Optionalimport databasesimport pydanticimport ormarimport sqlalchemyDATABASE_URL = &quot;sqlite:///db.sqlite&quot;database = databases.Database(DATABASE_URL)metadata = sqlalchemy.MetaData()# note that this step is optional -&gt; all ormar cares is a internal# class with name Meta and proper parameters, but this way you do not# have to repeat the same parameters if you use only one databaseclass BaseMeta(ormar.ModelMeta):    metadata = metadata    database = database# Note that all type hints are optional# below is a perfectly valid model declaration# class Author(ormar.Model):#     class Meta(BaseMeta):#         tablename = &quot;authors&quot;##     id = ormar.Integer(primary_key=True) # &lt;= notice no field types#     name = ormar.String(max_length=100)class Author(ormar.Model):    class Meta(BaseMeta):        tablename = &quot;authors&quot;    id: int = ormar.Integer(primary_key=True)    name: str = ormar.String(max_length=100)class Book(ormar.Model):    class Meta(BaseMeta):        tablename = &quot;books&quot;    id: int = ormar.Integer(primary_key=True)    author: Optional[Author] = ormar.ForeignKey(Author)    title: str = ormar.String(max_length=100)    year: int = ormar.Integer(nullable=True)# create the database# note that in production you should use migrations# note that this is not required if you connect to existing databaseengine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(DATABASE_URL)# just to be sure we clear the db beforemetadata.drop_all(engine)metadata.create_all(engine)# all functions below are divided into functionality categories# note how all functions are defined with async - hence can use await AND needs to# be awaited on their ownasync def create():    # Create some records to work with through QuerySet.create method.    # Note that queryset is exposed on each Model's class as objects    tolkien = await Author.objects.create(name=&quot;J.R.R.
