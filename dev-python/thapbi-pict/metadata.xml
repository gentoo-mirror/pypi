ITS1 is short forInternal Transcribed Spacer one, which is a region of eukaryotes genomesbetween the 18S and 5.8S rRNA genes. This is commonly used for molecularbarcoding, where sequencing this short region can identify species.With appropriate primer settings and a custom database of full length markers,THAPBI PICT can be applied to other organisms and/or barcode marker sequences- not just *Phytophthora* ITS1. It requires overlapping paired-end Illuminareads which can be merged to cover the *full* amplicon marker. Longer markersor fragmented amplicons are not supported. Internally it works by trackingunique amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), using MD5 checksums as identifiers.The worked examples include oomycetes, fungi, fish, bats, and plants, andcover markers in ITS1, ITS2, 12S, 16S, COI, and more. The main criteria hasbeen mock communities with known species composition.Installation------------We recommend installing this tool on Linux or macOS using the`Conda &lt;https://conda.io/&gt;`__ packaging system, via the`BioConda &lt;https://bioconda.github.io/&gt;`__ channel, which will handle*all* the dependencies:.. code:: console   $ conda install thapbi-pictAlternatively or on Windows, since `the software is on the Python PackageIndex (PyPI) &lt;https://pypi.org/project/thapbi-pict/&gt;`__, the following commandwill install it along with its Python dependencies:.. code:: console   $ pip install thapbi-pictHowever, in this case you will still need to install various external commandline tools. See ``INSTALL.rst`` for more details (especially for Windows),and if you want to modify the software read ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` as well.Quick Start-----------Once installed, you should be able to run the tool at the command lineusing:.. code:: console   $ thapbi_pictThis should automatically find the installed copy of the Python code.Use ``thapbi_pict -v`` to report the version, or ``thapbi_pict -h`` forhelp.Documentation-------------The `tool documentation &lt;https://thapbi-pict.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_ is hosted by`Read The Docs &lt;https://readthedocs.org/&gt;`_, generated automatically from the``docs/`` folder.The documentation includes more detailed discussion of the sample datasetsin the ``examples/`` folder (which are based on published datasets).Citation--------If you use THAPBI PICT in your work, please cite this manuscript (to appear inthe journal *PeerJ* but currently only available as a preprint), and givedetails of the version and any non-default settings used in your methods:    Cock *et al.* (2023) &quot;THAPBI PICT - a fast, cautious, and accurate    metabarcoding analysis pipeline&quot; *bioRxiv*    https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.24.534090You can also cite the software specifically via Zenodo which offers versionspecific DOIs as well as https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4529395 which is forthe latest version.Funding-------The initial work was supported from 2016 to 2019 under the Tree Health andPlant Biosecurity Initiative (THAPBI) Phyto-Threats project:  This research was supported by a grant funded jointly by the  Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (`BBSRC  &lt;https://bbsrc.ukri.org/&gt;`_), Department for Environment, Food and Rural  affairs (`DEFRA &lt;https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs&gt;`_),  Economic and Social Research Council (`ESRC &lt;https://esrc.ukri.org&gt;`_),  `Forestry Commission &lt;https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/forestry-commission&gt;`_,  Natural Environment Research Council (`NERC &lt;https://nerc.ukri.org&gt;`_)  and `Scottish Government &lt;https://www.gov.scot/&gt;`_, under the Tree  Health and Plant Biosecurity Initiative, grant number ``BB/N023463/1``.Work from 2020 to 2021 was supported in part under the *Early detection ofPhytophthora in EU and third country nurseries and traded plants (ID-PHYT)*Euphresco project:  Funded by DEFRA as part of the Future Proofing Plant Health project in  support of Euphresco ID-PHYT.Work from 2022 to 2027 was partly funded by the Rural &amp; Environment Science&amp; Analytical Services (RESAS) Division of the Scottish Government.Background----------THAPBI PICT continues earlier work including:- https://github.com/widdowquinn/THAPBI- https://github.com/widdowquinn/THAPBI-pycits- https://github.com/peterthorpe5/THAPBI-pycits- https://github.com/peterthorpe5/public_scripts/tree/master/metapy- https://github.com/peterthorpe5/public_scripts/tree/master/metapy_toolsRelease History---------------See the ``CHANGELOG.rst`` file.Development Notes-----------------See file ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` for details of the development setup includingPython style conventions, git pre-commit hook, continuous integration and testcoverage, and release process.</longdescription>
