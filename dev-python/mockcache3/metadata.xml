	<longdescription>The Python dictionary-based mock memcached client library. It does notconnect to any memcached server, but keeps a dictionary and stores every cacheinto there internally. It is a just emulated API of memcached client only fortests. It implements expiration also. NOT THREAD-SAFE.This module and other memcached client libraries have the same behavior.It is a fork from [mockcache](https://github.com/lunant/mockcache) to supportnew Python versions and fix a few bugs.</longdescription>
