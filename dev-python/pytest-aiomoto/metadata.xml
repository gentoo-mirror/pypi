During the initial phases of this project, it is likely that some releases  could introduce breaking changes in test fixtures.  It's highly  recommended pinning this dependency to patch releases during the  0.x.y releases.- This package could restrict available versions of aws libs, including:  aiobotocore, botocore, boto3, and moto.- The fixtures in this package might not be optimized for concurrent testing.  It is not known yet whether the fixtures are thread safe or adequately  randomized to support parallel test suites.## InstallationYou can install &quot;pytest-aiomoto&quot; via pip    $ pip install pytest-aiomoto## UsageTo list the available fixtures    $ pytest --fixturesThis project attempts to provide some common fixtures for commonly usedservices.  As such, it is not a generic package for any services; themoto project provides that and this project builds on that.  Thisproject aims to create some useful fixtures that behave nearly thesame way for both synchronous clients (botocore) andasynchronous clients (aiobotocore).## ContributingContributions are welcome, if you build similar common fixtures or buildon the existing package fixtures.  The details for bug fixes could becomplicated, due to the dependencies on aiobotocore and moto.Please review [github collaboration](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests)practices.  Once you clone your fork of the repository:    cd pytest-aiomoto    make init    make testOn OSX, use `gmake` from Homebrew to get GNU make &gt; 4.x.It's recommended that development use python 3.8, to avoid introducing any pythoncode that might not be compatible with the minimum version of python supported.  Thisis important in the context of the general evolution of asyncio in python.Most development is done in a linux context (e.g. Ubuntu LTS).  If some developmenttools or common practices are not working as expected on OSX or Windows, there islimited support for adapting to various development environments.Tests are run with [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest), please ensurethe percentage of coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.The expectation for contributions might be a slow process, please do not anticipateany turn around on the order of days (unless you're already a core contributor).Using your own fork can be a faster way to evolve your fixtures for your use cases.## Release VersionsInstall [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) and use it to install[versionner](https://msztolcman.github.io/versionner/).```shellpipx install versionnerver --help```With `pipx` and `versionner` installed, it can be used to manage releasesfor any python library.  See the documentation for `ver` for details onhow to manage sem-ver library releases.  See `.versionner.rc` file fordetails of the project configuration.## IssuesIf you encounter any problems, please[file an issue](https://github.com/dazza-codes/pytest-aiomoto/issues)along with a detailed description.# LicenseDistributed under the terms of the[Apache Software License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0),&quot;pytest-aiomoto&quot; is free and open source software.```textCopyright 2019-2023 Darren WeberLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;);you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.You may obtain a copy of the License at   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, softwaredistributed under the License is distributed on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.See the License for the specific language governing permissions andlimitations under the License.```# NoticesInspiration for this project comes from testing the[aio-aws](https://github.com/dazza-codes/aio-aws) project,which uses the Apache 2 license.</longdescription>
