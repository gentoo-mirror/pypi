	<longdescription>## Installation```pip3 install text2digits```## UsagePython 3 only!```from text2digits import text2digitst2d = text2digits.Text2Digits()t2d.convert(&quot;twenty ten and twenty one&quot;)&gt; 2010 and 21```It can handle a variety of phrases. Spoken/Informal and formal language:```&quot;A random string&quot; -&gt; 'A random string'&quot;I am thirty six years old with a child that is four. I would like to get him four cars!&quot; -&gt; 'I am 36 years old with a child that is 4. I would like to get him 4 cars!'&quot;I was born in twenty ten&quot; -&gt; 'I was born in 2010'&quot;I was born in nineteen sixty four&quot; -&gt; 'I was born in 1964'&quot;I am the fourth cousin&quot; -&gt; 'I am the 4 cousin'&quot;I am twenty nine&quot; -&gt; 'I am 29'&quot;it was twenty ten and was negative thirty seven degrees&quot; -&gt; 'it was 2010 and was negative 37 degrees'&quot;thirty twenty one&quot; -&gt; '3021'&quot;one thousand six hundred sixty six&quot; -&gt; '1666'&quot;one thousand and six hundred and sixty six&quot; -&gt; '1666'&quot;sixteen sixty six&quot; -&gt; '1666'&quot;eleven hundred twelve&quot; -&gt; '1112'&quot;Sixteen and seven&quot; -&gt; '16 and 7'&quot;twenty ten and twenty one&quot; -&gt; '2010 and 21'&quot;I was born in nineteen ninety two and am twenty six years old!&quot; -&gt; 'I was born in 1992 and am 26 years old!'&quot;three forty five&quot; -&gt; '345'```I find this useful if using Alexa/Lex to convert audio to text and have to convert the text to digits.## Improvements/Issues- Still need to add support for decimal numbers- Need to add support for negative numbers## AcknowledgementsI have heavily used code from the SO answers from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/493174/is-there-a-way-to-convert-number-words-to-integersand improved upon them</longdescription>
