It is designed to be higher-levelthan boto (it's built on top of botocore), to make simple operations easier toperform and understand.Features--------* Mypy-typed API* Python object wrappers for most AWS data structures* Automatic serialization of built-in types, with hooks for custom types* Automatic paging of results* Automatic batching for batch_write_item* Exponential backoff of requests when throughput is exceeded* Throughput limits to self-throttle requests to a certain rate* Nose plugin for running DynamoDB LocalDynamoDB features that are not yet supported--------------------------------------------* Reading from streams* Adding/removing tags on a table* Table backups* Scanning with segments* Table replicas (Global tables version 2019.11.21)* Table auto scaling* DAXNote that you can still access these APIs by using ``DynamoDBConnection.call``,though you may prefer to go straight to boto3/botocore.Changelog=========1.0.0-----* Removed the legacy API (scan, query, update_item, delete_item, put_item, get_item)* Renamed the new API methods to match the old ones (e.g. scan2 -&gt; scan, query2 -&gt; query)* Moved constant values into ``dynamo3.constants``. This is where you can now find STRING, BINARY, etc* Added mypy typing where possible* Drop support for Python 2* Add support for table billing mode (aka on-demand tables)* Add support for SSE, TTL, and transactions0.4.10------* Fixed DynamoDB Local link in testing framework0.4.9-----* Feature: Result objects from get_item have an ``exists`` flag* Feature: ``wait`` keyword for create and delete table0.4.8-----* Bug fix: Scans/Queries could return incomplete results if AWS returned an empty Items list0.4.7-----* New ``RateLimit`` class to avoid blowing through your provisioned throughput0.4.6-----* New ``Limit`` class for more complex query limit behavior* Bug fix: Scan and Query with ``Select='COUNT'`` will page results properly0.4.5-----* batch_get supports ``alias`` arg for ExpressionAttributeNames0.4.4-----* Make connection stateless again. Puts consumed_capacity into response object and fixes mystery crash.0.4.3-----* Bug fix: getting ConsumedCapacity doesn't crash for BatchGetItem and BatchWriteItem* Feature: connection.default_return_capacity* Feature: hooks for ``precall``, ``postcall``, and ``capacity``* Better handling of ConsumedCapacity results0.4.2-----* Feature: New methods to take advantage of the newer expression API. See get_item2, put_item2.* Feature: Shortcut ``use_version`` for switching over to the new APIs.0.4.1-----* Feature: update_table can create and delete global indexes* Feature: New methods to take advantage of the newer expression API. See scan2, query2, update_item2, and delete_item2.0.4.0-----* Migrating to botocore client API since services will be deprecated soon0.3.2-----* Bug fix: Serialization of blobs broken with botocore 0.85.00.3.1-----* Bug fix: Crash when parsing description of table being deleted0.3.0-----* **Breakage**: Dropping support for python 3.2 due to lack of botocore support* Feature: Support JSON document data typesFeatures thanks to DynamoDB upgrades: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/dynamodb-update-json-and-more/0.2.2-----* Tweak: Nose plugin allows setting region when connecting to DynamoDB Local0.2.1-----* Feature: New, unified ``connect`` method0.2.0-----* Feature: More expressive 'expected' conditionals* Feature: Queries can filter on non-indexed fields* Feature: Filter constraints may be OR'd togetherFeatures thanks to DynamoDB upgrades: http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/improved-queries-and-updates-for-dynamodb/0.1.3-----* Bug fix: sometimes crash after deleting table* Bug fix: DynamoDB Local nose plugin fails0.1.2-----* Bug fix: serializing ints fails0.1.1-----* Feature: Allow ``access_key`` and ``secret_key`` to be passed to the ``DynamoDBConnection.connect_to_*`` methods0.1.0-----* First public release</longdescription>
