	<longdescription># Add css classes: A Plugin for PelicanAdds CSS classes to html tags in Pelican documents## MotivationWhen we want to create a page or article we often use Markdown or RST. This allows us towrite content very fast, but it gives us little to no control over the styling of our page.That is why I created this plugin for Pelican so we can add classes to HTML elements inside `pelicanconf.py`.## Usage### Both pages and articlesTo set css classes that should be added to elements in both pages and articles you can use `ADD_CSS_CLASSES`.You can also set which css classes should be added to elements on pages with `ADD_CSS_CLASSES_TO_PAGE`.And this can also be done with articles using `ADD_CSS_CLASSES_TO_ARTICLE`.#### ExampleLet's say you want to configure all tables to use Bootstrap, show black tables on pages and red headers on articles.```pythonADD_CSS_CLASSES = {    &quot;table&quot;: [&quot;table&quot;]}ADD_CSS_CLASSES_TO_PAGE = {    &quot;table&quot;: [&quot;table&quot;, &quot;table-dark&quot;]}ADD_CSS_CLASSES_TO_ARTICLE = {    &quot;h1&quot;: [&quot;text-danger&quot;]}```Installation------------This plugin can be installed via:    pip install pelican-add-css-classesContributing------------Contributions are welcome and much appreciated.
