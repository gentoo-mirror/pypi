	<longdescription># Objectiv Bach: Pandas-like analytics modeling translated to SQLBach is a Python-based analytics modeling library with a Pandas-like interface. It translates all operations and models to SQL, running directly on your full dataset. All DataFrames &amp; models can be converted to an SQL statement with just a single command, to use in other tools like dbt or BI.Bach is part of [Objectiv](https://objectiv.io/), an open-source data collection &amp; modeling platform that helps data teams run product analytics from their notebooks. Bach therefore works with any dataset that embraces Objectiv's [open analytics taxonomy](https://objectiv.io/docs/taxonomy/), so you can take pre-built models from the [open model hub](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/open-model-hub/) to quickly build deep analyses for a wide range of product &amp; marketing use cases.## InstallationTo install Bach, use the following command:```bashpip install objectiv-bach           # just the Bach library, supports PostgreSQL out of the boxpip install objectiv-bach[bigquery] # for Google BigQuery supportpip install objectiv-bach[athena]   # for AWS Athena support```See how to [get started in your notebook](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/get-started-in-your-notebook/) for detailed installation instructions.## Usage* [Example notebooks with instructions](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/example-notebooks/)* [Bach API reference](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/bach/api-reference/) ## Support* [Visit Objectiv Docs for instructions &amp; FAQs](https://objectiv.io/docs/)* [Join Objectiv on Slack to get help](https://objectiv.io/join-slack/)* [Request a feature or report an issue on Github](https://github.com/objectiv/objectiv-analytics)**Found a security issue?**Please donâ€™t use the issue tracker but contact us directly.
