It's very useful when using transientJupyterHub instances in a single physical location. It allows multiple users to log in, but you do not have install a pre-existing authentication setup. With this authenticator, users can just pick a username and password and get to work!## InstallationYou can install this authenticator with:```bashpip install jupyterhub-firstuseauthenticator```Once installed, configure JupyterHub to use it by adding the following to your `jupyterhub_config.py` file:```pythonc.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = 'firstuseauthenticator.FirstUseAuthenticator'```## Configuration### FirstUseAuthenticator.dbm_pathPath to the [dbm](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/dbm.html) file, or a UNIX database file such as `passwords.dbm`, used to store usernames and passwords. The dbm file should be put where regular users do not have read/write access to it.This authenticator's default setting for the path to the `passwords.dbm` is the current directory from which JupyterHub is spawned.### FirstUseAuthenticator.create_usersCreate users if they do not exist already.When set to False, users would have to be explicitly created beforethey can log in. Users can be created via the admin panel or by settingwhitelist / admin list.Defaults to True.## FAQ### Why have a password DB and not use PAM ?For security Reasons. Users are likely to set an, insecure password atlogin time, and you do not want a brute-force/dictionary attack to manage tologin by attacking via ssh or another mean.### How can I change my password?To change your password, you should login in your jupyterhub account, go to `&lt;your_server_ip&gt;/hub/auth/change-password` and change the password. ### I'm getting an error when creating my usernameUsernames cannot contain spaces or commas. Please check if your username is free of these characters. ## SecurityWhen using `FirstUseAuthenticator` it is advised to automatically prepend thename of the user with a known-prefix (for example `jupyter`). This would preventfor example, someone to log-in as `root`, as the created user would be`jupyter-root`.</longdescription>
