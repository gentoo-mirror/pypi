	<longdescription>========================================================NIPYPE: Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces========================================================Current neuroimaging software offer users an incredible opportunity toanalyze data using a variety of different algorithms. However, this hasresulted in a heterogeneous collection of specialized applicationswithout transparent interoperability or a uniform operating interface.*Nipype*, an open-source, community-developed initiative under theumbrella of `NiPy &lt;http://nipy.org&gt;`_, is a Python project that provides auniform interface to existing neuroimaging software and facilitates interactionbetween these packages within a single workflow. Nipype provides an environmentthat encourages interactive exploration of algorithms from differentpackages (e.g., AFNI, ANTS, BRAINS, BrainSuite, Camino, FreeSurfer, FSL, MNE,MRtrix, MNE, Nipy, Slicer, SPM), eases the design of workflows within andbetween packages, and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype is creating a collaborative platform for neuroimaging software development in a high-level language and addressing limitations of existing pipeline systems.*Nipype* allows you to:* easily interact with tools from different software packages* combine processing steps from different software packages* develop new workflows faster by reusing common steps from old ones* process data faster by running it in parallel on many cores/machines* make your research easily reproducible* share your processing workflows with the community</longdescription>
