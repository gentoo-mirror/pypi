	<longdescription>Utilities for handling IEEE 754 floating point special valuesThis python module implements constants and functions for working withIEEE754 double-precision special values.  It provides constants forNot-a-Number (NaN), Positive Infinity (PosInf), and Negative Infinity(NegInf), as well as functions to test for these values.The code is implemented in pure python by taking advantage of the'struct' standard module. Care has been taken to generate properresults on both big-endian and little-endian machines. Some efficiencycould be gained by translating the core routines into C.See &lt;http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs341/IEEE-754references.html&gt;for reference material on the IEEE 754 floating point standard.Further information on this package is available at&lt;http://www.analytics.washington.edu/statcomp/projects/rzope/fpconst/&gt;.------------------------------------------------------------------Author:    Gregory R.
