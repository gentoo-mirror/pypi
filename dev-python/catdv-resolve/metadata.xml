	<longdescription># Installation## ServerEnsure that your CatDV server is sufficiently up-to-date (&gt;=10.1.4).## Client### Prerequisite: Python 3For DaVinci Resolve 16 / 17 (older):- These versions of DaVinci resolve are unsupported.For DaVinci Resolve 17 (recent)/18:- Install any version of Python from 3.7 through 3.10 ([Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads))- Preferably, the latest version of [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3109/)*Note: All downloads are at the bottom of linked pages. Scroll down!*### ModuleOpen a new terminal window.\On Windows, use `pip`, `python` for the following commands; on Mac/*nix use `pip3`, `python3`1) Ensure you are executing the intended python version:   ```bash   python --version2) Optional step:   Install the wheel package to utilise Python's newer package install methods.   ```bash   pip install wheel   ```3) Install the package:    ```bash    pip install catdv_resolve    ```4) Finalise the installation:    ```bash    python -m catdv_resolve install    ```    (This step creates a symbolic link so that DaVinci Resolve can find the plugin's files).For advanced users: [Advanced Installation](#advanced-installation)# UsageIn DaVinci Resolve, - Select `Workspace` from the toolbar at the top of the window;- select the `Scripts` option from the drop-down (near the bottom); - Choose `CatDV` to open the plugin's panel.- You will be prompted to enter the URL for your CatDV Web Panel.- Login to your account using the `Login` button located at the top-right.# UpgradeSometimes new versions of the software may be released; to upgrade the installed version of the panel, use a terminal to execute the following commands:1) ```bash   pip install --upgrade catdv_resolve   ```2) ```bash   python -m catdv_resolve install --force   ```# Advanced InstallationThe package can also be installed into a Python virtual environment (`venv`) of the appropriate Python version.1) Ensure you are executing the intended python version:    ```bash    python --version    ```2) Create a new `venv` using the Virtualenv tool:    ```bash    python -m venv [target]    ```    E.g. `python3 -m venv ./venv310` is an ideal choice for a Python 3.10 `venv`.    Following instructions assume the `target` provided was `./venv310`.3) Activate the `venv`:    #### Windows    ```cmd    .\venv310\Scripts\activate.bat    ```    #### Mac / Linux / *nix    ```bash    source ./venv310/bin/activate    ```4) Optional step:   Install the wheel package to utilise Python's newer package install methods.   ```bash   pip install wheel   ```5) Install the package:    ```bash    pip install catdv_resolve    ```6) Finalise the installation:    ```bash    python -m catdv_resolve install    ```    (This step creates a symbolic link so that DaVinci Resolve can find the plugin's files).
