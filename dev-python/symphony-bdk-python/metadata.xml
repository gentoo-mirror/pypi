Be sure you have it installed before going further.We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) in order to manage dependencies, build, run tests and publish.To install poetry, follow instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).On the first time, run `poetry install`. Then run `poetry build` to build the sdist and wheel packages.To run the tests, use `poetry run pytest`.It is possible to run pylint scan locally (on a specific file or package) executing the following command:`poetry run pylint &lt;module_name&gt;`.To generate locally the Sphinx documentation, run: `cd docsrc &amp;&amp; make html`.## RoadmapOur next milestone is the [2.5.x](https://github.com/finos/symphony-bdk-python/milestone/6) one.It will only consist in delivering the next improvements and bug fixes of the BDK.## ContributingIn order to get in touch with the project team, please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/finos/symphony-bdk-python/issues).Alternatively, you can email/subscribe to [symphony@finos.org](https://groups.google.com/a/finos.org/g/symphony).1. Fork it2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/fooBar`)3. Read our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Community Code of Conduct](https://www.finos.org/code-of-conduct)4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'`)5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/fooBar`)6. Create a new Pull Request_NOTE:_ Commits and pull requests to FINOS repositories will only be accepted from those contributors with an active,executed Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) with FINOS OR who are covered under an existing and activeCorporate Contribution License Agreement (CCLA) executed with FINOS.Commits from individuals not covered under an ICLA or CCLA will be flagged and blocked by the FINOS Clabot tool.Please note that some CCLAs require individuals/employees to be explicitly named on the CCLA.*Need an ICLA? Unsure if you are covered under an existing CCLA? Email [help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org)*### Update generated codeWhile contributing to the project, you might need to update the generated code.Python BDK uses [OpenAPITools/openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/) to generate code. In order to customise the templates, a fork has been created in [https://github.com/SymphonyPlatformSolutions/openapi-generator/tree/sym-python-5.5.0](https://github.com/SymphonyPlatformSolutions/openapi-generator/tree/sym-python-5.5.0).  Here are the steps to follow:- Checkout the latest branch of the fork (currently [sym-python-5.5.0](https://github.com/SymphonyPlatformSolutions/openapi-generator/tree/sym-python-5.5.0))- Update the fork source code, review and merge it- Generate a jar file in `openapi-generatormodules/openapi-generator-cli/target/openapi-generator-cli.jar`:  - Using maven: `mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true &amp;&amp; mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true`. _You can also use IntelliJ's build button to build the project and generate the jar_- Copy the jar in Python BDK repository `symphony-api-client-python/api_client_generation/openapi-generator-cli.jar`- Execute the generation script `./generate.sh` and commit and push you new code along with the new jar file.## LicenseCopyright 2021 Symphony LLCDistributed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).SPDX-License-Identifier: [Apache-2.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)</longdescription>
