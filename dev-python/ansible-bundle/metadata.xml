	<longdescription># ansible-bundleSmall tool for automatic download roles and libs a-la-Gemfile# PreambleAs many roles have changed their configurations among time, anyone would use aspecific version of a role (for instance, a commit, or a branch, or a tag).Moreover, a complex playbook could need different versions from the same role. This app will download roles (bundles, from now on) from their repositories before launching a playbook. _That means that a role should be inits own repository_.# Prerequisites- Ansible. Any version.- Git &gt;= 1.8.5- Python 2 &gt;= 2.6# Installation## The easy way: pip`sudo pip install ansible-bundle`## The not-that-easy way: from code- Download [latest release](../../archive/master.zip)- Run `sudo python setup.py`# Syntax`ansible-bundle FILEYAML [ansible-playbook-options] [ansible-bundle-options]`ansible-bundle, along the ansible-playbook parameters, has also these:- `--bundle-clean-roles` Will clean roles and library directories before download (*)- `--bundle-dry` Shows what will be run (as it won't download anything, also won't search for dependencies)- `--bundle-deps-only` Don't run the playbook, just satisfy dependencies.- `--bundle-disable-color` Useful for non-interactive consoles- `--bundle-workers` concurrent connections when downloading/updating roles. Default: 1- `--bundle-safe-update` Don't clean existing roles. (*)(*) If both `bundle-clean-roles` and `bundle-safe-update` are set, `bundle-clean-roles` will take effect.# Configurationansible-bundle expects to find a `[bundle]` section into ansible.cfg, which may contain some of the command lines parameters:- workers- verbosity- safeAnd the following extra options:- `url`: URL where the roles are located. For example, if role `apache` is in `github.com/foo/roles/apache`, the `url` should be set to `github.com/foo/roles`.Default is 'https://github.com'## bundle.cfg example[bundle]url='git@github.com:devopsysadmin/ansible-roles'workers=5verbosity=1# Example of useGiven the following playbook (site.yml):- include: site-common.yml  tags:    - common- hosts: all  roles:    - postgresql@1.0    - { role: apache, version: '2.4' }Running `ansible-bundle site.yml` will search roles into the `site-common.yml` file and add to download queue, which already includes postgresql 1.0 and apache master.Please note that each role is intended to be in its own repository, not in a folder.# Changelog## v 0.6- Syntax role/version changes to role@version. This simplifies the configuration inansible.cfg and allows branches names such as feature/something in role version.If a versioned role with the previous syntax is found, will complain with adeprecation warning. The previous syntax will be obsoleted in v 0.7.# AuthorDavid Pedersen (david.3pwood AT gmail DOT com)# LicenseGNU Public License v2 (GPLv2)</longdescription>
