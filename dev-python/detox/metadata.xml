	<longdescription>[![Project Status: Unsupported – The project has reached a stable, usable state but the author(s) have ceased all work on it.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/unsupported.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#unsupported)# detox is unmaintained and incompatible with tox &gt; 3.6`detox` was a plugin for [`tox`](https://pypi.org/project/tox/) to enable parallel environment execution. `tox` 3.7 added a native possibility to do this (`tox -p|--parallel`) and effectively supercedes detox.---[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tox-dev/detox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tox-dev/detox)[![Latest Version on PyPI](https://badge.fury.io/py/detox.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/detox)[![Supported Python Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/detox.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/detox/)[![Code Style: Black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/ambv/black)# What is detox?detox is the distributed version of [tox](https://pypi.org/project/tox/).  It makes efficient use of multiple CPUs by running all possible activities in parallel.  It has the same options and configuration that tox has so after installation can just run:    detoxin the same way and with the same options with which you would run `tox`, see the [tox home page](http://tox.readthedocs.io) for more info.Additionally, detox offers a `-n` or `--num` option to set the number of concurrent processes to use.**NOTE** due to the concurrent execution of the testenvs the output of the different testruns is not printed to the terminal. Instead they are logged into separate files inside the `log` directories of the testenvs.# CHANGELOG## 0.19- as tox added a parallel mode in 3.7 detox will only work with older versions of tox now so the installation requires a version of tox &lt; 3.7- mark repository as unmaintained- add a warning at the end of the testrun hinting the user to try it without detox and a version of tox &gt; 3.6## 0.18Note that usedevelop still does not seem to be fixed (PRs welcome)- integrate usable fixes from stale PR7    - (fix [#20](https://github.com/tox-dev/detox/issues/20) detox      ignores/breaks usedevelop - by Kendall Chuang    - (fix [#21](https://github.com/tox-dev/detox/issues/21)      detox doesn't support skipsdist config option - by Kendall Chuang- convert changelog to markdown and render as part of description on PyPI- detox version now prints own version and then what tox has to say  (it's a plugin after all and that should be made clear)- [Internal changes]    - add extra dependencies in setup.py    - update tests to current pytest API    - use black for code formatting    - use flake8 for linting    - add descriptions to tox envs    - add a &quot;dev&quot; tox env## 0.17 (botched release)## 0.16 (not released)## 0.15- (fix [#23](https://github.com/tox-dev/detox/issues/23)) do not    swallow exceptions - by @vlaci- (fix [#16](https://github.com/tox-dev/detox/issues/16)) use tox    quiet level to make detox quiet - by Oliver Bestwalter## 0.14.post3- and now the markdown description might even be rendered## 0.14.post2- *sigh* replace hardcoded long description with actual content of    `README.md`## 0.14.post1- propagate information about new location of issie tracker to PyPI## 0.14.0- (fix [#15](https://github.com/tox-dev/detox/issues/15)) make detox    aware of new way to fetch a package in tox 3.3 - by Oliver    Bestwalter- (fix [#15](https://github.com/tox-dev/detox/issues/15)) make detox    aware of new way to fetch a package in tox 3.3 - by Oliver    Bestwalter- (fix [#25](https://github.com/tox-dev/detox/issues/25)) print out    detox version rather than tox version including detox version as    plugin, when invoking [detox --version]{.title-ref} - by Oliver    Bestwalter## 0.13.0- (fix [#283](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/283)) detox    creates virtualenvs repeatedly and unnecessarily - by Thomas Steinke## 0.12.0- (fix [#792](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/792)) bump tox    version constraint to &lt;4.0 - by Pi Delport- support and test with Python 2.7, 3.4+ - by Miro Hrončok- fix project url to point ot github - by Neil Halelamien- remove some unused imports - by Nir Soffer## 0.11.0- #406: Add support for running detox as python -m detox Thanks André    Caron (@AndreLouisCaron).- (infrastructure) add Travis CI setup. Thanks Timothée Mazzucotelli    (@Pawamoy).- add &quot;-n NUMPROC&quot; option to set number of processes. The default is    the number of CPUs as determined by multiprocessing.cpu_count() or    &quot;2&quot; if the call does not work (e.g. on py27/windows). Thanks    Timothée Mazzucotelli (@Pawamoy).## 0.10.0- get compatible again to tox-2.0## 0.9.4- get compatible again to eventlet by avoiding to import    eventlet.processes, thanks Takeshi Komiya for the PR.- make detox honor skipsdist. Thanks Timoth Messier for the PR.- change license to MIT## 0.9.3- fix issue6: quickly make detox work with tox-1.6 again (although not    all 1.6 features supported, e.g. --develop does not work)- fix issue3: don't claim a TROVE identifier of &quot;python3&quot; because    detox itself depends on eventlet which does not work on py3 yet.    (Nevertheless detox will create py3 environments through tox of    course)- fix issue1: support python2.5 again (although we might drop it in    the future -- it's enough of tox/detox can _[create]() and handle    py25 environments, they don't neccessarily need to support running    themselv on py25)## 0.9.2- fix issue4 - fail properly if sdist-packaging fails## 0.9.1- fix issue5 - small adjustments to work with latest tox-1.4.3 version## 0.9- initial release</longdescription>
