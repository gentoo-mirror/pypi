	<longdescription>Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics (LFD) file formats=======================================================Lfdfiles is a Python library and console script for reading, writing,converting, and viewing many of the proprietary file formats usedto store experimental data and metadata at the`Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics &lt;https://www.lfd.uci.edu/&gt;`_.For example:- SimFCS VPL, VPP, JRN, BIN, INT, CYL REF, BH, BHZ FBF, FBD, B64, I64, Z64, R64- GLOBALS LIF, ASCII- CCP4 MAP- Vaa3D RAW- Bio-Rad(r) PIC- Vista IFLI, IFI- FlimFast FLIF:Author: `Christoph Gohlke &lt;https://www.cgohlke.com&gt;`_:License: BSD 3-Clause:Version: 2022.9.29Installation------------Install the lfdfiles package and common dependencies from thePython Package Index::    python -m pip install -U lfdfiles tifffile matplotlibBinary wheels are currently available for Windows only. On other platforms,a Python distutils compatible C compiler is required to install the packagefrom source.This release has been tested with the following requirements and dependencies(other versions may work):- `CPython 3.8.10, 3.9.13, 3.10.7, 3.11.0rc2 &lt;https://www.python.org&gt;`_  (win-amd64 platforms, 32-bit platforms are deprecated)- `Cython 0.29.32 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/cython/&gt;`_ (build)- `NumPy 1.22.4 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/numpy/&gt;`_- `Tifffile 2022.8.12  &lt;https://pypi.org/project/tifffile/&gt;`_  (optional)- `Czifile 2019.7.2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/czifile/&gt;`_ (optional)- `Oiffile 2022.2.2 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/oiffile /&gt;`_ (optional)- `Netpbmfile 2022.9.12 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/netpbmfile /&gt;`_ (optional)- `Matplotlib 3.5.3 &lt;https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/&gt;`_  (optional, for plotting)- `Click 8.1 &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/click&gt;`_  (optional, for command line usage)Revisions---------2022.9.29- Fix setup.py.2022.9.20- Update metadata.2022.6.10- Fix LfdFileSequence with tifffile 2022.4.22.- Add fbd2b64 conversion function and script.- Add decoder for 32-bit, 8 windows, 4 channels FLIMbox data from Spartan-6.- Convert docstrings to Google style with Sphinx directives.2022.2.2- Add type hints.- SimfcsFit.asarray returns dc_ref only; use p_fit for fit params (breaking).- Remove additional positional arguments to LfdFile init (breaking).- Guess SimfcsBin shape and dtype if not provided (breaking).- Use TiffWriter.write instead of deprecated save.- Drop support for Python 3.7 and NumPy &lt; 1.19 (NEP29).2021.7.15- Refactor SimfcsFbd initialization.- Print tracebacks of failing plugins in LfdFile.2021.7.11- Calculate pixel_dwell_time and frame_size for FBD files with header.- Disable simfcsfbd_decode and simfcsfbd_histogram Python code (breaking).2021.6.25- ...Refer to the CHANGES file for older revisions.Notes-----Lfdfiles is currently developed, built, and tested on Windows only.The API is not stable yet and might change between revisions.The latest `Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015-2022&lt;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads&gt;`_ is required on Windows.Many of the LFD's file formats are not documented and might change arbitrarily.This implementation is mostly based on reverse engineering existing files.No guarantee can be made as to the correctness of code and documentation.Experimental data are often stored in plain binary files with metadataavailable in separate, human readable journal files (`.jrn`).Unless specified otherwise, data are stored in little-endian, C contiguousorder.For command line usage run ``python -m lfdfiles --help``.References----------The following software is referenced in this module:1.  `SimFCS &lt;https://www.lfd.uci.edu/globals/&gt;`_, a.k.a.
