It stands for Northwestern University Source Separation Library (or our less-branded backronym: &quot;Need Unmixing? Source Separation Library!&quot;). Whether you're a researcher creating novel network architectures or new signal processing approaches for source separation or you just need an out-of-the-box source separation model, nussl contains everything you need for modern source separation, from prototyping to evaluation to end-use.# DocumentationTutorials, code examples, and the API reference are available at the documentationwebsite which is [available here.](https://nussl.github.io/docs/)# Features## Deep Learningnussl contains a rich feature set for deep learning models, including a built in trainer with support for many common datasets in music and speech separation.nussl also has a External File Zoo where users are able to download pre-trainedmodels on many different datasets with a number of different configurations. ### Training Your Own Algorithmsnussl makes it easy to train your own algorithms, with many common architectures,datasets, and configurations ready-built for many use cases, and an easy way toextend our built-in functionality for your own needs. There are many pre-built usefulmodules that are easy to piece together, such as LSTMs, GRUs, convolutional layers,fully conneected layers, mask layers, embedding layers. Everything is built on PyTorch, so adding a brand new module is a snap!### Using Your Own Datanussl has existing support for many popular source separation datasets, like MUSDB18,WSJ0, WHAM!, and FUSS. nussl also defines a simple directory structure to add in any data you want.Want to augment your data? We have support for datasets created with [Scaper](https://scaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) built in so youcan train on magnitudes more training data. ### Downloading Pre-trained ModelsPre-trained models on speech separation, music separation, and more are availablefor download at the [External File Zoo (EFZ)](http://nussl.ci.northwestern.edu/),and there is a built in python API to download models you want from within your code.## Deep Learning ArchitecturesWe provide the following architectures available out of the box:* Mask Inference* Deep Clustering* Chimera* OpenUnmix (Soon!)* TasNet (Soon!)* DualPath RNN (Soon!)(See docs for corresponding citations)## Classical AlgorithmsAdditionally, nussl also contains implementations of many classical source separationalgorithms, including:* Spatialization algorithms: DUET, PROJET* Factorization-based Methods: RPCA, ICA* Primitive Methods: Repetition (REPET, 2DFT), Harmonic/Percussive, Vocal melody extraction, Timbre clustering* Benchmark Methods: High Pass filter, Binary Masks, Ratio Masks, Weiner Filtering## Interactionnussl supports light interaction via [gradio](https://www.gradio.app/).To launch a web interface where you can upload audio and hearseparations, simply do:```pythonimport nussl# Make a dummy signal to instantiate object.dummy_signal = nussl.AudioSignal()# Create some separation object with desired config.# This will use the 2DFT algorithm, but since interaction# is implemented in the base separation object, it is# available to every algorithm.ft2d = nussl.separation.primitive.FT2D(dummy_signal)# Launch the Gradio interface. Use `share=True` to make# a public link that you can share! Warning - people with# access to the link will be running code on YOUR# machine.ft2d.interact()```Or all at once, using `share=True` to create a public link that you cangive to others.```bash&gt;&gt;&gt; import nussl&gt;&gt;&gt; nussl.separation.primitive.HPSS(nussl.AudioSignal()).interact(share=True)Running locally at: http://127.0.0.1:7860/This share link will expire in 6 hours. If you need a permanent link, email support@gradio.appRunning on External URL: https://22218.gradio.app```This will launch an interface that looks like this:&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;docs/gradio-interface.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;## Evaluationnussl has many built in evaluation measures to determine how well your algorithm did, includingthe museval measure (BSSEvalV4), SI-SDR, SI-SIR, SI-SAR, SD-SDR, SNR, and more! We seek to provide a thorough framework for evaluating your source separation research.# Installationnussl is on the Python Package Index (PyPI), so it is easy to install with pip:```$ pip install nussl```**Note: Requires python 3.7+**For the functionality in ``nussl.play_utils``, you'll want IPython, and ``ffmpeg``, installed as well:```$ pip install IPython$ brew install ffmpeg # on mac$ apt-get install ffmpeg # on linux```To use the Melodia separation algorithm, you'll need to specify this:```$ pip install &quot;nussl[melodia]&quot;````vamp` doesn't install on some MacOS versions, so we can't include it by default.To actually use Melodia, you'll also need the Melodia plugin. For installationinstructions, look [here](https://github.com/justinsalamon/melodia_python_tutorial/blob/master/melodia_python_tutorial.ipynb).Augmentation effects are applied via either PySox or SoxBindings, if on Linux or MacOS.`soxbindings` can't be installed from PyPI on Windows, but it may be installable from source.For source installation instructions, look [here](https://github.com/pseeth/soxbindings). Otheraugmentation effects are applied via FFMpeg.# CitingIf you are using nussl for your research project, we please ask that you cite it using one of the following bibtex citations:    @inproceedings {nussl        author = {Ethan Manilow and Prem Seetharaman and Bryan Pardo},        title = &quot;The Northwestern University Source Separation Library&quot;,        publisher = &quot;Proceedings of the 19th International Society of Music Information Retrieval             Conference ({ISMIR} 2018), Paris, France, September 23-27&quot;,        year = 2018    }# Issues and ContributionsSee the [contribution guide](https://nussl.github.io/docs/contributing.html) fordetailed information. But the basics are: bug fixes/enhancements/etc have the standard githubprocess; but, when adding new algorithms, contributors must provide benchmark files, paper references, and trained models (if applicable). Please see the issues page before contacting the authors.# Contributors- Prem Seetharaman &lt;http://github.com/pseeth&gt;- Ethan Manilow &lt;http://github.com/ethman&gt;- Fatemeh Pishdadian &lt;http://github.com/fpishdadian&gt;- Nathan Shelly &lt;https://github.com/nathanshelly&gt;- Andreas Bugler &lt;https://github.com/abugler&gt;- Bryan Pardo &lt;https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~pardo/&gt;Former:- Corey Grief &lt;http://github.com/cegrief&gt;- Daniel Felix Kim &lt;http://github.com/DanielFelixKim&gt;- Ben Kalish &lt;https://github.com/BenKalish42&gt;nussl's REPET, REPET-SIM implementations are based on MATLAB code from Zafar Rafii.
