Unfortunately this means you can't format an indented block of code.* `pyls-black` will use your project's [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/ambv/black#pyprojecttoml) if it has one.See the [wiki](https://github.com/rupert/pyls-black/wiki) for instructions on how to use `pyls-black` with popular text editors.</longdescription>
