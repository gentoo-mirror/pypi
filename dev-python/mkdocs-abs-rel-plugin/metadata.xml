While this makes sense there are situation where it is useful to make use of absolute links. For example when creating a document with absolute links to an image folder. If that file is to be moved later on, links are kept intact.## Installation```bashpip install mkdocs-abs-rel-plugin```## UsageIn your `mkdocs.yml` file add `abs-to-rel` to the plugins entry:```yamlplugins:  - abs-to-rel```</longdescription>
