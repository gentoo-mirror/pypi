Then run `json-explorer` from the command line:```json-explorer data_from_an_undocumented_API.jsonl```If you just want to try it out but don't have JSONs in a file, you canrun `json-explorer --example` to see how it works with example data.This will pop up a web page that helps you explore the properties ofthe objects, what data types are in there, what values are unique, andmore.From there, you might use `jq` or `jmespath` to write something tomore read the data that you're interested in using.For more details, see the [fulldocumentation](https://stringertheory.github.io/json-explorer/&gt;).### Other tools to help with JSON dataThis tool is intended for quick and dirty exploration of JSONs. Ifthat's not what you need, there are a *lot* of great resources forworking with JSON data. Here is an [awesomelist](https://github.com/burningtree/awesome-json).There are a couple tools in the python ecosystem that complement JSONExplorer:- [GenSON](https://github.com/wolverdude/genson/) can create a [JSON  Schema](https://json-schema.org/) from a group of JSONs.- [jmespath.py](https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.py). The official  Python implementation fo the JMESPath query language for JSON.Also, there are many tools for viewing/navigating individual JSONs, a - [JSON View](https://jsonview.com/). A simple browser extension to  view JSONs, that's available for several browsers.- [JSON Hero](https://jsonhero.io/). A full-featured JSON  visualization tool.</longdescription>
