	<longdescription># viASP![Test Status](https://github.com/glaserL/viasp/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml/badge.svg)**viASP visualizes an interactive explanation of your ASP program and its stable models**![Example visualization](docs/img/header.png)viASP allows you to explore the visualization in a variety of ways:* Toggle parts of the program* Show the added symbols or all of them* Inspect a single model* Add `#show` statements on the fly* Search models, signatures and rules.To use viASP you don't have to change your ASP programs at all. You only have to execute them using the clingo pythonAPI.# Installation`pip install viasp`will install all necessary dependencies.## Usage### OverviewviASP has two parts, its frontend [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com) component and the backend server. To get everythingrunning, do the following:1. `viasp` (or `viasp &amp;` to run it in the background)2. Start your dash app, a basic version can be found at [`examples/minimal_dash.py`](examples/minimal_dash.py)3. Replace `clingo.Control` with `viasp.Control` in your python scripts and use `viasp.mark(model)` to select the models   you want to show### Quick startIf you don't have any scripts handy that use the python API of clingo, you can use our quickstart script.**IMPORTANT** You will still need to start viasp (`viasp` or `viasp &amp;`)Then run [`examples/quickstart.py`](examples/quickstart.py).It works very similar to the usual `clingo`, you can call it as `python quickstart.py encoding.lp` oreven `cat encoding | python quickstart.py`If you want to filter the models you have to edit the script, however.If you now run your ASP programs, you can inspect them using viASP at [http://127.0.0.1:8050/](http://127.0.0.1:8050/)or what ever port you have set.If you want to learn more about Dash, check out their [documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/layout).## LimitationsviASP only works if you run your ASP programs using the python API, e.g.:```pythonfrom viasp import Controlprogram = &quot;&quot;&quot;rain; sprinkler.wet :- rain.wet :- sprinkler.&quot;&quot;&quot;ctl = Control([&quot;0&quot;])ctl.add(&quot;base&quot;, [], program)ctl.ground([(&quot;base&quot;, [])])with ctl.solve(yield_=True) as handle:    for model in handle:        ctl.viasp.mark(model)ctl.viasp.show()```</longdescription>
