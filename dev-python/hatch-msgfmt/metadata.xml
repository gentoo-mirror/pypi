	<longdescription># hatch-msgfmtA hatch msgfmt plugin, simply replacing all po files with mo files, using msgfmt in `PATH`.At a future point, a pure-python version could be implemented, by implementinga pure-Python version of msgfmt.  [The standard cpython msgfmt.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Tools/i18n/msgfmt.py) could be a startingpoint for this, but it's not as capable as GNU Gettext, and doesn't supportplural forms.  Even with a fresh implementation, handling the file encodingfrom the header is challenging, especially for variable-length encodings likeEUC-JP, which could feasibly cause particular problems.Better to just use the system one for now.  If somebody wants to submit a pure-python implementation that functions, I'll gladly integrate it as a separate`msgfmtpy` plugin in the same repository.# Config parameters* `locales`: The location of the source `.po` files.* `destination`: The location of the destination `.mo` files.  They will be put  into this location in the same structure as the source tree relative to the  `locales` path.* `pathsub_regex` (optional): An input regex to match against source files for  name changes.* `pathsub_replace` (required if `pathsub_regex` is present): An replacement  pattern to use for name changes.# CopyrightThis plugin is Copyright 2023 Absolute Performance, Inc. with contributions by[Adri√°n Chaves](https://github.com/Gallaecio).MIT licensed.</longdescription>
