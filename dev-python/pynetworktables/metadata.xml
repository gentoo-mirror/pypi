	<longdescription>RobotPy NetworkTables Project=============================This is a pure python implementation of the NetworkTables protocol, derivedfrom the wpilib ntcore C++ implementation. In FRC, the NetworkTables protocolis used to pass non-Driver Station data to and from the robot across the network.This implementation is intended to be compatible with python 3.5 and later.All commits to the repository are automatically tested on all supported pythonversions using github actions... note:: NetworkTables is a protocol used for robot communication in the          FIRST Robotics Competition, and can be used to talk to          SmartDashboard/SFX. It does not have any security, and should never          be used on untrusted networks... note:: If you require support for Python 2.7, use pynetworktables 2018.2.0Documentation-------------For usage, detailed installation information, and other notes, please seeour documentation at http://pynetworktables.readthedocs.ioDon't understand this NetworkTables thing? Check out our `basic overview ofNetworkTables &lt;http://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/nt.html&gt;`_.Installation------------On the RoboRIO, you don't install this directly, but use the RobotPy installerto install it on your RoboRIO, or it is installed by pip as part of thepyfrc setup process.On something like a coprocessor, driver station, or laptop, make sure pip isinstalled, connect to the internet, and install like so:::    pip install pynetworktablesSupport-------The RobotPy project has a mailing list that you can send emails to forsupport: robotpy@googlegroups.com. Keep in mind that the maintainers ofRobotPy projects are also members of FRC Teams and do this in their freetime.If you find a bug, please file a bug report using githubhttps://github.com/robotpy/pynetworktables/issues/newContributing new changes------------------------RobotPy is an open project that all members of the FIRST community caneasily and quickly contribute to.
