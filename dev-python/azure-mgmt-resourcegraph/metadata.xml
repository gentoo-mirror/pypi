	<longdescription># Microsoft Azure SDK for PythonThis is the Microsoft Azure Resource Graph Client Library.This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.For a more complete view of Azure libraries, see the [azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).# UsageTo learn how to use this package, see the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)For docs and references, see [Python SDK References](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/)Code samples for this package can be found at [Resourcegraph Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&amp;term=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing&amp;terms=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing) on docs.microsoft.com.Additional code samples for different Azure services are available at [Samples Repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)# Provide FeedbackIf you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the[Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)section of the project.![Impressions](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2Fazure-mgmt-resourcegraph%2FREADME.png).# Release History## 8.0.0 (2021-03-31)**Features**  - Model QueryRequest has a new parameter management_groups  - Model QueryRequestOptions has a new parameter allow_partial_scopes**Breaking changes**  - Model QueryRequest no longer has parameter management_group_id  - Removed operation ResourceGraphClientOperationsMixin.resource_changes  - Removed operation ResourceGraphClientOperationsMixin.resource_change_details## 7.0.0 (2020-12-15)- GA Release## 7.0.0b1 (2020-10-20)This is beta preview version.This version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).**General breaking changes**- Credential system has been completly revamped:  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user  - For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)**General new features**- Type annotations support using `typing`. SDKs are mypy ready.- This client has now stable and official support for async. Check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.- This client now support natively tracing library like OpenCensus or OpenTelemetry. See this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.## 2.1.0 (2020-03-15)**Features**- Added operation group GraphQueryOperations## 2.0.0 (2019-06-19)**General Breaking changes**This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*introduce breaking changes for some import. In summary, some moduleswere incorrectly visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixedseveral issues caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to beused in the first place.  - ResourceGraphClient cannot be imported from    `azure.mgmt.resourcegraph.resource_graph_client` anymore (import    from `azure.mgmt.resourcegraph` works like before)  - ResourceGraphClientConfiguration import has been moved from    `azure.mgmt.resourcegraph.resource_graph_client` to    `azure.mgmt.resourcegraph`  - A model `MyClass` from a &quot;models&quot; sub-module cannot be imported    anymore using `azure.mgmt.resourcegraph.models.my_class` (import    from `azure.mgmt.resourcegraph.models` works like before)Last but not least, HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default.You should always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), oruse no more than one client per process.## 1.1.0 (2019-06-11)**Note**This version was incorrectly released with breaking changes inside. Youshould use 1.0 or directly move to 2.0 if want to follow semanticversionning closely.**Breaking changes**  - Result format can be table or objectArray## 1.0.0 (2019-03-28)  - Increment the version to show it as GA version no change in the    contract.## 0.1.0 (2018-09-07)  - Initial Release</longdescription>
