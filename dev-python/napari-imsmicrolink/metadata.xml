Chem. 2018, 90, 21, 12395â€“12403](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b02884). This plugin is a work-in-progress but is mostly functional.__N.B.__ This tool is __NOT__ a general purpose registration framework to find transforms between IMS (MALDI or otherwise)and microscopy. It is built to align MALDI IMS pixels to their corresponding laser ablation marks as captured by microscopy AFTER the IMS experiment. This approach has the advantage of providing direct evidence of registration performance as IMS pixels are aligned to their _explicit spatial origin_ in microscopy space, improving overall accuracy and confidence of microscopy-driven IMS data analysis.## InstallationYou can install `napari-imsmicrolink` via [pip]:    pip install napari-imsmicrolink### Typical experiment workflow1. Acquire pre-IMS microscopy (autofluorescence, brightfield) - _optional_2. Perform normal IMS sample preparation.3. Acquire post-IMS microscopy (autofluorescence, brightfield) with matrix still on samplethat reveals laser ablation marks.4. Gather IMS data that contains XY integer coordinates for the IMS experiment   (.imzML, Bruker spotlist (.txt, .csv), Bruker peaks.sqlite (_FTICR_),   Bruker .tsf (TIMS qTOF only))5. Run `napari-imsmicrolink` with data 3 and 46. Once registered, use `wsireg` to align other microscopy modalities to IMS-registered post-IMSmicroscopy----------------------------------This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using with [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.&lt;!--Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-startedand review the napari docs for plugin developers:https://napari.org/docs/plugins/index.html--&gt;## ContributingContributions are very welcome.
