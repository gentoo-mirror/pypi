	<longdescription>Diviner: Grouped Timeseries Forecasting at scale================================================Diviner is an execution framework wrapper around popular open source time series forecasting libraries.The aim of the project is to simplify the creation, training, orchestration, and MLOps logistics associated withforecasting projects that involve the predictions of many discrete independent events.|docs| |build| |examples| |core| |pypi| |license| |downloads|.. |docs| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-success.svg?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=readthedocs    :target: https://databricks-diviner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest    :alt: Documentation.. |build| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/databricks/diviner/Test%20package%20build?label=Build%20CI&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github    :target: https://github.com/databricks/diviner/actions/workflows/test-package-build.yml    :alt: Build CI.. |examples| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/databricks/diviner/Examples?label=Examples&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github    :target: https://github.com/databricks/diviner/actions/workflows/examples.yml    :alt: Examples CI.. |core| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/databricks/diviner/Diviner%20tests?label=Core%20CI&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github    :target: https://github.com/databricks/diviner/actions/workflows/main.yml    :alt: Core CI.. |pypi| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/diviner.svg?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=pypi&amp;logoColor=white    :target: https://pypi.org/project/diviner/    :alt: Latest Python Release.. |license| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=apache    :target: https://github.com/databricks/diviner/blob/main/LICENSE.txt    :alt: Apache 2 License.. |downloads| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/diviner?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=pypi&amp;logoColor=white    :target: https://pepy.tech/project/diviner    :alt: Total DownloadsIs this right for my project?-----------------------------Diviner is meant to help with large-scale forecasting. Instead of describing each individual use case where it may beapplicable, here is a non-exhaustive list of projects that it would fit well as a solution for:* Forecasting regional sales within each country that a company does business in per day* Predicting inventory demand at regional warehouses for thousands of products* Forecasting traveler counts at each airport within a country daily* Predicting electrical demand per neighborhood (or household) in a multi-state regionEach of these examples has a *common theme*:* The data is temporally homogenous (all of the data is collected daily, hourly, weekly, etc.).* There is a large number of individual models that need to be built due to the cardinality of the data.* There is no guarantee of seasonal, trend, or residual homogeneity in each series.* Varying levels of aggregation may be called for to solve different use cases.The primary problem that Diviner solves is managing the execution of many discrete time-series modeling tasks. Divinerprovides a high-level API and metadata management approach that relieves the operational burden of managing hundredsor thousands of individual models.Grouped Modeling Wrappers-------------------------Currently, Diviner supports the following open source libraries for forecasting at scale:* `prophet &lt;https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html&gt;`_* `pmdarima &lt;http://alkaline-ml.com/pmdarima/&gt;`_Installing----------Install Diviner from PyPI via:``pip install diviner``Documentation-------------Documentation, Examples, and Tutorials for Diviner can be found`here &lt;https://databricks-diviner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html&gt;`_.Community &amp; Contributing------------------------For assistance with Diviner, see the `docs &lt;https://databricks-diviner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html&gt;`_.Contributions to Diviner are welcome.
