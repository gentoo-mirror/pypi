This package gives you the ability to do the same, with or without talent.Currently it can only generate arts using minecraft, the cells of a spreadsheet, ascii characters, or rubik's cubes, but if you have any ideas that fit into the project's goal please [let me know](https://github.com/Eric-Mendes/unexpected-isaves/issues/10), or - even better - submit a merge request with your work!## Table of contents- [What does this package do :thinking:](https://github.com/Eric-Mendes/unexpected-isaves#what-does-this-package-do-thinking);- [How to use it :computer:](https://github.com/Eric-Mendes/unexpected-isaves#how-to-use-it-computer);- [Why unexpected-isaves?](https://github.com/Eric-Mendes/unexpected-isaves#why-unexpected-isaves);- [Contributing :pencil:](https://github.com/Eric-Mendes/unexpected-isaves#contributing-pencil);- [Into the wild](https://github.com/Eric-Mendes/unexpected-isaves#into-the-wild)&lt;hr/&gt;## What does this package do :thinking:With this package you can save any `image` on a given `path` as a- Spreadsheet:![this_is_fine-meme-python-excel-spreadsheet-unexpected-isaves](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42689328/159305173-7946f75e-999d-479d-8ac6-cd09e89097c0.png)- Minecraft Pixel Art Datapack:![naruto-anime-python-minecraft-pixel-art-data-pack-unexpected-isaves](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42689328/159305299-12f8086d-0ef4-4e7a-9960-29ad777f8a7f.png)- Ascii Art:![capybara-python-ascii-art-unexpected-isaves](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42689328/216817867-b2f30809-6ae8-46f3-87d2-6c8f95a0a761.png)- Rubik's Cube:![apple-python-rubiks-cube-art-unexpected-isaves](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42689328/222265597-44f4543e-6af8-4644-8b69-489b1723a837.png)## How to use it :computer:First you install it in your environment like this```bashpip install unexpected-isaves```Then you can start using it already! Pass the path of any image you've got locally and try to save it using our functions!```pythonfrom unexpected_isaves import save_imagesave_image.to_excel(    image=&quot;my_image.png&quot;,    path=&quot;/home/user/Documents/my_image.xlsx&quot;)```## Why unexpected-isaves?You might be wondering: why would I ever need such a useless lib? The answer is: you wouldn't. This lib was created for learning purposes, and it was never my intention to make it useful. It might be a nice way to impress your friends on your Minecraft server, or to make an important presentation lighter with a fun spreadsheet art, though. Be creative!You can read our [wiki](https://github.com/Eric-Mendes/unexpected-isaves/wiki) for more information about this project if you want.## Contributing :pencil:Just like Minecraft, everything's better when shared and built together.Contributions are welcome and appreciated.
