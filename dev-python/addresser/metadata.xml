	<longdescription>Addresser=========Addresser parses and normalizes street addresses and intersections. It is a port of the Node package,`parse-address &lt;https://github.com/hassansin/parse-address&gt;`_, which in turn is a port of the PERL package,`Geo::StreetAddress::US &lt;http://search.cpan.org/~timb/Geo-StreetAddress-US-1.04/US.pm&gt;`_.From the `Geo::StreetAddress::US` description:    Geo::StreetAddress::US is a regex-based street address and street intersection parser for the United States. Its    basic goal is to be as forgiving as possible when parsing user-provided address strings. Geo::StreetAddress::US knows    about directional prefixes and suffixes, fractional building numbers, building units, grid-based addresses (such as    those used in parts of Utah), 5 and 9 digit ZIP codes, and all of the official USPS abbreviations for street types    and state names...Install-------Addresser can be installed from pip:.. code-block:: text    $ pip install addresserUsage-----.. code-block:: python    from addresser import parse_location    parse_location('1005 N Gravenstein Highway Sebastopol CA 95472')**Result**.. code-block:: python    {        'number': '1005',        'prefix': 'N',        'street': 'Gravenstein',        'type': 'Hwy',        'city': 'Sebastopol',        'state': 'CA',        'zip': '95472'    }</longdescription>
