We might make exceptions from this in case of security fixes for vulnerabilities that are severe enough.The current major version is 2.x.y. Development for 2.x.y occurs on the `main` branch. 2.x.y mainly differs from 1.x.y by dropping support for Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8, and by dropping support for older Ansible/ansible-base/ansible-core versions. See the changelog for details. 1.x.y is still developed on the `stable-1` branch, but only security fixes, major bugfixes, and other absolutely necessary changes will be backported.We explicitly exclude code compatibility. **antsibull-docs is not supposed to be used as a library.** The only exception are potential dependencies with other antsibull projects (currently there are none). If you want to use a certain part of antsibull-docs as a library, please create an issue so we can discuss whether we add a stable interface for **parts** of the Python code. We do not promise that this will actually happen though.If you are interested in library support for interpreting Ansible markup, please take a look at [the antsibull-docs-parser project](https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs-parser).## Using the Sphinx extensionInclude it in your Sphinx configuration ``conf.py``::```# Add it to 'extensions':extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.intersphinx', 'notfound.extension', 'sphinx_antsibull_ext']```## Updating the CSS file for the Sphinx extensionThe CSS file [sphinx_antsibull_ext/antsibull-minimal.css](https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/blob/main/sphinx_antsibull_ext/antsibull-minimal.css) is built from [sphinx_antsibull_ext/css/antsibull-minimal.scss](https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs/blob/main/sphinx_antsibull_ext/src/antsibull-minimal.scss) using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [postcss](https://postcss.org/) using [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/).Use the script `build.sh` in `sphinx_antsibull_ext/css/` to build the `.css` file from the `.scss` file:```cd sphinx_antsibull_ext/css/./build-css.sh```For this to work, you need to make sure that `sassc` and `postcss` are on your path and that the autoprefixer and nanocss modules are installed:```# Debian:apt-get install sassc# PostCSS, autoprefixer and cssnano require nodejs/npm:npm install -g autoprefixer cssnano postcss postcss-cli```## DevelopmentInstall and run `nox` to run all tests. That's it for simple contributions!`nox` will create virtual environments in `.nox` inside the checked out projectand install the requirements needed to run the tests there.---antsibull-docs depends on the sister antsibull-core and antsibull-docs-parser projects.By default, `nox` will install a development version of these projects fromGithub.If you're hacking on antsibull-core and/or antsibull-docs-parser alongside antsibull-docs,nox will automatically install the projects from `../antsibull-core` and`../antsibull-docs-parser` when running tests if those paths exist.You can change this behavior through the `OTHER_ANTSIBULL_MODE` env var:- `OTHER_ANTSIBULL_MODE=auto` — the default behavior described above- `OTHER_ANTSIBULL_MODE=local` — install the projects from `../antsibull-core`  and `../antsibull-docs-parser`. Fail if those paths don't exist.- `OTHER_ANTSIBULL_MODE=git` — install the projects from the Github main branch- `OTHER_ANTSIBULL_MODE=pypi` — install the latest versions from PyPITo run specific tests:1. `nox -e test` to only run unit tests;2. `nox -e lint` to run all linters and formatter;3. `nox -e codeqa` to run `flake8`, `pylint`, `reuse lint`, and `antsibull-changelog lint`;4. `nox -e formatters` to run `isort` and `black`;5. `nox -e typing` to run `mypy` and `pyre`.To create a more complete local development env:``` consolegit clone https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-core.gitgit clone https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs-parser.gitgit clone https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docs.gitcd antsibull-docspython3 -m venv venv. ./venv/bin/activatepip install -e '.[dev]' -e ../antsibull-core -e ../antsibull-docs-parser[...]nox```## Creating a new release:1. Run `nox -e bump -- &lt;version&gt; &lt;release_summary_message&gt;`. This:   * Bumps the package version in `pyproject.toml`.   * Creates `changelogs/fragments/&lt;version&gt;.yml` with a `release_summary` section.   * Runs `antsibull-changelog release` and adds the changed files to git.   * Commits with message `Release &lt;version&gt;.` and runs `git tag -a -m 'antsibull-docs &lt;version&gt;' &lt;version&gt;`.   * Runs `hatch build --clean`.2. Run `git push` to the appropriate remotes.3. Once CI passes on GitHub, run `nox -e publish`. This:   * Runs `hatch publish`;   * Bumps the version to `&lt;version&gt;.post0`;   * Adds the changed file to git and run `git commit -m 'Post-release version bump.'`;4. Run `git push --follow-tags` to the appropriate remotes and create a GitHub release.</longdescription>
