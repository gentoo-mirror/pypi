	<longdescription>|Build Status|Albatross=========A modern, fast, simple, natively-async web framework. (Python3.5 only).. code:: python    from albatross import Server    import asyncio    class Handler:        async def on_get(self, req, res):            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)            res.write('Hello, %s' % req.args['name'])    app = Server()    app.add_route('/{name})', Handler())    app.serve()Notes for Usage~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~For now (pre 1.0.0), I'm making no claims about API stability (but willtry to avoid changes). That said, I'm using this framework for somesmall projects, and it is a joy to work in! Reach out if you want to usethis, as I'm happy to incorporate your feedback!Install-------::    pip3 install albatross3Features---------  You can read the entire codebase in about 30 minutes.-  It's natively async. Doing ``await`` database calls or controller   calls in your views just works!-  This works with the ``uvloop`` project, to make your server fast!Benchmarks-----------  My benchmarks indicate that albatross is as fast as aiohttp, both of   which are twice as fast as tornado. You can run the benchmarks by   poking around in the ``bench/`` folder... |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/kespindler/albatross.svg?branch=master   :target: https://travis-ci.org/kespindler/albatross</longdescription>
