	<longdescription>This package is a part of [Momotor](https://momotor.org/), a tool for automated processing of digital content. Momotor accepts digital content as a product bundle and generates a result bundle from this product under control of a recipe bundle. Momotor is like a continuous integration system, but broader in scope. The type of content that Momotor can process is not restricted; each recipe may impose its own constraints. One application of Momotor in an educational setting is the automatic generation of feedback on work submitted for programming assignments.---The `momotor-engine-options` package provides methods to process options in Momotor recipe and configurationbundles. It also includes the handlers for options in the &quot;scheduler&quot; and &quot;tools&quot; domains.</longdescription>
