	<longdescription># arraylib-solve# Introduction`arraylib-solve` is a tool to deconvolve combinatorially pooled arrayed random mutagenesis libraries (e.g. by transposon mutagenesis). In a typical experiment generating arrayed mutagenesis libraries, first a pooled version of the library is created and arrayed on a grid of well plates. To infer the identities of each mutant on the well plate, wells are pooled in combinatorial manner such that each mutant appears in a unique combination of pools. The pools are then sequenced using NGS and sequenced reads are stored in individual fastq files per pool. `arraylib-solve` deconvolves the pools and returns summaries stating the identity and location of each mutant on the original well grid. The package is based on the approach described in [[1]](#1).# InstallationTo install `arraylib` first create `Python 3.8` environment e.g. by```conda create --name arraylib-env python=3.8conda activate arraylib-env```and install the package using ```pip install arraylib-solve````arraylib-solve` uses bowtie2 [[2]](#2) to align reads to the reference genome. Please ensure that bowtie2 is installed in your environment by running:```conda install -c bioconda bowtie2```# How to run `arraylib`A detailed manual how to run `arraylib` interactively and from the command line can be found here https://tcapraz.github.io/arraylib/index.html.# References&lt;a id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; Baym, M., Shaket, L., Anzai, I.A., Adesina, O. and Barstow, B., 2016.
