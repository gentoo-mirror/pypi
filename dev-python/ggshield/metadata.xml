To do so, use the `ggshield auth login` command. This command automates the provisioning of a personal access token and its configuration on the local workstation.You can learn more about it from [`ggshield auth login` documentation](https://docs.gitguardian.com/internal-repositories-monitoring/ggshield/reference/auth/login).Alternatively, you can create your personal access token manually and you can store it in the `GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY` environment variable to complete the setup.# Getting startedYou can now use `ggshield` to search for secrets:- in files: `ggshield secret scan path -r .`- in repositories: `ggshield secret scan repo .`- in Docker images: `ggshield secret scan docker ubuntu:22.04`- in Pypi packages: `ggshield secret scan pypi flask`- and more, have a look at `ggshield secret scan --help` output for details.You can also search for vulnerabilities in your IaC files using the following command:```ggshield iac scan .```# IntegrationsYou can integrate `ggshield` in your [CI/CD workflow](https://docs.gitguardian.com/ggshield-docs/integrations/overview#cicd-integrations-secrets-detection-in-your-cicd-workflow).To catch errors earlier, use `ggshield` as a [pre-commit, pre-push or pre-receive Git hook](https://docs.gitguardian.com/ggshield-docs/integrations/overview#git-hooks-prevent-secrets-from-reaching-your-vcs).# Learn moreFor more information, have a look at [the documentation](https://docs.gitguardian.com/ggshield-docs/getting-started)# OutputIf no secrets or policy breaks have been found, the exit code will be 0:```bash$ ggshield secret scan pre-commit```If a secret or other issue is found in your staged code or in your CI, you will have an alert giving you the type of policy break, the filename where the policy break has been found and a patch giving you the position of the policy break in the file:```shell$ ggshield secret scan pre-commitüõ°Ô∏è  ‚öîÔ∏è  üõ°Ô∏è  2 policy breaks have been found in file production.rb11 | config.paperclip_defaults = {12 |     :s3_credentials =&gt; {13 |     :bucket =&gt; &quot;XXX&quot;,14 |     :access_key_id =&gt; &quot;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&quot;,                            |_____AWS Keys_____|15 |     :secret_access_key =&gt; &quot;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&quot;                                |_______________AWS Keys_______________|16 |     }17 | }```Lines that are too long are truncated to match the size of the terminal, unless the verbose mode is used (`-v` or `--verbose`).# Related open source projects- [truffleHog](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog)- [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks)- [gitrob](https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob)- [git-hound](https://github.com/tillson/git-hound)- [AWS git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets)- [detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets)# License`ggshield` is MIT licensed.</longdescription>
