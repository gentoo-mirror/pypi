(optional) `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true` 4. `poetry install`5. `poetry run pywidevine --help`As seen in Step 5, running the `pywidevine` executable is somewhat different to a normal PIP installation.See [Poetry's Docs] on various ways of making calls under the virtual-environment.  [Python]: &lt;https://python.org&gt;  [Poetry]: &lt;https://python-poetry.org&gt;  [Poetry's Docs]: &lt;https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#using-your-virtual-environment&gt;## UsageThe following is a minimal example of using pywidevine in a script. It gets a License for Bitmovin'sArt of Motion Demo. There's various stuff not shown in this specific example like:- Privacy Mode- Setting Service Certificates- Remote CDMs and Serving- Choosing a License Type to request- Creating WVD files- and much more!Just take a look around the Cdm code to see what stuff does. Everything is documented quite well.There's also various functions in `main.py` that showcases a lot of features.```pyfrom pywidevine.cdm import Cdmfrom pywidevine.device import Devicefrom pywidevine.pssh import PSSHimport requests# prepare psshpssh = PSSH(&quot;AAAAW3Bzc2gAAAAA7e+LqXnWSs6jyCfc1R0h7QAAADsIARIQ62dqu8s0Xpa&quot;            &quot;7z2FmMPGj2hoNd2lkZXZpbmVfdGVzdCIQZmtqM2xqYVNkZmFsa3IzaioCSEQyAA==&quot;)# load devicedevice = Device.load(&quot;C:/Path/To/A/Provision.wvd&quot;)# load cdmcdm = Cdm.from_device(device)# open cdm sessionsession_id = cdm.open()# get license challengechallenge = cdm.get_license_challenge(session_id, pssh)# send license challenge (assuming a generic license server SDK with no API front)licence = requests.post(&quot;https://...&quot;, data=challenge)licence.raise_for_status()# parse license challengecdm.parse_license(session_id, licence.content)# print keysfor key in cdm.get_keys(session_id):    print(f&quot;[{key.type}] {key.kid.hex}:{key.key.hex()}&quot;)# close session, disposes of session datacdm.close(session_id)```## Troubleshooting### Executable `pywidevine` was not foundMake sure the Python installation's Scripts directory is added to your Path Environment Variable.If this happened under a Poetry environment, make sure you use the appropriate Poetry-specific way of callingthe executable. You may make this executable available globally by adding the .venv's Scripts folder to yourPath Environment Variable.## Disclaimer1. This project requires a valid Google-provisioned Private Key and Client Identification blob which are not   provided by this project.2. Public test provisions are available and provided by Google to use for testing projects such as this one.3. License Servers have the ability to block requests from any provision, and are likely already blocking test   provisions on production endpoints.4. This project does not condone piracy or any action against the terms of the DRM systems.5. All efforts in this project have been the result of Reverse-Engineering, Publicly available research, and Trial   &amp; Error.## Key and Output Security*Licenses, Content Keys, and Decrypted Data is not secure in this CDM implementation.*The Content Decryption Module is meant to do all downloading, decrypting, and decoding of content, not just licenseacquisition. This Python implementation only does License Acquisition within the CDM.The section of which a 'Decrypt Frame' call is made would be more of a 'Decrypt File' in this implementation. Justreturning the original file in plain text defeats the point of the DRM. Even if 'Decrypt File' was somehow secure, theContent Keys used to decrypt the files are already exposed to the caller anyway, allowing them to manually decrypt.An attack on a 'Decrypt Frame' system would be analogous to doing an HDMI capture or similar attack. This is because itwould require re-encoding the video by splicing each individual frame with the right frame-rate, syncing to audio, andmore.While a 'Decrypt Video' system would be analogous to downloading a Video and passing it through a script. Not much ofan attack if at all. The only protection against a system like this would be monitoring the provision and acquisitionsof licenses and prevent them. This can be done by revoking the device provision, or the user or their authorization tothe service.There isn't any immediate way to secure either Key or Decrypted information within a Python environment that is notHardware backed. Even if obfuscation or some other form of Security by Obscurity was used, this is a Software-basedContent Protection Module (in Python no less) with no hardware backed security. It would be incredibly trivial to breakany sort of protection against retrieving the original video data.Though, it's not impossible. Google's Chrome Browser CDM is a simple library extension file programmed in C++ that hasbeen improving its security using math and obscurity for years. It's getting harder and harder to break with its latestversions only being beaten by Brute-force style methods. However, they have a huge team of very skilled workers, andmaking a CDM in C++ has immediate security benefits and a lot of methods to obscure and obfuscate the code.## Credit- Widevine Icon &amp;copy; Google.- The awesome community for their shared research and insight into the Widevine Protocol and Key Derivation.## License[GNU General Public License, Version 3.0](LICENSE)</longdescription>
