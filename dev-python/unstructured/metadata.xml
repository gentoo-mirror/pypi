The use cases of `unstructured` revolve around streamlining and optimizing the data processing workflow for LLMs. `unstructured` modular bricks and connectors form a cohesive system that simplifies data ingestion and pre-processing, making it adaptable to different platforms and efficient in transforming unstructured data into structured outputs.&lt;h3 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;p&gt;API Announcement!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;We are thrilled to announce our newly launched [Unstructured API](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/api.html), providing the Unstructured capabilities from `unstructured` as an API. Check out the [`unstructured-api` GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-api) to start making API calls. You’ll also find instructions about how to host your own API version.While access to the hosted Unstructured API will remain free, API Keys are required to make requests. To prevent disruption, get yours [here](https://unstructured.io/#get-api-key) and start using it today! Check out the [`unstructured-api` README](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-api#--) to start making API calls.&lt;/p&gt;#### :rocket: Beta Feature: Chipper ModelWe are releasing the beta version of our Chipper model to deliver superior performance when processing high-resolution, complex documents. To start using the Chipper model in your API request, you can utilize the `hi_res_model_name=chipper` parameter. Please refer to the documentation [here](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/api.html#beta-version-hi-res-strategy-with-chipper-model).As the Chipper model is in beta version, we welcome feedback and suggestions. For those interested in testing the Chipper model, we encourage you to connect with us on [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/unstructuredw-kbe4326/shared_invite/zt-20kd2e9ti-q5yz7RCa2nlyqmAba9vqRw).## :eight_pointed_black_star: Quick StartThere are several ways to use the `unstructured` library:* [Run the library in a container](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured#using-the-library-in-a-container) or* Install the library    1. [Install from PyPI](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured#installing-the-library)    2. [Install for local development](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured#installation-instructions-for-local-development)* For installation with `conda` on Windows system, please refer to the [documentation](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/installing.html#installation-with-conda-on-windows)### Run the library in a containerThe following instructions are intended to help you get up and running using Docker to interact with `unstructured`.See [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you don't already have docker installed on your machine.NOTE: we build multi-platform images to support both x86_64 and Apple silicon hardware. `docker pull` should download the corresponding image for your architecture, but you can specify with `--platform` (e.g. `--platform linux/amd64`) if needed.We build Docker images for all pushes to `main`. We tag each image with the corresponding short commit hash (e.g. `fbc7a69`) and the application version (e.g. `0.5.5-dev1`). We also tag the most recent image with `latest`. To leverage this, `docker pull` from our image repository.```bashdocker pull downloads.unstructured.io/unstructured-io/unstructured:latest```Once pulled, you can create a container from this image and shell to it.```bash# create the containerdocker run -dt --name unstructured downloads.unstructured.io/unstructured-io/unstructured:latest# this will drop you into a bash shell where the Docker image is runningdocker exec -it unstructured bash```You can also build your own Docker image.If you only plan on parsing one type of data you can speed up building the image by commenting out someof the packages/requirements necessary for other data types. See Dockerfile to know which lines are necessaryfor your use case.```bashmake docker-build# this will drop you into a bash shell where the Docker image is runningmake docker-start-bash```Once in the running container, you can try things directly in Python interpreter's interactive mode.```bash# this will drop you into a python console so you can run the below partition functionspython3&gt;&gt;&gt; from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf&gt;&gt;&gt; elements = partition_pdf(filename=&quot;example-docs/layout-parser-paper-fast.pdf&quot;)&gt;&gt;&gt; from unstructured.partition.text import partition_text&gt;&gt;&gt; elements = partition_text(filename=&quot;example-docs/fake-text.txt&quot;)```### Installing the libraryUse the following instructions to get up and running with `unstructured` and test yourinstallation.- Install the Python SDK to support all document types with `pip install &quot;unstructured[all-docs]&quot;`  - For plain text files, HTML, XML, JSON and Emails that do not require any extra dependencies, you can run `pip install unstructured`  - To process other doc types, you can install the extras required for those documents, such as `pip install &quot;unstructured[docx,pptx]&quot;`- Install the following system dependencies if they are not already available on your system.  Depending on what document types you're parsing, you may not need all of these.    - `libmagic-dev` (filetype detection)    - `poppler-utils` (images and PDFs)    - `tesseract-ocr` (images and PDFs, install `tesseract-lang` for additional language support)    - `libreoffice` (MS Office docs)    - `pandoc` (EPUBs, RTFs and Open Office docs)- For suggestions on how to install on the Windows and to learn about dependencies for other features, see the  installation documentation [here](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/installing.html).At this point, you should be able to run the following code:```pythonfrom unstructured.partition.auto import partitionelements = partition(filename=&quot;example-docs/eml/fake-email.eml&quot;)print(&quot;\n\n&quot;.join([str(el) for el in elements]))```### Installation Instructions for Local DevelopmentThe following instructions are intended to help you get up and running with `unstructured`locally if you are planning to contribute to the project.* Using `pyenv` to manage virtualenv's is recommended but not necessary* Mac install instructions. See [here](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/community#mac--homebrew) for more detailed instructions.* `brew install pyenv-virtualenv`  * `pyenv install 3.10`  * Linux instructions are available [here](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/community#linux).* Create a virtualenv to work in and activate it, e.g. for one named `unstructured`:`pyenv  virtualenv 3.10 unstructured` &lt;br /&gt;`pyenv activate unstructured`* Run `make install`* Optional:  * To install models and dependencies for processing images and PDFs locally, run `make install-local-inference`.  * For processing image files, `tesseract` is required. See [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html) for installation instructions.  * For processing PDF files, `tesseract` and `poppler` are required. The [pdf2image docs](https://pdf2image.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) have instructions on installing `poppler` across various platforms.Additionally, if you're planning to contribute to `unstructured`, we provide you an optional `pre-commit` configurationfile to ensure your code matches the formatting and linting standards used in `unstructured`.If you'd prefer not to have code changes auto-tidied before every commit, you can use  `make check` to seewhether any linting or formatting changes should be applied, and `make tidy` to apply them.If using the optional `pre-commit`, you'll just need to install the hooks with `pre-commit install` since the`pre-commit` package is installed as part of `make install` mentioned above. Finally, if you decided to use `pre-commit`you can also uninstall the hooks with `pre-commit uninstall`.In addition to develop in your local OS we also provide a helper to use docker providing a development environment:```bashmake docker-start-dev```This starts a docker container with your local repo mounted to `/mnt/local_unstructured`. This docker image allows you to develop without worrying about your OS's compatibility with the repo and its dependencies.## :clap: Quick Tour### DocumentationThis README overviews how to install, use and develop the library. For more comprehensive documentation, visit https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/ .### Concepts Guide**Bricks** 🧱 in `unstructured` are the foundational elements that drive the data processing workflow within the system. These components provide users with the building blocks to build pipelines targeted at the documents they care about. The bricks fall into three categories:- :jigsaw: *Partitioning* bricks break raw documents into standard, structured elements.- :broom: *Cleaning* bricks remove unwanted text from documents, such as boilerplate and sentence fragments.- :performing_arts: *Staging* bricks format data for downstream tasks, such as ML inference and data labeling.These bricks create a cohesive, streamlined process that enables effective data handling and analysis. Check out the available bricks and how to use them from the [Bricks documentation](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/bricks.html).The **Connectors** 🔗 in `unstructured` serve as vital links between the pre-processing pipeline and various data storage platforms. They allow for the batch processing of documents across various sources, including cloud services, repositories, and local directories. Each connector is tailored to a specific platform, such as Azure, Google Drive, or Github, and comes with unique commands and dependencies. To see the list of Connectors available in `unstructured` library, please check out the [Connectors GitHub folder](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/tree/main/unstructured/ingest/connector) and [documentation](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/connectors.html)### PDF Document Parsing ExampleThe following examples show how to get started with the `unstructured` library. You can parse over a dozen document types with one line of code! Use this [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1U8VCjY2-x8c6y5TYMbSFtQGlQVFHCVIW) to run the example below.The easiest way to parse a document in unstructured is to use the `partition` brick. If you use `partition` brick, `unstructured` will detect the file type and route it to the appropriate file-specific partitioning brick. If you are using the `partition` brick, you may need to install additional parameters via `pip install unstructured[local-inference]`. Ensure you first install `libmagic` using the instructions outlined [here](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/installing.html#filetype-detection) `partition` will always apply the default arguments. If you need advanced features, use a document-specific brick.```pythonfrom unstructured.partition.auto import partitionelements = partition(&quot;example-docs/layout-parser-paper.pdf&quot;)```Run `print(&quot;\n\n&quot;.join([str(el) for el in elements]))` to get a string representation of theoutput, which looks like:```LayoutParser : A Uniﬁed Toolkit for Deep Learning Based Document Image AnalysisZejiang Shen 1 ( (cid:0) ), Ruochen Zhang 2 , Melissa Dell 3 , Benjamin Charles Germain Lee 4 , Jacob Carlson 3 , andWeining Li 5Abstract. Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neuralnetworks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation.However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easyreuse of important innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been ongoing eﬀorts to improve reusability andsimplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, noneof them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIAis central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paperintroduces LayoutParser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applications.The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL modelsfor layout detection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility,LayoutParser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digitizationpipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines inreal-word use cases. The library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.ioKeywords: Document Image Analysis · Deep Learning · Layout Analysis · Character Recognition · Open Source library ·Toolkit.IntroductionDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of document image analysis (DIA) tasksincluding document image classiﬁcation [11,```See the [partitioning](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/bricks.html#partitioning)section in our documentation for a full list of options and instructions on how to usefile-specific partitioning functions.## :guardsman: Security PolicySee our [security policy](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/security/policy) forinformation on how to report security vulnerabilities.## :bug: Reporting BugsEncountered a bug?
