	<longdescription>Certifi: Python SSL Certificates================================Certifi provides Mozilla's carefully curated collection of Root Certificates forvalidating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identityof TLS hosts. It has been extracted from the `Requests`_ project.Installation------------``certifi`` is available on PyPI. Simply install it with ``pip``::    $ pip install certifiUsage-----To reference the installed certificate authority (CA) bundle, you can use thebuilt-in function::    &gt;&gt;&gt; import certifi    &gt;&gt;&gt; certifi.where()    '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem'Or from the command line::    $ python -m certifi    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pemEnjoy!1024-bit Root Certificates~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Browsers and certificate authorities have concluded that 1024-bit keys areunacceptably weak for certificates, particularly root certificates. For thisreason, Mozilla has removed any weak (i.e. 1024-bit key) certificate from itsbundle, replacing it with an equivalent strong (i.e. 2048-bit or greater key)certificate from the same CA. Because Mozilla removed these certificates fromits bundle, ``certifi`` removed them as well.In previous versions, ``certifi`` provided the ``certifi.old_where()`` functionto intentionally re-add the 1024-bit roots back into your bundle. This was notrecommended in production and therefore was removed at the end of 2018... _`Requests`: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/Addition/Removal of Certificates--------------------------------Certifi does not support any addition/removal or other modification of theCA trust store content. This project is intended to provide a reliable andhighly portable root of trust to python deployments. Look to upstream projectsfor methods to use alternate trust.</longdescription>
