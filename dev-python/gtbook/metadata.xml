	<longdescription># gtbook&gt; An &lt;a href='https://nbdev.fast.ai/'&gt;nbdev&lt;/a&gt; powered toolbox for Frank and Seth's robotics book.## How to useIn the book chapters, we should have a cell that fetches the latest version using pip:```bash%pip install -q -U gtbook```The above automatically installs other libraries on colab, e.g., gtsam and plotly.You also need a cell that imports what you need in a particular section, for example:```pythonfrom gtbook.display import showfrom gtbook.discrete import Variables```Further usage examples of these and more functions are given in the module documentation itself.There are also some command line tools defined in the `cli` module.## Notes for development&gt; Mostly for Frank as he adds to the library.- Conda install nbdev- show preview using `nbdev_preview`- `pip install -e .` for local install for test purposes.- `nbdev_prepare` to prepare for git commitTo release a new version:- nbdev_bump_version- make releaseProblems with nbdev2:- Somehow still wants to build the website in &quot;docs&quot;- &quot;fixes&quot; the notebooks in test, making cli test fail (commented out now). I committed them as I don't know how to prevent this. Correct files are at tag &quot;nbdev1&quot;Problems with circular dependency and issue [#3](https://github.com/gtbook/gtbook/issues/3), January 2023:- By adding the pybind stl header again in inference.h the typeError went away- building the wrapper in 3.8 leads to a circular dependency, however.- I created a version 4.2a9 to stabilize, and created a PR on gtsam-manylinux-build to build it. It builds and wheels were built for linux and mac-86.- I built 3 wheels for M1 with gtsam-build-m1.- uploaded all with twine, at https://pypi.org/project/gtsam/4.2a9/- changed dependence to 4.2a9- nbdev_prepare and nbdev_pypi</longdescription>
