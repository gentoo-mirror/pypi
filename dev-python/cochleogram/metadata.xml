	<longdescription>Cochleogram ===========Introduction------------This facilitates creating cochleograms from confocal images and will exporta frequency map and inner/outer hair cell positions along the tonotopic axis.If position information is stored in the file, it can be used to automaticallyalign multiple confocal z-stacks for a single piece. Datasets--------Right now only Leica LIF files are supported. At one time we had support forthe Zeiss CZI format but it needs to be updated to work with the currentversion of the program.Naming conventions for LIF files................................Files should be named with the identifier (e.g., animal ID and ear) followedbyt the label for each channel in the order the channels were imaged. Forexample:    B009-8L-CtBP2-MyosinVIIa-PMTInside each file, the pieces must be numbered sequentially from base (hook) toapex. If more htan one image is required for a piece, use letters for thesuffixes (i.e., &quot;piece2a&quot;, &quot;piece2b&quot;, etc.). The order in which the images fora single piece are labeled does not matter since the program will automaticallyalign them based on the stage coordinates stored in the file.We currently do not have support for missing pieces. This will be added oncethe need arises.Using the program-----------------Mouse interaction.................left click    Select tileleft click + drag    Pan imagemouse wheel    Zoom in/outKeyboard shortcuts..................t    Switch to tile modei    Switch to IHC mode1    Switch to OHC1 mode2    Switch to OHC2 mode3    Switch to OHC4 mode4    Switch to extra modes    Select spiral toole    Select exclude toolc    Select cell tooln    Select next tile (tile mode only)p    Select previous tile (tile mode only)arrow keys    The behavior of the arrow keys will depend on whether tile mode is    selected. If tile mode is selected, then the arrow keys will move the tile.    If any other mode is selected, the arrow keys will pan the image (this can    be useful when in spiral or cell mode to move through the cochlea when    zoomed in). To move the tile (or pan the image) in smaller steps, hold down    shift at the same time.Analysis........Analysis requires the following steps:* Aligning the tiles so that they overlap as accurately as possible.* Tracing a spiral through each row of hair cells.* Marking individual hair cells.* Marking regions containing uninterpretable data.Tools are provided to facilitate each step. Be sure that you are satisfied withthe result of the current step before moving to the next step. Although you cango back and edit a previous step, it may affect your analysis (e.g., if youneed to move a tile after marking hair cells, you may have to manually edita large number of hair cells).**Tile mode**Start by selecting &quot;tiles&quot; from the edit buttons, then left-clicking to selectthe tile that is misaligned. Using the arrow keys, you can move the tile untilit is properly aligned with the other tiles. If you need to move the tile insmaller steps, hold down the shift key at the same time as the arrow keys. Itmay be helpful to toggle &quot;highlight selected&quot; so that you get a transparentoverlay. When in &quot;highlight selected&quot; mode, the currently selected tile will beshown with a red border.left click    Select tilemouse wheel    Zoom in/outarrow keys    Move currently selected tile (large steps)shift + arrow keys    Move currently selected tile (small steps)n    Select next tilep    Select previous tile**Spiral mode**Once you are satisfied with the alignment of the tiles, select &quot;IHC&quot; from theedit buttons and be sure the spiral tool to the right of the edit buttons areselected. The very first point you mark should be on the end of the row of haircells facing the most basal region of the cochlea. This point will behighlighted with a red circle. If you realize you made a mistake, you canselect a different point as the start of the spiral by control + right-clickingthat point when in spiral mode.You must select a minimum of four points to create the spiral. You can addpoints in between existing points and the spiral will be rerouted through thosepoints. The algorithm assumes that the &quot;next&quot; point in the path is the oneclosest to it (i.e., the order in which you add the points does notmatter).Repeat the process for OHC1, OHC2, and OHC3. Be sure that the spiral bisectsthe nuclei (IHCs) or cuticular plate (OHCs) as that will facilitate thesemi-automated algorithms implemented by the program to help mark hair cells.right click    Add pointshift + right click    Remove pointcontrol + right click    Set point as origin for spiral**Cell mode**After marking the spiral, run the algorithm to automatically detect cells. Youcan play with the settings (each time you run, it will delete the existingcells and create new ones). You will likely have to manually edit theautomatically-detected cells. Select the cell tool and then use right click toadd cells and shift + left click to delete cells.right click    Add cellshift + right click    Remove cellFrom time to time there will be a fourth row of OHCs. These should manually beidentified by selecting &quot;extra&quot; for the cell you would like to edit and thenadding the cells using the cell tool.  Since the fourth row tends to be veryshort in length, you cannot mark a spiral or mark the region as excluded.**Exclude mode**Finally, go back through each row of hair cells. If there was a region you feltyou could not intepret properly, select the exclude tool. Right-click thespiral at one end of the region then right-click again at the other end of theregion you wish to exclude.right click    Start region. Click again to end region.shift + right click    Remove region under mouse cursor.escape    Cancel current region.Some additional tools are made available to facilitate this process:* You can merge all excluded regions across the OHC spirals into a single set  of excluded regions that apply to all OHC spirals (`Combine OHC exclusions`  button).* You can simplify a set of excluded regions for a particular spiral if they  are overlapping (this will combine overlapping exclusion regions into  a single exclusion region) using the `Simplify exclusions` button.</longdescription>
