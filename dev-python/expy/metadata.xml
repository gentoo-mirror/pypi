	<longdescription># OverviewExpy is an simple-yet-powerful experiment framework builder for cognitive tasks. It's aimed at setting up an experiment without struggling with the manual production of stimuli, data loading and storing, or the other time-consuming works.**Highlights**:- Various stimuli modules (not need for preparation of massive stimuli pictures).- Various procedure-controlling modules (instruction, tip, rest-stage, etc.)- Convenient for stimuli loading and responses recording.- Convenient for getting participants' response data (from keyboard, mouse, or joystick).- Sending triggers easily.- Easy pause or exit from the program.**Limitation**:- Not good at drawing complex shape (e.g.,grating) as stimuli (however, you could draw them as loaded pictures).---## DocumentationSee http://expy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for introduction, tutorials, and reference manual.---# Installation instructionsExpy has been tested on Python3.X 64bit.(Current it might be unfit for older versions like Python2.7. But since Python2 will become obsolete in the years to come, why not drop it anyaway and take Python3 instead?)The simplest way to install Expy is through the Python Package Index (PyPI), which ensures that all required dependencies are established. This can be achieved by executing the following command:```pip install expy```or:```sudo pip install expy```###*Required Dependencies*- numpy- pandas- scipy- pygame- pyaudio- wave- pyserial---# Simple example (An RSPV demo)```python# coding:utf-8from expy import * # Import the needed functionsstart() # Initiate the experiment environmentfor w in 'ABCDE12345':    drawText(w) # Draw something on the canvas(not the screen)    show(0.2) # Display current canvas on the screen, and keep for 0.2s```</longdescription>
