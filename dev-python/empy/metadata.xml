	<longdescription>EmPy is a system for embedding Python expressions and statements    in template text; it takes an EmPy source file, processes it, and    produces output.  This is accomplished via expansions, which are    special signals to the EmPy system and are set off by a special    prefix (by default the at sign, '@').  EmPy can expand arbitrary    Python expressions and statements in this way, as well as a    variety of special forms.  Textual data not explicitly delimited    in this way is sent unaffected to the output, allowing Python to    be used in effect as a markup language.  Also supported are &quot;hook&quot;    callbacks, recording and playback via diversions, and dynamic,    chainable filters.  The system is highly configurable via command    line options and embedded commands.</longdescription>
