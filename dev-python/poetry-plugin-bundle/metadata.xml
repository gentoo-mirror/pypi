	<longdescription># Poetry Plugin: BundleThis package is a plugin that allows the bundling of Poetry projects into various formats.## InstallationThe easiest way to install the `bundle` plugin is via the `self add` command of Poetry.```bashpoetry self add poetry-plugin-bundle```If you used `pipx` to install Poetry you can add the plugin via the `pipx inject` command.```bashpipx inject poetry poetry-plugin-bundle```Otherwise, if you used `pip` to install Poetry you can add the plugin packages via the `pip install` command.```bashpip install poetry-plugin-bundle```## UsageThe plugin introduces a `bundle` command namespace that regroups commands to bundle the current projectand its dependencies into various formats. These commands are particularly useful to deployPoetry-managed applications.### bundle venv### bundle venvThe `bundle venv` command bundles the project and its dependencies into a virtual environment.The following command```bashpoetry bundle venv /path/to/environment```will bundle the project in the `/path/to/environment` directory by creating the virtual environment,installing the dependencies and the current project inside it. If the directory does not exist,it will be created automatically.By default, the command uses the current Python executable to build the virtual environment.If you want to use a different one, you can specify it with the `--python/-p` option:```bashpoetry bundle venv /path/to/environment --python /full/path/to/pythonpoetry bundle venv /path/to/environment -p python3.8poetry bundle venv /path/to/environment -p 3.8```**Note**If the virtual environment already exists, two things can happen:- **The python version of the virtual environment is the same as the main one**: the dependencies will be synced (updated or removed).- **The python version of the virtual environment is different**: the virtual environment will be recreated from scratch.You can also ensure that the virtual environment is recreated by using the `--clear` option:```bashpoetry bundle venv /path/to/environment --clear```</longdescription>
