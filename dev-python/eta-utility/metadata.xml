	<longdescription>ETA Utility Functions======================While there are many tools which are useful in the area of energy optimized factory operations, at the`ETA-Fabrik &lt;https://www.ptw.tu-darmstadt.de&gt;`_ at Technical University of Darmstadt we have recognized a lack ofcomprehensive frameworks which combine functionality for optimization, simulation and communication withdevices in the factory.Therefore, we developed the *eta_utility* framework, which provides a standardized interface for the developmentof digital twins of factories or machines in a factory. The framework is based on the OpenAI gym environmentand follows a rolling horizon optimization approach. It provides standardized connectors for multiplecommunication protocols, including OPC UA and Modbus TCP. These facilities can be utilized to easily implementrolling horizon optimizations for factory systems and to directly control devices in the factory with theoptimization results.Full Documentation can be found on the`Documentation Page &lt;https://eta-utility.readthedocs.io/&gt;`_.You can find the `source code on github &lt;https://github.com/PTW-TUDa/eta_utility/&gt;`_. If you would like to contribute, please check our `working repository &lt;https://git.ptw.maschinenbau.tu-darmstadt.de/eta-fabrik/public/eta-utility/&gt;`_... warning::    This is beta software. APIs and functionality might change without prior notice. Please fix the version you    are using in your requirements to ensure your software will not be broken by changes in *eta_utility*... warning::    This version of *eta_utility* uses a deprecated version of *stable_baselines3* and OpenAI *gym*. It can only be installed    with specific versions of setuptools and pip!    .. code-block::console        python -m pip install setuptools==65.5 pip==21The package *eta_utility* consists of five main modules and some additional functionality:- *eta_x* is the rolling horizon optimization module which combines the functionality of the  other modules. It is based on the OpenAI *gym* framework and utilizes algorithms and functions  from the *stable_baselines3* package. *eta_x* also contains extended base classes for  environments and additional agents (or algorithms).- The *connectors* module provides a standardized way to connect to machines and devices in a  factory or other factory systems (such as energy management systems). The **connectors** can also  handle subscriptions, for example to regularly store values in a database.- The *servers* module can be used to easily instantiate servers, for example to publish optimization  results.- *simulators* are interfaces based on the *fmpy* package which provide a way to simulate FMU  (Functional Mockup Unit) models.  The  *simulators* can be used to perform quick complete simulations or to step through simulation  models, as would be the case in rolling horizons optimization.- *timeseries* is an interface based on the *pandas* package to load and manipulate timeseries data  from CSV files. It can for example rename columns, resample data in more complex ways such as  multiple different resampling intervals or select random time slices from data. The *scenario_from_csv* function combines much of this functionality.- Other functionality includes some general utilities which are available on the top level of the  package.Some particularities----------------------If you want to have logging output from eta utility, call:.. code-block::    from eta_utility import get_logger    get_logger()**eta_utility** uses dataframes to pass timeseries data and the dataframes are ensured tocontain timezone information where sensible.Citing this project--------------------Please cite this project using our publication:.. code-block::    Grosch, B., Ranzau, H., Dietrich, B., Kohne, T., Fuhrländer-Völker D., Sossenheimer, J., Lindner, M., Weigold, M.
