	<longdescription># Fact ExplorerWelcome to fact_explorer. You can find more extensive documentation over at [readthedocs](https://fact-explorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).This is a companion project to `factcast &lt;https://github.com/factcast/factcast&gt;`_ an event store written in Java.You can also check out other event sourcing related project in python over at `pyfactcast &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pyfactcast/&gt;`_as well as `cryptoshred &lt;https://pypi.org/project/cryptoshred/&gt;`_.This project arose mainly out of the necessity to work with events directly instead of through projections. This is useful to:- Enable searching for 'random' events quickly during debugging- Checking events during migrations- Many other things (you should probably not do if you are an event purist)Contributions are welcome. Just get in touch.## QuickstartSimply `pip install fact-exporter` and get going. The cli is available as `fact-exporter` andyou can run `fact-exporter --help` to get up to speed on what you can do.## DevelopmentThis project uses `poetry` for dependency management and `pre-commit` for local checks.## SponsorsThis project is sponsored by [PRISMA](https://www.prisma-capacity.eu/careers)</longdescription>
