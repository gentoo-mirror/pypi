Then it'svery likely that you get CSS selectors that you're no longer or neverusing.This tool can help you get started reducing all those selectors thatyou're not using.Whitespace compression?-----------------------No, that's a separate concern. This tool works independent of whitespacecompression/optimization.For example, if you have a build step or a runtime step that convertsall your CSS files into one (concatenation) and trims away all theexcess whitespace (compression) then the output CSS can still containselectors that are never actually used.What about AJAX?----------------If you have a script that creates DOM elements in some sort of``window.onload`` event then ``mincss`` will not be able to know thisbecause at the moment ``mincss`` is entirely static.So what is a web developer to do? Simple, use ``/* no mincss */`` likethis for example:::    .logged-in-info {        /* no mincss */        color: pink;    }That tells ``mincss`` to ignore the whole block and all its selectors.Ignore CSS----------By default, ``mincss`` will find all ``&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; ...`` and``&lt;style...&gt;`` tags and process them. If you have a link or an inlinetag that you don't want ``mincss`` to even notice, simply add this attributeto the tag:::    data-mincss=&quot;ignore&quot;Leave CSS as is---------------One technique to have a specific CSS selector be ignored by ``mincss`` is toput in a comment like ``/* no mincss */`` inside the CSS selectorsblock.Another way is to leave the whole stylesheet as is. The advantage of doingthis is if you have a ``link`` or ``style`` tag that you want ``mincss``to ignore but still find and include in the parsed result.</longdescription>
