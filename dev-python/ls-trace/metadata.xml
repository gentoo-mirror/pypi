	<longdescription># ls-trace-pyDatadog has generously announced the [donation][donation post] of their tracer librariesto the [OpenTelemety][opentelemetry docs] project. Auto-instrumentationis a core feature of these libraries, making it possible to create andcollect telemetry data without needing to change your code. LightStepwants you to be able to use these libraries now! We've forked the Datadoglibraries into the LightStep repo as agents. You can install and use these agents to take advantage ofauto-instrumentation without waiting for OpenTelemetry. Each LightStep agentis &quot;pinned&quot; to a Datadog release and is fully supported by LightStep'sCustomer Success team.Simply install the agent, configure it to communicate with LightStepSatellites, run your app, and then any [frameworks][framework docs], [data stores][datastore docs],and [libraries][libs] included in your app will send data to LightStep as distributed traces.[donation post]: https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/opentelemetry-instrumentation/[opentelemetry docs]: https://opentelemetry.io/[framework docs]: https://docs.lightstep.com/docs/python-auto-instrumentation#section-frameworks[datastore docs]: https://docs.lightstep.com/docs/python-auto-instrumentation#section-data-stores[libs]: https://docs.lightstep.com/docs/python-auto-instrumentation#section-libraries</longdescription>
