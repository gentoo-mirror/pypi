	<longdescription># Microsoft Azure SDK for PythonThis is the Microsoft Azure DNS Management Client Library.This package has been tested with Python 3.7+.For a more complete view of Azure libraries, see the [azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).## _Disclaimer__Azure SDK Python packages support for Python 2.7 has ended 01 January 2022. For more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_## Getting started### Prerequisites- Python 3.7+ is required to use this package.- [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)### Install the package```bashpip install azure-mgmt-dnspip install azure-identity```### AuthenticationBy default, [Azure Active Directory](https://aka.ms/awps/aad) token authentication depends on correct configure of following environment variables.- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` for Azure client ID.- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` for Azure tenant ID.- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` for Azure client secret.In addition, Azure subscription ID can be configured via environment variable `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.With above configuration, client can be authenticated by following code:```pythonfrom azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredentialfrom azure.mgmt.dns import DnsManagementClientimport ossub_id = os.getenv(&quot;AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID&quot;)client = DnsManagementClient(credential=DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id=sub_id)```## ExamplesCode samples for this package can be found at:- [Search DNS Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&amp;term=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing&amp;terms=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing) on docs.microsoft.com- [Azure Python Mgmt SDK Samples Repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)## Troubleshooting## Next steps## Provide FeedbackIf you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the[Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)section of the project. ![Impressions](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2Fazure-mgmt-dns%2FREADME.png)# Release History## 8.1.0 (2023-06-14)### Features Added  - Added operation group DnssecConfigsOperations  - Model RecordSet has a new parameter ds_records  - Model RecordSet has a new parameter naptr_records  - Model RecordSet has a new parameter tlsa_records  - Model Zone has a new parameter signing_keys  - Model Zone has a new parameter system_data## 8.1.0b1 (2023-02-10)### Other Changes  - Added generated samples in github repo  - Drop support for python&lt;3.7.0## 8.0.0 (2021-04-14) - GA release## 8.0.0b1 (2021-03-10)This is beta preview version.For detailed changelog please refer to equivalent stable version 10.2.0 (https://pypi.org/project/azure-mgmt-network/10.2.0/)This version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).**General breaking changes**- Credential system has been completly revamped:  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user  - For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)**General new features**- Type annotations support using `typing`. SDKs are mypy ready.- This client has now stable and official support for async. Check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.- This client now support natively tracing library like OpenCensus or OpenTelemetry. See this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.## 3.0.0 (2019-06-18)**General Breaking changes**This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*introduce breaking changes if you were importing from the v20xx_yy_zzAPI folders. In summary, some modules were incorrectlyvisible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed several issuescaused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in thefirst place.  - DnsManagementClient cannot be imported from    `azure.mgmt.dns.v20xx_yy_zz.dns_management_client` anymore    (import from `azure.mgmt.dns.v20xx_yy_zz` works like before)  - DnsManagementClientConfiguration import has been moved from    `azure.mgmt.dns.v20xx_yy_zz.dns_management_client` to    `azure.mgmt.dns.v20xx_yy_zz`  - A model `MyClass` from a &quot;models&quot; sub-module cannot be imported    anymore using `azure.mgmt.dns.v20xx_yy_zz.models.my_class`    (import from `azure.mgmt.dns.v20xx_yy_zz.models` works like    before)  - An operation class `MyClassOperations` from an `operations`    sub-module cannot be imported anymore using    `azure.mgmt.dns.v20xx_yy_zz.operations.my_class_operations`    (import from `azure.mgmt.dns.v20xx_yy_zz.operations` works like    before)Last but not least, HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default.You should always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), oruse no more than one client per process.## 2.1.0 (2018-09-10)**Features**  - Model RecordSet has a new parameter target_resource  - Added operation group DnsResourceReferenceOperations## 2.0.0 (2018-07-01)**Bugfixes**  - Fix ARM compliance (correct settings of location, tags, etc.)## 2.0.0rc2 (2018-07-05)**Features**  - Client class can be used as a context manager to keep the underlying    HTTP session open for performance**General Breaking changes**This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*introduce breaking changes.  - Model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. All    positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments. To    keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for    Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 uses the &quot;*&quot; syntax for    keyword-only arguments.  - Enum types now use the &quot;str&quot; mixin (class AzureEnum(str, Enum)) to    improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.    While this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important,    and are documented here:    &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others&gt; At a glance:      - &quot;is&quot; should not be used at all.      - &quot;format&quot; will return the string value, where &quot;%s&quot; string        formatting will return `NameOfEnum.stringvalue`. Format syntax        should be prefered.  - New Long Running Operation:      - Return type changes from        `msrestazure.azure_operation.AzureOperationPoller` to        `msrest.polling.LROPoller`. External API is the same.      - Return type is now **always** a `msrest.polling.LROPoller`,        regardless of the optional parameters used.      - The behavior has changed when using `raw=True`. Instead of        returning the initial call result as `ClientRawResponse`,        without polling, now this returns an LROPoller. After polling,        the final resource will be returned as a `ClientRawResponse`.      - New `polling` parameter. The default behavior is        `Polling=True` which will poll using ARM algorithm. When        `Polling=False`, the response of the initial call will be        returned without polling.      - `polling` parameter accepts instances of subclasses of        `msrest.polling.PollingMethod`.      - `add_done_callback` will no longer raise if called after        polling is finished, but will instead execute the callback right        away.**Bugfixes**  - Compatibility of the sdist with wheel 0.31.0## 2.0.0rc1 (2018-03-14)**Features**  - Add public/private zone  - Add record_sets.list_all_by_dns_zone operation  - Add zones.update operation**Breaking changes**  - 'zone_type' is now required when creating a zone ('Public' is    equivalent as previous behavior)New API version 2018-03-01-preview## 1.2.0 (2017-10-26)  - add record_type CAA  - remove pointless return type of deleteApi version moves from 2016-04-01 to 2017-09-01## 1.1.0 (2017-10-10)  - Add &quot;recordsetnamesuffix&quot; filter parameter to list operations## 1.0.1 (2017-04-20)This wheel package is now built with the azure wheel extension## 1.0.0 (2016-12-12)  - Initial release</longdescription>
