What is needed are formatters thatsupport more flexibility while still providing word wrapping.The ParagraphFormatter----------------------This module provides the **ParagraphFormatter** class. If this class is passedto the **argparse.ArgumentParser** creation call as the *formatter_class*argument, then help and epilog paragraphs, separated by single blank lines,will be preserved. Word wrapping will be performed within the paragraphs.Note that **ParagraphFormatter** is implemented by overriding two privatemethods in the default **argparse** formatter, and that the internals of thatclass are not considered part of the **argparse** API. There is therefore asmall risk that the code may break with a future standard library release. Themodule has been tested across all supported Python 3 versions.The FlexiFormatter------------------As it turns out, **ParagraphFormatter** is a more primitive version of a richformatter that has been [long proposed](https://bugs.python.org/issue12806)for inclusion in Python.This module provides that **FlexiFormatter** class, with some modifications.This formatter preserves line feeds and indentation, and understands bulletlists.FlexiFormatter has been submitted for inclusion in Python3.9 - [PR22129](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/22129).It would be good for this formatter to be merged - it eliminates theAPI-migration risk.Demo----The script[*demo.py*](https://github.com/davesteele/argparse_formatter/blob/master/demo.py)demonstrates the effect of using the ParagraphFormatter:    # ./demo.py    *************************    Using the Default formatter    *************************    usage: demo.py [-h] [--arg ARG]    optional arguments:      -h, --help  show this help message and exit      --arg ARG   This same feature would be useful for arguments that would                  benefit from more explanation. Wouldn't it?    This is a multi-paragraph epilog. It is presenting data that would benefit by    being visually broken up into pieces. It sure would be nice if it was    represented that way.    *************************    Using the Paragraph formatter    *************************    usage: demo.py [-h] [--arg ARG]    optional arguments:      -h, --help  show this help message and exit      --arg ARG   This same feature would be useful for arguments that would                  benefit from more explanation.

It sure would be nice if it was represented that way.The [*flexidemo.py*](https://github.com/davesteele/argparse_formatter/blob/master/flexidemo.py)script shows the output for **FlexiFormatter**    *************************    Using the Default formatter    *************************    usage: flexidemo.py [-h] [--arg ARG]    optional arguments:      -h, --help  show this help message and exit      --arg ARG   This same feature would be useful for arguments that would                  benefit from more explanation. 1. It looks nicer 2. It is easier                  to read, even if some of the bullets get to be a little long.    This is a multi-paragraph epilog. It is presenting data that would benefit by    being visually broken up into pieces. It sure would be nice if it was    represented that way. 1. This is a pretty long line, in a bullet list -    getting longer and longer and longer 2. this isn't    *************************    Using the Flexi formatter    *************************    usage: flexidemo.py [-h] [--arg ARG]    optional arguments:      -h, --help  show this help message and exit      --arg ARG   This same feature would be useful for arguments that would                  benefit from more explanation.                    1.
