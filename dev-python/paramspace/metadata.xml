	<longdescription>The **paramspace** package is an open-source project and Python package thatmakes it possible to conveniently define dictionary-based, multi-dimensionalparameter spaces and iterate over them.Why?----In Python, dictionaries provide a powerful tool to control program behaviour.Frequently, these configuration structures take the shape of highly nesteddictionaries, where each hierarchical level holds the information required atthat point of the program.However, it is frequently desired to instantiate some program not with a*single* set of parameters but with a set of parameters.Especially for scientific purposes, e.g. numerical simulations, it is oftenrequired to perform many instantiations of the same program with differentparameters, so-called parameter sweeps.For simple configuration structures, this can be easily achieved by basiccontrol flow tools; however, this becomes increasingly difficult the moreparameters are desired to be sweeped over or the further nested they are in theconfiguration hierarchy.This is where the paramspace package comes in.How?----At its core, the paramspace package supplies the ``ParamSpace`` class, whichaccepts a dictionary-like object. To define parameter dimensions, individualentries within that dictionary can be replaced by a ``ParamDim`` object,regardless of the position and nestedness within the dictionary.The parameter space is then the cartesian product of all parameter dimensions,each parameter opening a new dimension of the parameter space.When iterating over the space, each returned value is a dictionary with onecombination of parameters, ready to be passed on to run the desired program.This allows retaining a hierarchical configuration structure while at the sametime being able to conveniently perform sweeps over parameters, e.g. to spawnsimulations with.Furthermore, the paramspace package integrates tightly with YAML, making itvery simple to define multidimensional parameter spaces directly in aconfiguration file.Learn More----------For more information, visit the project page and have a look at the README:https://gitlab.com/blsqr/paramspaceFor use of paramspace, see `utopya &lt;https://gitlab.com/utopia-project/utopya&gt;`_or the `Utopia Project &lt;https://utopia-project.org/&gt;`_.</longdescription>
