	<longdescription>`r3l3453` is a small project that I use for semi-automating the release cycle on a few projects of mine. It expects the project to have a very specific configuration that I personally prefer, and therefore may not be suitable for other's projects.In short what it does is as follows:* Bump version(s) to a release version according to git log and `Conventional Commits`_.* Change the title of `Unreleased`_ section in ``CHANGELOG.rst`` to the new version.* Commit changes.* Tag the commit.* Release to PyPI.* Bump the version again to dev0 version for the next release.* Push changes to repository.There is a ``--simulate`` cli option which allows one to see what is going to happen... _Conventional Commits: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/.. _Unreleased: https://keepachangelog.com/</longdescription>
