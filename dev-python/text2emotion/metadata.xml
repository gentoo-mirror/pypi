	<longdescription># What is emotion?Emotion is a biological state associated with the nervous system brought on by neurophysiological changes variously associated with thoughts, feelings, behavioural responses, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure.(Source: Wikipedia)Human being can easily identify the emotions from text and experience it. But what about the machines, are they able to identify the emotions from text?#### text2emotion is the python package which will help you to extract the emotions from the content.- Processes any textual message and recognize the emotions embedded in it.- Compatible with 5 different emotion categories as Happy, Angry, Sad, Surprise and Fear.## Features&gt; ##### 1. Text Pre-processing&gt; At first we have the major goal to perform data cleaning and make the content suitable for emotion analysis.&gt; - Remove the unwanted textual part from the message.&gt; - Perform the natural language processing techniques.&gt; - Bring out the well pre-processed text from the text pre-processing.&gt; ##### 2. Emotion Investigation&gt; Detect emotion from every word that we got from pre-processed text and take a count of it for further analytical process.&gt; - Find the appropriate words that express emotions or feelings.&gt; - Check the emotion category of each word.&gt; - Store the count of emotions relevant to the words found.&gt; ##### 3. Emotion Analysis&gt; After emotion investigation, there is the time of getting the significant output for the textual message we input earlier.&gt; - The output will be in the form of dictionary.&gt; - There will be keys as emotion categories and values as emotion score.&gt; - Higher the score of a particular emotion category, we can conclude that the message belongs to that category.## How to use?#### [Check Demo on Colab](https://bit.ly/3hlXujZ)## App DeploymentHere's the code implementation with **Streamlit App** for the users.1.
