This was usedin ECE 387 Introduction to Robotics class I taught at the US Air Force Academy.- [video](https://vimeo.com/266619301): robot could only follow the black tap road and couldn't run into anything. If anything got in the way, it had to naviage around it to its final destination- [video](https://vimeo.com/266619767): robot pet, follow the pink ball- [video](https://vimeo.com/266619636): robot pet, follow the pink ball## Install### pipThe recommended way to install this library is:```bashpip install pycreate2```### DevelopmentIf you wish to develop and submit git-pulls, you can do:```bashgit clone https://github.com/walchko/pycreate2cd pycreate2poetry installpoetry run pytest -v```## UseThere are multiple ways to command the Create to move, here are someexamples:```pythonfrom  pycreate2 import Create2import time# Create a Create2.port = &quot;/dev/serial&quot;  # where is your serial port?bot = Create2(port)# Start the Create 2bot.start()# Put the Create2 into 'safe' mode so we can drive it# This will still provide some protectionbot.safe()# You are responsible for handling issues, no protection/safety in# this mode ... becarefulbot.full()# directly set the motor speeds ... move forwardbot.drive_direct(100, 100)time.sleep(2)# turn in placebot.drive_direct(200,-200)  # inputs for motors are +/- 500 maxtime.sleep(2)# Stop the botbot.drive_stop()# query some sensorssensors = bot.get_sensors()  # returns all dataprint(sensors.light_bumper_left)# Close the connection# bot.close()```More examples are found in the [examplesfolder](https://github.com/walchko/pycreate2/tree/master/examples).## DocumentsAdditional notes and documents are in the [docsfolder](https://github.com/walchko/pycreate2/tree/master/docs/Markdown).### Modes![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/walchko/pycreate2/master/pics/create_modes.png)The different modes (OFF, PASSIVE, SAFE, and FULL) can be switchedbetween by calling different commands.  - **OFF:** The robot is off and can charge, it will accept no commands  - **PASSIVE:** The robot is in standbye and can charge. It will send    sensor packets, but will not move  - **SAFE:** The robot will not charge, but you full control over it    with a few exceptions. If the cliff sensors or wheel drop sensors    are triggered, the robot goes back to PASSIVE mode.  - **FULL:** The robot will not charge and you have full control. You    are responsible to handle any response due to cliff, wheel drop or    any other sensors.### Sensor DataSensor data is returned as a `namedtuple` from `collections`. Theinformation can be accessed as either:```pythonsensors = bot.get_sensors()sensors.wall == sensors[1]  # True```| Sensor                       | Range             | Index ||------------------------------|-------------------|-------|| bumps\_wheeldrops            | \[0-15\]          |   0   || wall                         | \[0-1\]           |   1   || cliff\_left                  | \[0-1\]           |   2   || cliff\_front\_left           | \[0-1\]           |   3   || cliff\_front\_right          | \[0-1\]           |   4   || cliff\_right                 | \[0-1\]           |   5   || virtual\_wall                | \[0-1\]           |   6   || overcurrents                 | \[0-29\]          |   7   || dirt\_detect                 | \[0-255\]         |   8   || ir\_opcode                   | \[0-255\]         |   9   || buttons                      | \[0-255\]         |   10  || distance                     | \[-322768-32767\] |   11  || angle                        | \[-322768-32767\] |   12  || charger\_state               | \[0-6\]           |   13  || voltage                      | \[0-65535\]       |   14  || current                      | \[-322768-32767\] |   15  || temperature                  | \[-128-127\]      |   16  || battery\_charge              | \[0-65535\]       |   17  || battery\_capacity            | \[0-65535\]       |   18  || wall\_signal                 | \[0-1023\]        |   19  || cliff\_left\_signal          | \[0-4095\]        |   20  || cliff\_front\_left\_signal   | \[0-4095\]        |   21  || cliff\_front\_right\_signal  | \[0-4095\]        |   22  || cliff\_right\_signal         | \[0-4095\]        |   23  || charger\_available           | \[0-3\]           |   24  || open\_interface\_mode        | \[0-3\]           |   25  || song\_number                 | \[0-4\]           |   26  || song\_playing                | \[0-1\]           |   27  || oi\_stream\_num\_packets     | \[0-108\]         |   28  || velocity                     | \[-500-500\]      |   29  || radius                       | \[-322768-32767\] |   30  || velocity\_right              | \[-500-500\]      |   31  || velocity\_left               | \[-500-500\]      |   32  || encoder\_counts\_left        | \[-322768-32767\] |   33  || encoder\_counts\_right       | \[-322768-32767\] |   34  || light\_bumper                | \[0-127\]         |   35  || light\_bumper\_left          | \[0-4095\]        |   36  || light\_bumper\_front\_left   | \[0-4095\]        |   37  || light\_bumper\_center\_left  | \[0-4095\]        |   38  || light\_bumper\_center\_right | \[0-4095\]        |   39  || light\_bumper\_front\_right  | \[0-4095\]        |   40  || light\_bumper\_right         | \[0-4095\]        |   41  || ir\_opcode\_left             | \[0-255\]         |   42  || ir\_opcode\_right            | \[0-255\]         |   43  || left\_motor\_current         | \[-322768-32767\] |   44  || right\_motor\_current        | \[-322768-32767\] |   45  || main\_brush\_current         | \[-322768-32767\] |   46  || side\_brush\_current         | \[-322768-32767\] |   47  || statis                       | \[0-3\]           |   48  |## Change Log|            |       |                               || ---------- | ----- | ----------------------------- || 2020-02-16 | 0.8.0 | Simplified interface and bug fixes || 2020-02-16 | 0.7.7 | Fixed typo with poetry        || 2020-02-16 | 0.7.6 | Fixed typo erro in `bin`      || 2020-02-16 | 0.7.5 | Switched to toml and poetry   || 2019-06-30 | 0.7.4 | Midi sounds working           || 2017-08-26 | 0.7.3 | code clean up and doc updates || 2017-08-26 | 0.7.2 | updates and fixes             || 2017-05-26 | 0.5.0 | init and published to pypi    |# The MIT License**Copyright (c) 2007 Damon Kohler****Copyright (c) 2015 Jonathan Le Roux (Modifications for Create 2)****Copyright (c) 2015 Brandon Pomeroy****Copyright (c) 2017 Kevin Walchko**Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining acopy of this software and associated documentation files (the&quot;Software&quot;), to deal in the Software without restriction, includingwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and topermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject tothe following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be includedin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESSOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OFMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANYCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.</longdescription>
