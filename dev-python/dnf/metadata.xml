	<longdescription># pypi-dnfDummy package reserved for any future possibility of having DNF Python API available through PyPI. Installing this package will not be completed as it is intended to be empty therefore installation failure will be thrown.A number of DNF's dependencies (notable libdnf and libsolv) are currentlyonly available as part of Linux distro packages.Right now, this package just reserves the `dnf` name on PyPI to avoid thepotential for a name conflict with the `python3-dnf` packages on Linux distrosusing DNF for RPM dependency management.However, I eventually hope to replace it with a CMake-dependent PEP 517 backendthat runs the full libdnf build process, and then emits a statically linkedcompletely self-contained extension module as part of a wheel file (togetherwith the pure Python components of the DNF Python API).</longdescription>
