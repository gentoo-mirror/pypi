	<longdescription># Bitcoin Hardware Wallet Interface[![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/bitcoin-core/HWI.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/bitcoin-core/HWI)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/hwi/badge/?version=latest)](https://hwi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)The Bitcoin Hardware Wallet Interface is a Python library and command line tool for interacting with hardware wallets.It provides a standard way for software to work with hardware wallets without needing to implement device specific drivers.Python software can use the provided library (`hwilib`). Software in other languages can execute the `hwi` tool.Caveat emptor: Inclusion of a specific hardware wallet vendor does not imply any endorsement of quality or security.## PrerequisitesPython 3 is required. The libraries and [udev rules](hwilib/udev/README.md) for each device must also be installed. Some libraries will need to be installedFor Ubuntu/Debian:```sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev python3-dev```For Centos:```sudo yum -y install python3-devel libusbx-devel systemd-devel```For macOS:```brew install libusb```## Install```git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI.gitcd HWIpoetry install # or 'pip3 install .' or 'python3 setup.py install'```This project uses the [Poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry) dependency manager. HWI and its dependencies can be installed via poetry by executing the following in the root source directory:```poetry install```Pip can also be used to automatically install HWI and its dependencies using the `setup.py` file (which is usually in sync with `pyproject.toml`):```pip3 install .```The `setup.py` file can be used to install HWI and its dependencies so long as `setuptools` is also installed:```pip3 install -U setuptoolspython3 setup.py install```## DependenciesSee `pyproject.toml` for all dependencies. Dependencies under `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` are user dependencies, and `[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]` for development based dependencies. These dependencies will be installed with any of the three above installation methods.## UsageTo use, first enumerate all devices and find the one that you want to use with```./hwi.py enumerate```Once the device type and device path is known, issue commands to it like so:```./hwi.py -t &lt;type&gt; -d &lt;path&gt; &lt;command&gt; &lt;command args&gt;```All output will be in JSON form and sent to `stdout`.Additional information or prompts will be sent to `stderr` and will not necessarily be in JSON.This additional information is for debugging purposes.To see a complete list of available commands and global parameters, run`./hwi.py --help`.  To see options specific to a particular command,pass the `--help` parameter after the command name; for example:```./hwi.py getdescriptors --help```## DocumentationDocumentation for HWI can be found on [readthedocs.io](https://hwi.readthedocs.io/).### Device SupportFor documentation on devices supported and how they are supported, please check the [device support page](https://hwi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devices/index.html#support-matrix)### Using with Bitcoin CoreSee [Using Bitcoin Core with Hardware Wallets](https://hwi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/bitcoin-core-usage.html).## LicenseThis project is available under the MIT License, Copyright Andrew Chow.</longdescription>
