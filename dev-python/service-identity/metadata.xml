	<longdescription># Service Identity Verification for pyOpenSSL &amp; *cryptography*Use this package if:- you want to **verify** that a [PyCA *cryptography*](https://cryptography.io/) certificate is valid for a certain hostname or IP address,- or if you use [pyOpenSSL](https://pypi.org/project/pyOpenSSL/) and don’t want to be [**MITM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)ed,- or if you want to **inspect** certificates from either for service IDs.*service-identity* aspires to give you all the tools you need for verifying whether a certificate is valid for the intended purposes.In the simplest case, this means *host name verification*.However, *service-identity* implements [RFC 6125](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6125.html) fully.## Project Information*service-identity* is released under the [MIT](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/blob/main/LICENSE) license, its documentation lives at [Read the Docs](https://service-identity.readthedocs.io/), the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity), and the latest release on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/service-identity/).### Credits*service-identity* is written and maintained by [Hynek Schlawack](https://hynek.me/).The development is kindly supported by my employer [Variomedia AG](https://www.variomedia.de/), *service-identity*'s [Tidelift subscribers][Tidelift], and all my amazing [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hynek).### *service-identity* for EnterpriseAvailable as part of the Tidelift Subscription.The maintainers of *service-identity* and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open-source packages you use to build your applications.Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact packages you use.[Learn more.][Tidelift][Tidelift]: https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-service-identity?utm_source=pypi-service-identity&amp;utm_medium=readme## Release Information### Removed- All Python versions up to and including 3.7 have been dropped.- Support for `commonName` in certificates has been dropped.  It has been deprecated since 2017 and isn't supported by any major browser.- The oldest supported pyOpenSSL version (when using the `pyopenssl` backend) is now 17.0.0.  When using such an old pyOpenSSL version, you have to pin *cryptography* yourself to ensure compatibility between them.  Please check out [`contraints/oldest-pyopenssl.txt`](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/blob/main/tests/constraints/oldest-pyopenssl.txt) to verify what we are testing against.### Deprecated- If you've used `service_identity.(cryptography|pyopenssl).extract_ids()`, please switch to the new names `extract_patterns()`.  [#56](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/pull/56)### Added- `service_identity.(cryptography|pyopenssl).extract_patterns()` are now public APIs (FKA `extract_ids()`).  You can use them to extract the patterns from a certificate without verifying anything.  [#55](https://github.com/pyca/service-identity/pull/55)- *service-identity* is now fully typed.
