	<longdescription>General-purpose finite element solver - pyfe3d==============================================Github Actions status:[![Actions Status](https://github.com/saullocastro/pyfe3d/workflows/pytest/badge.svg)](https://github.com/saullocastro/pyfe3d/actions)Coverage status:[![Codecov Status](https://codecov.io/gh/saullocastro/pyfe3d/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=KVZCRIACL7)](https://codecov.io/gh/saullocastro/pyfe3d)About pyfe3d------------The ``pyfe3d`` module is a general-purpose finite element solver for structuralanalysis and optimization based on Python and Cython. The main principlesguiding the development of ``pyfe3d`` are: simplicity, efficiency andcompatibility. The aimed level of compatibility allows one to run this solverin any platform, including the Google Colab environment.Citing this library-------------------Saullo G. P. Castro. (2023). General-purpose finite element solver based on Python and Cython (Version 0.3.24). Zenodo. DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6573489.Documentation-------------The documentation is available on: https://saullocastro.github.io/pyfe3d.Important features of this library----------------------------------- efficient and simple for linear and nonlinear analyses- importable and cimportable code- 6 degrees-of-freedom per nodeAvailable finite elements-------------------------- 'Quad4R' - 4-node plate with linear interpolation, equivalent to Abaqus' S4Ror Nastran's CQUAD4.- 'Tria3R' - 3-node plate with linear interpolation, equivalent to Abaqus' S3Ror Nastran's CTRIA3.- 'BeamLR' - 2-node Timoshenko beam element with linear interpolation andreduced integration.- 'BeamC' - 2-node Timoshenko beam element with consistent shape functions andanalytical integration.- 'Spring' - 2-node spring element with 6 stiffenesses defined in the element  coordinate system.- 'Truss' - 2-node truss element with only axial and torsion stiffness. Irecommend using the BeamLR instead, which is physically more consistent.License-------Distrubuted under the 3-Clause BSD license(https://raw.github.com/saullocastro/pyfe3d/master/LICENSE)::    Copyright (c) 2021-2023, Saullo G.
