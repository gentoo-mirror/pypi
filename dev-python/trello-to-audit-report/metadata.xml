Please see [this repo](https://github.com/ChainAccelOrg/audit-report-templating) for learning how to install and work with pandoc. You will additionally need the `eisvogel.latex` template. You can find more information in the repo linked above. ## InstallationThere are a few options with how to install.### pipx We recommend using `pipx` as it installs your package into a virtual environment. ```pipx install trello_to_audit_report```Then, verify it's installation: ```trello_to_audit_report -v```To upgrade to the lastest version, run:```pipx upgrade trello_to_audit_report```You should get an output like `x.x.x`### pipOtherwise, you can use `pip`.```pip install trello_to_audit_report```### From SourceYou can install from source.```git clone https://github.com/ChainAccelOrg/trello_to_audit_reportcd trello_to_audit_reportpip install . -e```## Quickstart - CSV1. Place all your findings in a list on a trello board, and have one list called `Report`2. [Export your board](https://support.atlassian.com/trello/docs/exporting-data-from-trello/) to a `.csv` file3. Run:```trello_to_audit_report &lt;PATH_TO_YOUR_CSV&gt;```And you'll get a file named `output.md` with all your code formatted!## Quickstart - Directly from TrelloTo create a report directly from Trello, do the following:1. Create an [API Key &amp; Token](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/api-introduction/)   1. Navigate to [trello power ups](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin)   2. Select &quot;New&quot;   3. Fill in some information (you can skip the Iframe connector stuff)   4. Then, select the hyperlinked &quot;token&quot; on that page, and &quot;turn on&quot; your token by [authenticating it.](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/api-introduction/#authentication-and-authorization)   5. Save the API Key and Token 2. Create `TRELLO_API_KEY` and `TRELLO_API_TOKEN` environment variables.   1. Or, you can pass them in as flags if you're unfamiliar with environment variables3. Select your board ID   1. Each trello board has an ID, you can find it by looking at the URL of the board you're working with      1. &lt;img src=&quot;./img/trello-url.png&quot; width=&quot;225&quot;&gt;4. Make sure you have the following:   1. The list of findings are in a list labeled &quot;report       1. &lt;img src=&quot;./img/list-report.png&quot; width=&quot;225&quot;&gt;   2. Each report has the report written and named `report.md` (if you don't have one, it'll just grab the first `.md` attachment. If no `.md`, the first attachment. If no attachment, it will error. )   3. Each report has a label of &quot;HIGH&quot;, &quot;MEDIUM&quot;, &quot;LOW&quot;, &quot;QA&quot;, or &quot;GAS&quot;       1. &lt;img src=&quot;./img/requirements.png&quot; width=&quot;225&quot;&gt;5. Run the following```trello_to_audit_report &lt;BOARD_ID&gt; --api-key &lt;API_KEY&gt; --token &lt;API_TOKEN&gt;```And you should get a markdown output to `output.md`!## Quickstart - AdvancedThe package can also:- Generate a PDF- Add any default text before the fileWe have some examples in this repo if you [installed from source](#from-source).```trello_to_audit_report 1AhNmEQE --pdf-output examples/example_pdf.pdf --text-before-file examples/example_text_before.md -o ./examples/example_markdown.md```Or, if you have a certain severity like QA in a single ticket, run the following:```trello_to_audit_report 1AhNmEQE --pdf-output examples/example_pdf.pdf --text-before-file examples/example_text_before.md -o ./examples/example_markdown.md -e Q```# More ResourcesYou can then, dump it into `pandoc` to generate a PDF. We have [a repo](https://github.com/ChainAccelOrg/audit-report-templating) that shows you how to do that as well. </longdescription>
