	<longdescription>Thermal Engineering Systems in Python=====================================TESPy stands for &quot;Thermal Engineering Systems in Python&quot; and provides apowerful simulation toolkit for thermal engineering plants such as powerplants, district heating systems or heat pumps. It is an external extensionmodule within the Open Energy Modelling Framework `oemof &lt;https://oemof.org/&gt;`_and can be used as a standalone package... figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oemof/tespy/9915f013c40fe418947a6e4c1fd0cd0eba45893c/docs/api/_images/logo_tespy_big.svg    :align: centerWith the TESPy package you are able to calculate stationary operation in orderto design the process of thermal energy systems. From that point it is possibleto simulate the offdesign behavior of your plant using underlyingcharacteristics for each of the plants components. The package includes basiccomponents, such as turbines, pumps, compressors, heat exchangers, pipes,mixers and splitters as well as some advanced components (derivatives of heatexchangers, drum).Everybody is welcome to use and/or develop TESPy. Contribution is alreadypossible on a low level by simply fixing typos in TESPy's documentation orrephrasing sections which are unclear. If you want to support us that wayplease fork the TESPy repository to your own GitHub account and make changesas described in the GitHub guidelines:https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/Key Features============* **Open** Source* **Generic** thermal engineering applications* **Automatic** model documentation in LaTeX for high transparency and  reproducibility* **Extendable** framework for the implementation of custom components and  component groups* **Postprocessing** features like exergy analysis and fluid property plotting.. start-badges.. list-table::    :stub-columns: 1    * - docs      - |docs|    * - tests      - |pytests| |checks| |packaging| |coveralls|    * - package      - | |version| |wheel| |supported-versions| |commits-since|    * - reference      - |joss| |zenodo|.. |docs| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/tespy/badge/?style=flat    :target: https://readthedocs.org/projects/tespy    :alt: Documentation Status.. |pytests| image:: https://github.com/oemof/tespy/workflows/tox%20pytests/badge.svg    :target: https://github.com/oemof/tespy/actions?query=workflow%3A%22tox+pytests%22    :alt: tox pytest.. |checks| image:: https://github.com/oemof/tespy/workflows/tox%20checks/badge.svg    :target: https://github.com/oemof/tespy/actions?query=workflow%3A%22tox+checks%22    :alt: tox checks.. |packaging| image:: https://github.com/oemof/tespy/workflows/packaging/badge.svg    :target: https://github.com/oemof/tespy/actions?query=workflow%3Apackaging    :alt: packaging.. |coveralls| image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/oemof/tespy/badge.svg?branch=main&amp;service=github    :alt: Coverage Status    :target: https://coveralls.io/r/oemof/tespy.. |version| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/tespy.svg    :alt: PyPI Package latest release    :target: https://pypi.org/project/tespy.. |wheel| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/wheel/tespy.svg    :alt: PyPI Wheel    :target: https://pypi.org/project/tespy.. |supported-versions| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/tespy.svg    :alt: Supported Python versions    :target: https://pypi.org/project/tespy.. |commits-since| image:: https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/oemof/tespy/latest/dev    :alt: Commits since latest release    :target: https://github.com/oemof/tespy/compare/main...dev.. |zenodo| image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.2555866.svg   :alt: Release archive   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2555866.. |joss| image:: https://joss.theoj.org/papers/590b0b4767606bce4d0ebe397d4b7a4f/status.svg   :alt: Software Paper in JOSS   :target: https://joss.theoj.org/papers/590b0b4767606bce4d0ebe397d4b7a4f.. end-badgesDocumentation=============You can find the full documentation at`readthedocs &lt;http://tespy.readthedocs.org&gt;`_. Use the`project site &lt;http://readthedocs.org/projects/tespy&gt;`_ of readthedocs tochoose the version of the documentation. Go to the`download page &lt;http://readthedocs.org/projects/tespy/downloads/&gt;`_ todownload different versions and formats (pdf, html, epub) of the documentation.To get the latest news visit and follow our `website &lt;https://www.oemof.org&gt;`_.Installing TESPy================If you have a working Python3 environment, use pypi to install the latesttespy version:.. code:: bash  pip install tespyIf you want to use the latest features, you might want to install the**developer version**. See section`Developing TESPy &lt;http://tespy.readthedocs.io/en/dev/development/how.html&gt;`_for more information. The developer version is not recommended for productiveuse.Get in touch============Online &quot;Stammtisch&quot;-------------------We have decided to start a reoccurring &quot;Stammtisch&quot; meeting for all interestedTESPy users and (potential) developers. You are invited to join us on every 3rdMonday of a month at 17:00 CE(S)T for a casual get together. The first meetingwill be held at June, 20, 2022. The intent of this meeting is to establish amore active and well-connected network of TESPy users and developers.If you are interested, you can simply join the meeting athttps://meet.jit.si/tespy_user_meeting. We are looking forward to seeing you!User forum----------We have implemented a`discussion room on GitHub &lt;https://github.com/oemof/tespy/discussions&gt;`__ asuser forum. If you have issues with setting up your model or any other questionabout using the software, you are invited to start a discussion there.Examples========For a short introduction on how TESPy works and how you can use it, we providean extensive `user guide &lt;https://tespy.readthedocs.io/en/main/&gt;`__. You candownload all python scripts of the examples and tutorials from this GitHubrepository. They are included in the &quot;tutorial&quot; directory.Citation========The scope and functionalities of TESPy have been documented in a paperpublished in the Journal of Open Source Software with an Open-Access license.Download the paper from https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02178.
