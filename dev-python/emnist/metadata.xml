	<longdescription># EMNISTExtended MNIST - Python Package## The EMNIST DatasetThe EMNIST Dataset is an extension to the original MNIST dataset to also include letters. For more details, seethe [EMNIST web page](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/emnist-dataset) and the [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05373) associated with its release:  Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., &amp; van Schaik, A. (2017).  EMNIST: an extension of MNIST to handwritten letters.  Retrieved from http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05373## The EMNIST Python PackageThis package is a convenience wrapper around the EMNIST Dataset. The package provides functionality to automatically download and cache the dataset, and to load it as numpy arrays, minimizing the boilerplate necessary to make use of the dataset. (NOTE: The author of the Python package is not affiliated in any way with the authors of the dataset and the associated paper.)## InstallationTo install the EMNIST Python package along with its dependencies, run the following command:  pip install emnistThe dataset itself is automatically downloaded and cached when needed. To preemptively download the dataand avoid a delay later during the execution of your program, execute the following command afterinstallation:  python -c &quot;import emnist; emnist.ensure_cached_data()&quot;Alternately, if you have already downloaded the original IDX-formatted dataset from the EMNIST web page,copy or move it to `~/.cache/emnist/`, where `~` is your home folder, and rename it from `gzip.zip` to `emnist.zip`. The package will use the existing file rather than downloading it again.## UsageUsage of the EMNIST Python package is designed to be very simple. To get a listing of the available subsets:```python  &gt;&gt;&gt; from emnist import list_datasets  &gt;&gt;&gt; list_datasets()  ['balanced', 'byclass', 'bymerge', 'digits', 'letters', 'mnist']```(See the [EMNIST web page](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/emnist-dataset) for details on each of these subsets.)To load the training samples for the 'digits' subset:```python  &gt;&gt;&gt; from emnist import extract_training_samples  &gt;&gt;&gt; images, labels = extract_training_samples('digits')  &gt;&gt;&gt; images.shape  (240000, 28, 28)  &gt;&gt;&gt; labels.shape  (240000,)```To load the test samples for the 'digits' subset:```python  &gt;&gt;&gt; from emnist import extract_test_samples  &gt;&gt;&gt; images, labels = extract_test_samples('digits')  &gt;&gt;&gt; images.shape  (40000, 28, 28)  &gt;&gt;&gt; labels.shape  (40000,)```Data is extracted directly from the downloaded compressed file to minimize disk usage, and is returned as standard numpy arrays.</longdescription>
