	<longdescription>The aws-prototyping-sdk provides stable CDK and Projen constructs, allowing developers to have access to higher level abstractions than provided by the CDK or Projen alone.For detailed documentation, please refer to the [documentation website](https://aws.github.io/aws-prototyping-sdk/).## BundlingThis package simply bundles various packages from the `@aws-prototyping-sdk` namespace which have been marked as `stable`. As such, not all constructs or classes may be exported from this package and will need to be explicitly imported by creating a dependency on the individual packages.To illustrate, at the time of writing the following individual packages are published:```@aws-prototyping-sdk        |_ pipeline       : [stable]        |_ nx-monorepo    : [stable]        |_ static-website : [experimental]        |_ identity       : [experimental]```The aws-prototyping-sdk package will bundle all stable packages and export them as namespaces as follows:```aws-prototyping-sdk        |_ pipeline        |_ nx_monorepo```This means if you wanted to access the PDKPipeline which is a stable construct, you simply add a dependency on the `aws-prototyping-sdk` and import it as follows:```pythonimport { nx_monorepo, pipeline } from &quot;aws-prototyping-sdk&quot;;```To import `experimental` constructs, a dependency on the individual package is required. In the case of `static-website`, a dependency on `@aws-prototyping-sdk/static-website` is required. The constructs can then be imported as follows:```pythonimport { StaticWebsite } from &quot;@aws-prototyping-sdk/static-website&quot;;```</longdescription>
