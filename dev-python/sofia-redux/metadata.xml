Questions specific to particular data setsshould be directed to the `SOFIA helpdesk &lt;sofia_help@sofia.usra.edu&gt;`__.SOFIA pipelines are developed internally by the USRA/SOFIA data processingsoftware team, then are published publicly at the`SOFIA Redux GitHub project&lt;https://github.com/SOFIA-USRA/sofia_redux&gt;`__.Contributions and feedback are welcome via the GitHub project, butmerge requests cannot be directly accepted.  They will be internally reviewed,and pushed to the public site as needed.For more information about installing and using this package, seethe `online documentation &lt;https://SOFIA-USRA.github.io/sofia_redux/&gt;`__,or `docs/install.rst &lt;docs/install.rst&gt;`__ in the source distribution.License-------This project is Copyright (c) Universities Space Research Associationunder Government Prime Contract Number NNA17BF53C and licensed underthe terms of the BSD 3-Clause license.This package is released under the BSD 3-clause license by written permissionfrom Dr. Attila Kovacs, copyright holder of the CRUSH software, which is theoriginal work of authorship for the sofia_redux.scan module.This package is also based upon the`Astropy package template &lt;https://github.com/astropy/package-template&gt;`_which is licensed under the BSD 3-clause license.See the LICENSE.rst for more information.</longdescription>
