The project's main goal is toprovide a client for platforms and file systems that are no longer directly supported byDropbox.Maestral currently does not support Dropbox Paper, the management of Dropbox teams, andthe management of shared folder settings. If you need any of this functionality, pleaseuse the Dropbox website or the official client. Maestral does support syncingmultiple Dropbox accounts and excluding local files from sync with a &quot;.mignore&quot; file.The focus on &quot;simple&quot; file syncing does come with advantages: on macOS, the Maestral Appbundle is significantly smaller than the official Dropbox app and uses less memory. Theexact memory usage will depend on the size of your synced Dropbox folder and can be furtherreduced when running Maestral without a GUI.Maestral uses the public Dropbox API which, unlike the official client, does not supporttransferring only those parts of a file which changed (&quot;binary diff&quot;). Maestral maytherefore use more bandwidth that the official client. However, it will avoid uploadingor downloading a file if it already exists with the same content locally or in the cloud.## Warning- Never sync a local folder with both the official Dropbox client and Maestral at the same  time.- Network drives and some external hard drives are not supported as locations for the  Dropbox folder.## InstallationAn app bundle is provided for macOS High Sierra and higher and can be downloaded from theReleases tab. This app Bundle is also package as a Homebrew cask.On other platforms, you can download and install Maestral as a Python package from PyPI oras a Docker image from Docker Hub.For more detailed information on the installation, setup and system requirements, pleasecheck the [documentation](https://maestral.app/docs/installation).### HomebrewThe official Maestral releases are also available as Homebrew casks. If you have[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on your system, you can install using:```console$ brew install maestral```### Python package using PyPIPlease download and install the Python package from PyPI:```console$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade maestral```If you intend to use the graphical user interface, you also need to specify the GUI optionduring installation or upgrade. This will install the `maestral-qt` frontend and `PyQt5`on Linux and `maestral-cocoa` on macOS:```console$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade 'maestral[gui]'```### Docker imageA Docker image is available for x86, arm/v7 (32bit) and arm64 platforms and can beinstalled with:```colsole$ docker pull maestraldbx/maestral```## UsageRun `maestral gui` in the command line (or open the Maestral app on macOS) to startMaestral with a graphical user interface. On its first run, Maestral will guide youthrough linking and configuring your Dropbox and will then start syncing.&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamSchott/maestral-dropbox/master/screenshots/macOS_dark.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot macOS&quot; width=&quot;840&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamSchott/maestral-dropbox/master/screenshots/Ubuntu.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot Fedora&quot; width=&quot;840&quot;/&gt;### Command line usageAfter installation, Maestral will be available as a command line script by typing`maestral` in the command prompt. Type `maestral --help` to get a full list of availablecommands. The most important are:- `maestral gui`: Starts the Maestral GUI. Creates a sync daemon if not already running.- `maestral start|stop`: Starts or stops the Maestral sync daemon.- `maestral pause|resume`: Pauses or resumes syncing.- `maestral autostart -Y|-N`: Sets the daemon to start on log in.- `maestral status`: Gets the current status of Maestral.- `maestral filestatus LOCAL_PATH`: Gets the sync status of an individual file or folder.- `maestral excluded add|remove|list`: Command group to manage excluded folders.- `maestral ls DROPBOX_PATH`: Lists the contents of a directory on Dropbox.- `maestral notify snooze N`: Snoozes desktop notifications for N minutes.Maestral supports syncing multiple Dropbox accounts by running multiple instanceswith different configuration files. This needs to be configured from the commandline by passing the option `--config-name` to `maestral start` or `maestral gui`.Maestral will then select an existing config with the given name or create a new one.For example:```console$ maestral start --config-name=&quot;personal&quot;$ maestral start --config-name=&quot;work&quot;```This will start two instances of Maestral, syncing a private and a work account,respectively. Configs will be automatically cleared when unlinking an account. You canlist all currently linked accounts with `maestral config-files`. The above setup forexample will return the following on macOS:```console$ maestral config-filesConfig name  Account          Pathmaestral     user@gmail.com   ~/Library/Application Support/maestral/maestral.iniprivate      user@mycorp.org  ~/Library/Application Support/maestral/private.ini```By default, the Dropbox folder names will contain the capitalised config-name in braces.In the above case, this will be &quot;Dropbox (Personal)&quot; and &quot;Dropbox (Work)&quot;.A full documentation of the CLI is available on the[website](https://maestral.app/cli).## ContributeThere are multiple topics that could use your help. Some of them are easy, such as addingnew CLI commands, others require more experience, such as packaging for non-macOSplatforms. Look out for issues marked with &quot;good first issue&quot; or &quot;help wanted&quot;. Pullrequests should be made against the develop branch.Relevant resources are:- [Maestral API docs](https://maestral.readthedocs.io)- [Dropbox API docs](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/documentation)- [Dropbox Python SDK docs](https://dropbox-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) contains detailed information on the expected codestyle and test format.If you are using the macOS app bundle, please consider sponsoring the project with Â£1 permonth to offset the cost of an Apple Developer account to sign and notarize the bundle.## System requirements- macOS 10.13 High Sierra or higher or Linux- Python 3.7 or higher- For the system tray icon on Linux:  - [gnome-shell-extension-appindicator](https://github.com/ubuntu/gnome-shell-extension-appindicator)    on Gnome 3.26 and higher</longdescription>
