	<longdescription>Aerospike Python Client=======================|Build| |Release| |Wheel| |Downloads| |License|.. |Build| image:: https://travis-ci.org/aerospike/aerospike-client-python.svg?branch=master.. |Release| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/aerospike.svg.. |Wheel| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/wheel/aerospike.svg.. |Downloads| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/aerospike.svg.. |License| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/aerospike.svgCompatibility-------------The Python client for Aerospike works with Python 3.7 - 3.11 and supports the following OS'es:* macOS 11 and 12* CentOS 7 Linux* RHEL 8 and 9* Amazon Linux 2023* Debian 10, 11, and 12* Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04The client is also verified to run on these operating systems, but we do not officially support them (i.e we don't distribute wheels or prioritize fixing bugs for these OSes):* Alpine Linux**NOTE:** Aerospike Python client 5.0.0 and up MUST be used with Aerospike server 4.9 or later.If you see the error &quot;-10, ‘Failed to connect’&quot;, please make sure you are using server 4.9 or later.Install-------::    pip install aerospikeIn most cases ``pip`` will install a precompiled binary (wheel) matching your OSand version of Python. If a matching wheel isn't found it, or the``--install-option`` argument is provided, pip will build the Python clientfrom source.Please see the `build instructions &lt;https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-python/blob/master/BUILD.md&gt;`__for more.Troubleshooting~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~::    # client &gt;=3.8.0 will attempt a manylinux wheel installation for Linux distros    # to force a pip install from source:    pip install aerospike --no-binary :all:    # to troubleshoot pip versions &gt;= 6.0 you can    pip install --no-cache-dir aerospikeIf you run into trouble installing the client on a supported OS, you may beusing an outdated ``pip``.Versions of ``pip`` older than 7.0.0 should be upgraded, as well as versions of``setuptools`` older than 18.0.0.Troubleshooting macOS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In some versions of macOS, Python 2.7 is installed as ``python`` with``pip`` as its associated package manager, and Python 3 is installed as ``python3``with ``pip3`` as the associated package manager. Make sure to use the ones thatmap to Python 3, such as ``pip3 install aerospike``.Attempting to install the client with pip for the system default Python may cause permissions issues when copying necessary files. In order to avoidthose issues the client can be installed for the current user only with the command: ``pip install --user aerospike``::    # to trouleshoot installation on macOS try    pip install --no-cache-dir --user aerospikeBuild-----For instructions on manually building the Python client, please refer to`BUILD.md &lt;https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-python/blob/master/BUILD.md&gt;`__.Documentation-------------Documentation is hosted at `aerospike-python-client.readthedocs.io &lt;https://aerospike-python-client.readthedocs.io/&gt;`__and at `aerospike.com/apidocs/python &lt;http://www.aerospike.com/apidocs/python/&gt;`__.Examples--------Example applications are provided in the `examples directory of the GitHub repository &lt;https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-python/tree/master/examples/client&gt;`__For examples, to run the ``kvs.py``:::    python examples/client/kvs.pyBenchmarks----------To run the benchmarks the python module 'tabulate' need to be installed. In order to display heap information the module `guppy` must be installed.Note that `guppy` is only available for Python2. If `guppy` is not installed the benchmarks will still be runnable.Benchmark applications are provided in the `benchmarks directory of the GitHub repository &lt;https://github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-python/tree/master/benchmarks&gt;`__By default the benchmarks will try to connect to a server located at 127.0.0.1:3000 , instructions on changing that setting and other command line flags may be displayed by appending the `--help` argument to the benchmark script. For example:::    python benchmarks/keygen.py --helpLicense-------The Aerospike Python Client is made availabled under the terms of theApache License, Version 2, as stated in the file ``LICENSE``.Individual files may be made available under their own specific license,all compatible with Apache License, Version 2.
