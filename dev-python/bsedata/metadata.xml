It can be used in various types of projects which require getting live quotes for a given stock or index or build large data sets for data analysis.The data is as accurate as provided on the [BSE website](m.bseindia.com).&gt; **Please do not use this application for production usage. It is best used for learning and building application for your own use. For commercial application you better buy a data service.**&gt;&gt; **This library uses MIT license hence liability lies with the user and not the author of the application.**&gt;&gt; **As per India's IT act it is no where mentioned that we cannot scrape a website. It's up to me whether I consume the publicly available data &quot;visually&quot; or through my programme or using some kind of &quot;web reader&quot;. As long as data you are scrapping is available in public domain and you are not breaching security and accessing data of private nature with malicious intent, it cannot be termed as illegal.**&gt;&gt; **But it can certainly be termed &quot;unethical&quot; (which is equally bad) since you are damaging the service itself. Hence be prudent about how much stress you cause to the backend. BSE's website is very capable and even they will not mind if someone is scrapping their website for educational purposes.**## Features- Getting live quotes using stock codes in Python dicttionaries- Getting list of top losers- Getting list of top gainers- Getting quotes for all the indices traded in BSE- Helper APIs to check whether a given stock code or index code is correct- Getting list of all indices and stocks## Roadmap- Get details of an individual index- Complete unit test coverage- Daily OHLCV data- Historical EOD OHLCV data## Dependencies- [BeautifulSoup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)- [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)- [lxml](https://lxml.de/)- A working internet connection :wink:## UsageRefer the documentation at &lt;https://bsedata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html&gt;## Change LogRefer the documentation at &lt;https://bsedata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chglog.html&gt;## LicenseMIT LicenseCopyright (c) 2018 Shrey DabhiPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
