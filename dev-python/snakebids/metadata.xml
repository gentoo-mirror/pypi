It offers:* Flexible data grabbing with PyBIDS, configurable solely by config file entries* Helper function for creating BIDS paths inside Snakemake workflows/rules* Command-line invocation of snakemake workflows with BIDS App compliance* Configurable argument parsing specified using the Snakemake workflow config* Execution either as command-line BIDS apps or via snakemake executableContributing============Clone the git repository. Snakebids dependencies are managed with Poetry (vesion 1.2 or higher), which you'll need installed on your machine. You can find instructions on the [poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installation). Then, setup the development environment with the following commands:```bashpoetry installpoetry run poe setup```Snakebids uses [poethepoet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) as a task runner. You can see what commands are available by running:```bashpoetry run poe```If you wish, you can also run `poe [command]` directly by installing `poethepoet` on your system. Follow the install instructions at the link above.Tests are done with `pytest` and can be run via:```bashpoetry run poe test```Snakebids uses pre-commit hooks (installed via the `poe setup` command above) to lint and format code (we use [black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort), [pylint](https://pylint.org/) and [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)). By default, these hooks are run on every commit. Please be sure they all pass before making a PR.</longdescription>
