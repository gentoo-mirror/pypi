	<longdescription># earwormCreate a simple web page to listen to audio files in a directory## SetupThe package is available on PyPI and you can install it using pip/conda.```shpip install earworm```## UsageThis tool can generate a simple HTML page from a directory of music files. Thetool can read metadata from files directly (currently only supports MP3 filesand ID3 tags). But, if you have files which are not MP3, you can use a CSV filewith the metadata.The CSV file **must** have the following columns `filename` and `title`, andany additional ones you may want. A template can be generated using the tool --see step 3 below.1. To get started create a sample config file:   ```sh   earworm make-config -c config.yml   ```1. Change the value of `music_dir` to the directory where you have your music   files. If you wish to use a CSV file for the metadata, add a `metadata_csv`   entry to the config.   ```yaml   metadata_csv: &quot;/path/to/metadata.csv&quot;   ```1. You can generate a template for the `metadata.csv` from your `music_dir` by   running `earworm` with the `update-csv` sub-command. Once the CSV file is   generated, add a `metadata_csv` entry pointing to this file to your config.1. Run `earworm` to generate a directory called `output` with an   `index.html`, `music/` directory with all the music files that have &quot;valid   metadata&quot;, and a `covers/` directory with the cover images for the albums.1. You can specify the `&lt;title&gt;` of the page by using the `title` config var1. If the `base_url` parameter is specified, an `og:image` tag is added to the   page, using the latest song's cover image.1. Open the `index.html` in your browser to view the playlist locally.1. If you have access to a webserver, you can just sync the output directory to   your webserver.1. If you don't have access to a webserver you can use something like [Google   Drive](https://web.archive.org/web/20201127203126/https://www.ampercent.com/host-static-websites-google-driv/11070/)   or   [Dropbox](https://web.archive.org/web/20210117032036/https://www.ampercent.com/host-static-website-dropbox-free-webhosting/6426/)   to host this as a static website.1. A new music file can be added to an existing music directory and site using   the `add-audio` subcommand.   ```sh   earworm add-audio -c config.yml -i ~/Downloads/cover-image.jpg ~/Music/covers/song123.mp3   ```## Dev SetupWhen working on the source (py/html/CSS/JS) of the site, you can automaticallygenerate the html each time you make any changes to the input files using`entr`.```shls /path/to/config-file $(git ls-files) | entr earworm --config /path/to/config-file```### JS toolchainTo change the JS files, you need to have `rollup` installed and you can run therollup watcher (`rollup -w -c rollup.config.js`) to build the `bundle.js`.</longdescription>
