	<longdescription>This package provides an implementation of Donald Knuth's Dancing         Links algorithm for solving exact set cover problems.         1.0.4: Minor Python 3 bugfix.         1.0.3: Attempt to make code compatible with Python 3.         1.0.2: Removed extraneous code (had switched from callbacks for solutions to                making solve a generator to yield, but had forgotten to remove the                solution callback function parameter from the solve method).         1.0.1: Critical bugfix (N array was one short: did not account for header).         1.0.0: Initial release.</longdescription>
