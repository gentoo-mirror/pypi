Email biosteamdevelopmentgroup@gmail.com for details.What is BioSTEAM?-----------------BioSTEAM is a fast and flexible package for the design, simulation, techno-economic analysis, and life cycle assessment of biorefineries under uncertainty [1]_. BioSTEAM is built to streamline and automate early-stage technology evaluations and to enable rigorous sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Complete biorefinery configurations are available at the `Bioindustrial-Park &lt;https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/Bioindustrial-Park&gt;`_ GitHub repository, BioSTEAM's premier repository for biorefinery models and results. The long-term growth and maintenance of BioSTEAM is supported through both community-led development and the research institutions invested in BioSTEAM, including the `Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovations (CABBI) &lt;https://cabbi.bio/&gt;`_. Through its open-source and community-lead platform, BioSTEAM aims to foster communication and transparency within the biorefinery research community for an integrated effort to expedite the evaluation of candidate biofuels and bioproducts.Data on chemicals and algorithms to estimate thermodynamic properties are imported from `chemicals &lt;https://github.com/CalebBell/chemicals&gt;`_and `thermo &lt;https://github.com/CalebBell/chemicals&gt;`_,community-driven open-source libraries developed by Caleb Bell. BioSTEAM's premire thermodynamic engine, `thermosteam &lt;https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/thermosteam&gt;`_, builds upon these libraries to facilitate the creation of thermodynamic property packages.Installation------------Get the latest version of BioSTEAM from `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/biosteam/&gt;`__. If you have an installation of Python with pip, simple install it with:    $ pip install biosteamTo get the git version, run:    $ git clone git://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteamFor help on common installation issues, please visit the `documentation &lt;https://biosteam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation&gt;`__.Documentation-------------BioSTEAM's documentation is available on the web:    http://biosteam.readthedocs.io/Bug reports-----------To report bugs, please use the BioSTEAM's Bug Tracker at:    https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteamContributing------------For guidelines on how to contribute, visit:    https://biosteam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/index.htmlLicense information-------------------See ``LICENSE.txt`` for information on the terms &amp; conditions for usageof this software, and a DISCLAIMER OF ALL WARRANTIES.Although not required by the BioSTEAM license, if it is convenient for you,please cite BioSTEAM if used in your work.
