Designed to work with the [Brightway2 life cycle assessment framework](https://brightwaylca.org), but is generic enough to work in other use cases.                    In [1]: from bw2parameters import ParameterSet                    In [2]: parameters = {               ...:        'Deep_Thought': {'amount': 42},               ...:        'East_River_Creature': {'formula': '2 * Deep_Thought + 16'},               ...:        'Elders_of_Krikkit': {'formula': 'sqrt(East_River_Creature)'},               ...: }                    In [3]: ParameterSet(parameters).evaluate()            Out[3]: {'Deep_Thought': 42, 'East_River_Creature': 100, 'Elders_of_Krikkit': 10.0}                Compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.3+. 100% test coverage.
