	<longdescription>    This package will install Apache Toree as a Jupyter kernel.    Apache Toree is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software    Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.    Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review    indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process    have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.    While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness    or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be    fully endorsed by the ASF.    </longdescription>
