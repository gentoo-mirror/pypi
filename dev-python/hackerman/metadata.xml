	<longdescription># hackermanThe hackerman library is one I made for two reasons.1. Because I want to make, package, and publish my own library2. So I can use it in my penetration testing programsSo yeah# LicenseIt is licensed under the GNU GPL (more info in the &quot;LICENSE&quot; file). It is my first time adding a license so I don't really know if I did it right.Basically, don't distribute closed-source versions, but feel free to do whatever else you want with it, it would be cool if you credited me, though.</longdescription>
