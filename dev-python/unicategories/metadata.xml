	<longdescription># unicategoriesUnicode category database, generated and cached on setup.This module exposes a category dictionary containing `RangeGroup` instances,containing all unicode category character ranges detected on your system.## Example```pythonfrom unicategories import categoriesupperchars = categories['Lu'].characters()  # iteratorprint('Unicode uppercase caracters are &quot;%s&quot;' % ''.join(upperchars))# Unicode uppercase caracters are &quot;ABCDEF...&quot;```## RangeGroupImmutable iterable (based on tuple, with some useful methods) of (start, end)tuples being, like python's `range`, open at the end.This method have been chosen for memory efficiency, storing individually allcharacters on memory would take a lot of memory.RangeGroup class provides the following methods:### `range_group.characters()``type: () -&gt; typing.Iterator[str]````rstGet iterator with all characters on this range group.:returns: iterator of characters (str of size 1)```### `range_group.codes()``type: () -&gt; typing.Iterator[int]````rstGet iterator for all unicode code points contained in this range group.:returns: iterator of character indexes (int)```### `range_group.has(character)``type: (typing.Union[str, int]) -&gt; bool````rstGet if character (or character code point) is part of this range group.:param character: character or unicode code point to look for:returns: True if character is contained by any range, False otherwise```## Unicode categoriesTaken from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:General_Category_(Unicode)).| Value  | Category Major, minor      | Basic type     | Character assigned     | Fixed                                                       | Remarks                                                                                                                   ||--------|----------------------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| Lu     | Letter, uppercase          | Graphic        | Character              |                                                             |                                                                                                                           || Ll     | Letter, lowercase          | Graphic        | Character              |                                                             |                                                                                                                           || Lt     | Letter, titlecase          | Graphic        | Character              |                                                             | Ligatures containing uppercase followed by lowercase letters (e.g., `ǅ` , `ǈ` , `ǋ` , and `ǲ` )                           || Lm     | Letter, modifier           | Graphic        | Character              |                                                             |                                                                                                                           || Lo     | Letter, other              | Graphic        | Character              |                                                             |                                                                                                                           || Mn     | Mark, nonspacing           | Graphic        | Character              |                                                             |                                                                                                                           || Mc     | Mark, spacing combining    | Graphic        | Character              |                                                             |                                                                                                                           || Me     | Mark, enclosing            | Graphic        | Character              |                                                             |                                                                                                                           || Nd     | Number, decimal digit      | Graphic        | Character              |                                                             | All these, and only these, have Numeric Type = De                                                                         || Nl     | Number, letter             | Graphic        | Character              |                                                             | Numerals composed of letters or letterlike symbols (e.g., Roman numerals )                                                || No     | Number, other              | Graphic        | Character              |                                                             | E.g., vulgar fractions , superscript and subscript digits                                                                 || Pc     | Punctuation, connector     | Graphic        | Character              |                                                             | Includes &quot;_&quot;
