	<longdescription>mod2doctest===========mod2doctest is a module that converts a python module to a doctest compatible docstring.  It's kind of like taking a python script, pasting it into an interactiveinterpreter and then copying the output back into a docstring.  However, mod2doctest has many convenience to make this process easier like:     * Providing `#&gt;` and `#|` comments: `#&gt;` prints to both your docstring    and stdout and `#|` print just to your docstring (which will show    up as text in a sphinx generated webpage)    * adding ellipse markers for memory id / trace back     * Cleaning up / formatting your docstring for sphinx inclusion     * and a couple of other things, too.    For full documentation and several examples please visit http://packages.python.org/mod2doctest/.</longdescription>
