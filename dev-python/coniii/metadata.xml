	<longdescription>[![PyPI version fury.io](https://badge.fury.io/py/coniii.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coniii/) [![PyPI license](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/coniii.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coniii/)# Convenient Interface to Inverse IsingConIII is a Python package for solving maximum entropy problems with a focus on thepairwise maximum entropy model, also known as the inverse Ising problem.If you use ConIII for your research, please consider citing the following:&gt; Lee, E.D. and Daniels, B.C., 2019. Convenient Interface to Inverse Ising (ConIII): A&gt; Python 3 Package for Solving Ising-Type Maximum Entropy Models. Journal of Open Research&gt; Software, 7(1), p.3. DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/jors.217.The paper also contains an overview of the modules. For code documentation, see[here](https://eddielee.co/coniii/index.html &quot;Documentation&quot;).## InstallationTo set up an Anaconda environment called &quot;test&quot; and install from pip, run the following code. The openblas package is only recommended for AMD users.```bash$ conda create -n test -c conda-forge python=3.10 numpy scipy numba cython jupyter ipython multiprocess boost==1.74 matplotlib mpmath blas=*=openblas$ pip install coniii```If you have trouble using `pip`, then you can always build this package fromsource. The following code will down download the latest release from GitHub and installthe package. Make sure that you are running Python 3.10 and have boost v1.74.0installed.```bash$ git clone https://github.com/eltrompetero/coniii.git$ cd coniii$ ./pypi_compile.sh$ pip install dist/*.whl```#### Setting up exact solution for systems *N &gt; 9*If you would like to use the `Enumerate` solver for system sizes greater than 9 spins, youmust run enumerate.py to write those files yourself. This can be run from the installdirectory.  If you do not know where the installation directory is, you can find it bystarting a Python terminal and running```python&gt;&gt;&gt; import coniii&gt;&gt;&gt; coniii.__path__```Once inside the install directory, you can run in your bash shell```bash$ python enumerate.py [N] 1```where `[N]` should be replaced by the size of the system. This specifies that the system should be written for the {-1,1} basis. Note that the package uses the {-1,1} basis by default. For more details, see the `__main__` block at the end of the file enumerate.py.For the {0,1} basis, use```bash$ python enumerate.py [N]```## Quick guide with Jupyter notebookA [Jupyternotebook](https://github.com/eltrompetero/coniii/blob/py3/ipynb/usage_guide.ipynb) with abrief introduction and examples for how to use ConIII is available. Thenotebook is also installed into your package directory if you used pip.To use the notebook, install jupyter such as by following the setup instructions above. Then, copy the notebook file &quot;usage_guide.ipynb&quot; into a directory outside the &quot;coniii&quot; directory. Change to this directory and run```bash$ jupyter notebook```This should open the notebook in your default web browser.## TroubleshootingThis package is only maintained for Python 3 and has only been tested for Python3.10. Check which version of Python you are running in your terminal with ```bash$ python --version```ConIII has been tested on the following systems* Ubuntu 20.04.5Trouble compiling the Boost extension manually? Check if your Boost library isincluded in your path. If it is not, then you can add an include directory entryinto the `EXTRA_COMPILE_ARGS` variable in &quot;setup.py&quot; before compiling.### SupportPlease file an issue on the GitHub if you have any problems or feature requests. Provide astack trace or other information that would be helpful in debugging. For example, OS,system configuration details, and the results of unit tests. Unit tests can be run bynavigating to the package directory and running```bash$ pytest -q```The package directory can be found by running inside python```python&gt;&gt;&gt; import coniii&gt;&gt;&gt; coniii.__path__```You may also need to install pytest.```bash$ conda install -c conda-forge pytest```### UpdatingWhen updating, please read the [RELEASE_NOTES](https://github.com/eltrompetero/coniii/blob/py3/RELEASE_NOTES). There maybe modifications to the interface including parameter names as we make future versionsmore user friendly.[Documentation](https://eddielee.co/coniii/index.html &quot;Documentation&quot;).</longdescription>
