I couldn't find any python package that does this easily. Using the[`faker`](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) library, I created this package tomake a highly configurable markdown post generator. Additionally, it alsoprovides an API for creating markdown files using python.## Getting StartedThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on yourlocal machine for development and testing purposes.### InstallingYou must have `python` and `pip` installed on your system, and in you `PATH`.An activated virtual environment is also recommended.Using `pip`:```bashpip install mdgen```Or using poetry:```bashpoetry add mdgen```## Sample usage```pythonfrom faker import Fakerfrom mdgen import MarkdownPostProviderfake = Faker()fake.add_provider(MarkdownPostProvider)fake_post = fake.post(size='medium') # available sizes: 'small', 'medium', 'large'print(fake_post)```The output from the above command:```txtDrop question writer.&gt; After step respond support argue issue western movie.[First memory suffer yard.](https://www.simmons.com/)        1.

To install alldependencies, ensure you have [`poetry`][1] installed on your system and then run:```bashpoetry install```This will install all dependencies for testing this project in a virtualenvironment. Then run all tests using:```bashpoetry shellpytest```To see test coverage, run:```bashpytest --cov --cov-report=html --cache-clear```Then open `htmlcov/index.html` in your browser to see the test coverage.### Coding styleThis project follows the [pep8](https://pep8.org/) specifications. The maximumline length has been increased to 90 characters. For the flake8 configurationused, see [tox.ini](tox.ini). The test suite automatically runs the linters bydefault, but you can run just the linting tests.```bashflake8```## Built With- [Poetry][1] - Dependency Management- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) - Used to generate this project's  documentation.## ContributingPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on our code ofconduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.## VersioningWe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.## Author- [IgnisDa](https://github.com/IgnisDa/) (**Diptesh Choudhuri**) - _Initial  work_See also the list of [contributors](contributors.md) who participated in this project.
