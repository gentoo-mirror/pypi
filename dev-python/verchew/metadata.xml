	<longdescription># Overview&gt; ...chews through your system dependencies, spitting out incompatible versions.When onboarding new team members, ensuring their computer has everything needed to work on the project can be painful. Verchew is a command-line program and embeddable Python script to check the versions of your project's system dependencies. Its only external dependency is any Python interpreter, which should already be installed on macOS and most Linux-based operating systems.[![Travis CI](https://img.shields.io/travis/com/jacebrowning/verchew/main.svg?label=unix)](https://app.travis-ci.com/jacebrowning/verchew)[![AppVeyor](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/jacebrowning/verchew/main.svg?label=windows)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jacebrowning/verchew)[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/jacebrowning/verchew/main.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/jacebrowning/verchew)[![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://img.shields.io/scrutinizer/g/jacebrowning/verchew.svg)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/jacebrowning/verchew/?branch=main)[![PyPI License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/verchew.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/verchew)[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/verchew.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/verchew)[![PyPI Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/verchew.svg?color=orange)](https://pypistats.org/packages/verchew)# Setup## Requirements- Python 2.7+ or Python 3.3+## InstallationInstall `verchew` globally with [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/installation/) (or pip):```text$ pipx install verchew```or add it to your [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) project:```text$ poetry add verchew```or embedded the script in your project using [this guide](https://verchew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/vendoring/).# UsageRun `verchew --init` to generate a sample configuration file.Update this file (`verchew.ini`) to include your project's system dependencies:```ini[Working Program]cli = working-programversion = 1.2[Newer Working Program]cli = working-programversion =  4.1 || 4.2message = Version 4.x is required to get the special features.[Broken Program]cli = broken-programversion = 1.2.3[Optional Missing Program]cli = missing-programversion = 1.2.3optional = true[Missing Program]cli = missing-programversion = 1.2.3```Run `verchew` to see if you have the expected versions installed:```text$ verchewChecking for Working Program...$ working-program --version1.2.3✔ MATCHED: 1.2Checking for Newer Working Program...$ working-program --version1.2.3✘ EXPECTED: 4.1 || 4.2䷉ MESSAGE: Version 4.x is required to get the special features.Checking for Broken Program...$ broken-program --versionAn error occurred.✘ EXPECTED: 1.2.3Checking for Optional Missing Program...$ missing-program --versionsh: command not found: missing-program▴ EXPECTED (OPTIONAL): 1.2.3Checking for Missing Program...$ missing-program --versionsh: command not found: missing-program✘ EXPECTED: 1.2.3Results: ✔ ✘ ✘ ▴ ✘```</longdescription>
