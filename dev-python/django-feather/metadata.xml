	<longdescription># Django FeatherA simple Tag (`{% icon &quot;name&quot; %}`) to implement [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com) in Django.## InstallInstall `django-feather` using `pip` and put it into your `INSTALLED_APPS`:```bashpip install django-feather```  `settings.py`:```pythonINSTALLED_APPS = [    # ...    'django_feather',    # ...]```## UsageAfter installation, the tag can be used just like any other tag:```djangotemplate{% load icon %}&lt;p&gt;Using a string {% icon &quot;coffee&quot; class=&quot;css-class&quot; height=&quot;8&quot; width=&quot;8&quot; %}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a variable {% icon self.icon class=&quot;css-class&quot; height=&quot;8&quot; width=&quot;8&quot; %}&lt;/p&gt;```The `icon` tag will simply take the SVG source from the Feather project,apply additional attributes and return the SVG tag.## TestingThere are a few tests in the `tests` directory that should test thebasic functions of this module. However, as these tests require thepackage to be build (so that the `django_feather.icons` module ispopulated), there are a few important steps to testing:```shell# Start by building the projectpython setup.py build# There should now be a build/lib directory present# Make sure that django, pytest and pytest-django are installed:pip install django pytest pytest-django# Run the testsexport DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=tests.settingsPYTHONPATH=build/lib:./ pytest tests ```The environment variable `PYTHONPATH` ensures that `django_feather` isnot imported from the current directory but rather from the `build/lib`directory.## Performance`django-feather` does not read the `.svg` files each time an icon is rendered.Instead, all the icons are written to a `.py` file upon build, just like the JavaScriptlibrary.  However, other than the JavaScript library, icons are rendered on the server side.This avoids having to call `feather.replace()` after the page has loaded.  ## LicenseFeather is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/colebemis/feather/blob/master/LICENSE).`django-feather` is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0:    Copyright 2019-2021 Jonas Drotleff &lt;j.drotleff@desk-lab.de&gt;    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;);    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
