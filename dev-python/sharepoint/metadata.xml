	<longdescription>python-sharepoint=================A Python library and command-line utility for gettting data out of SharePoint.If you're more a Perl person, you might also want to try `SharePerltopus&lt;https://github.com/cgutteridge/SharePerltopus&gt;`_.Installation------------Either install the latest development from ``git``::   $ git clone git://github.com/ox-it/python-sharepoint.git   $ cd python-sharepoint   $ sudo python setup.py install... or, install the latest stable version using ``pip``::   $ pip install sharepointYou will need `lxml &lt;http://lxml.de/&gt;`_, which you can install using yourpackage manager or ``pip``. Run one of the following if it's not alreadyinstalled::   $ sudo apt-get install python-lxml  # Debian, Ubuntu   $ sudo yum install python-lxml      # RedHat, Fedora   $ sudo pip install lxml             # pipUsage-----First, you need to create a ``SharePointSite`` object. We'll assume you'reusing basic auth; if you're not, you'll need to create an appropriate `urllib2Opener &lt;http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.build_opener&gt;`_yourself... code::   from sharepoint import SharePointSite, basic_auth_opener   server_url = &quot;http://sharepoint.example.org/&quot;   site_url = server_url + &quot;sites/foo/bar&quot;   opener = basic_auth_opener(server_url, &quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)   site = SharePointSite(site_url, opener)Lists~~~~~First, get a list of SharePoint lists available::   for sp_list in site.lists:       print sp_list.id, sp_list.meta['Title']You can look up lists by ID, or by name::   # By ID, without braces   print site.lists['1EF5668C-0AB4-4020-98EF-26325E412C3C']   # By ID, with braces   print site.lists['{1EF5668C-0AB4-4020-98EF-26325E412C3C}']   # By name   print site.lists['ListName']Given a list, you can iterate over its rows::   sp_list = site.lists['ListName']   for row in sp_list.rows:       print row.id, row.FieldName``rows`` is a list, which doesn't help you if you want to find rows by theirSharePoint row IDs. For this use a list's ``rows_by_id`` attribute, whichcontains a mapping from row ID to row.You can assign to fields as one would expect. Values will be coerced inmostly-sensible ways. Once you're done, you'll want to sync your changesusing the list's ``save()`` method::   sp_list = site.lists['ListName']      # Set both the URL and the text   sp_list.rows[5].Web_x0020_site = {'url': 'http://example.org/',                                     'text': 'Example Website'}   # Set the URL; leave the text blank   sp_list.rows[6].Web_x0020_site = 'http://example.org/'   # Clear the field   sp_list.rows[7].Web_x0020_site = None      sp_list.save()Consult the ``descriptor_set()`` methods in ``sharepoint.lists.types`` modulefor more information about setting SharePoint list fields.Document libraries~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Support for document libraries is limited, but ``SharePointListRow`` objects dosupport a ``is_file()`` method and an ``open()`` method for accessing filedata.Command-line utility~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Here's how to get a list of lists from a SharePoint site::   $ sharepoint lists -s http://sharepoint.example.org/sites/foo/bar \                -u username -p passwordAnd here's how to get one or more lists as XML::   $ sharepoint exportlists -s http://sharepoint.example.org/sites/foo/bar \                -l FirstListName -l &quot;Second List Name&quot; \                -u username -p passwordYou can also specify a file containing username and password in the format'username:password'::   $ sharepoint --credentials=path/to/credentials [...]If you want to manipulate SharePoint sites from a Python shell, use the``shell`` command::   $ sharepoint shell -s http://sharepoint.example.org/sites/foo/bar \                -u username -p passwordOnce you're in the Python shell, there will be a ``site`` variable for thesite you specified. See above for things to do with your site.For help (including to see more options to configure the output, use ``-h``::   $ sharepoint -h</longdescription>
