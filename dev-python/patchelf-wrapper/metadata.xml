It's intended for use with PyPI-hosted Python projects thatdepend on patchelf. If you're an end-user of patchelf, you should lookelsewhere! (Perhaps your OS's package manager?)Currently, patchelf-wrapper installs **patchelf 0.11**.Usage-----Ordinarily, you'll just want to set ``'patchelf-wrapper'`` as one ofyour requirements (e.g. in ``setup.py``).
