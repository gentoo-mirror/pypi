	<longdescription># PDFStitcherPDFSticher is a utility for stitching together many PDF pages from one document into a single page. This is also called &quot;N-Up&quot; or page imposition. This program was created in order to convert sewing patterns into a convenient format for projecting, though it could be used to stitch together any PDF.Since version 0.4, it is also possible to select layers for inclusion/exclusion in the final output. Additionally, line properties can be modified for each layer if the input PDF is compatible.For up-to-date information, also check out https://www.pdfstitcher.org.## Download the latest release* [Windows (7 or 10, 64-bit)](https://github.com/cfcurtis/pdfstitcher/releases/latest/download/pdfstitcher.exe)* [macOS - Intel Processor](https://github.com/cfcurtis/pdfstitcher/releases/latest/download/PDFStitcher-InstallerX64.dmg)* [macOS - M1/M2 Processor](https://github.com/cfcurtis/pdfstitcher/releases/latest/download/PDFStitcher-InstallerARM64.dmg)* &lt;a href='https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.cfcurtis.pdfstitcher'&gt;&lt;img width='120' alt='Download on Flathub' src='https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.svg'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;* Using pip: `pip install pdfstitcher` **Note: Requires Python &lt;= 3.11**.
