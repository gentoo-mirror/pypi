	<longdescription># Getting StartedPlanekit helps you create powerful apps for **fixed-wing** UAVs. These apps run on a UAVâ€™s Companion Computer, and augment the autopilot by performing tasks that are both computationally intensive and require a low-latency link.This documentation provides everything you need to get started with Planekit, including an overview of the API, quick start, guide material, a number of demos and examples, and API Reference.## Install Planekit```pip install planekit```# Start simulation anywhere or connect UAV:Plankit does not include any built-in simulation. Therefore, you must connect the planekit still or an arduplane installed UAV.A simple example of starting a still with Mission planar![image info](https://aybars-510d8.web.app/assets/images/Misson_plannar-4d87924f4fe68d22243335134c90184b.png)Planekit supports other alternatives. (Mavproxy etc.)## First connectionYou can see the first connection example below.```jsx title=&quot;commonly_used_data&quot;import timeimport planekitvehicle = planekit.Connection(&quot;tcp:127.0.0.1:5762&quot;)vehicle.wait_heartbeat()print(&quot;connection is successful&quot;)```# See Docshttps://plane-kit.com/</longdescription>
