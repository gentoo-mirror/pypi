After this date,only critical patches (security and core bug fixes) will be accepted, and theproject will be in &quot;critical-only&quot; mode for another six months (until November30, 2021). For more information visit the FAQ at &lt;https://kytos.io/faq&gt;. We'llhave eternal gratitude to the entire community of developers and users that madethe project so far.**`Kytos SDN Platform &lt;https://kytos.io&gt;`_ is the fastest way to deploy an SDNNetwork. With this you can deploy a basic OpenFlow controller or your owncontroller. Kytos was designed to be easy to install, use, develop and shareNetwork Apps (NApps). Kytos is incredibly powerful and easy, its modular designmakes Kytos a lightweight SDN Platform.Kytos is conceived to ease SDN controllers development and deployment. It wasmotivated by some gaps left by common SDN solutions. Moreover, it has strongtights with a community view, so it is centered on the development ofapplications by its users. Thus, our intention is not only to build a new SDNsolution, but also to build a community of developers around it, creating newapplications that benefit from the SDN paradigm.The project was born in 2014 and has been under active development since2016.For more information about this project, please visit `Kytos project website&lt;https://kytos.io/&gt;`_...
