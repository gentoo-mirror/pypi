	<longdescription># idpmodemPython library and samples for integrating with satellite Internet-of-Things modems using the [Inmarsat](https://www.inmarsat.com) IsatData Pro (&quot;IDP&quot;)network.[Documentation](https://inmarsat-enterprise.github.io/idpmodem/)## OverviewIDP is a store-and-forward satellite messaging technology withmessages up to 6400 bytes mobile-originated or 10000 bytes mobile-terminated.*Messages* are sent from or to a *Mobile* using its globally unique ID,transacted through a *Mailbox* that provides authentication, encryption anddata segregation for cloud-based or enterprise client applications via anetwork **Messaging API**.The first byte of the message is referred to as the*Service Identification Number* (**SIN**) where values below 16 are reservedfor system use.  SIN is intended to capture the concept of embeddedmicroservices used by an application.The second byte of the message can optionally be defined as the*Message Identifier Number* (**MIN**) intended to support remote operations within each embedded microservice with defined binary formatting.The MIN concept also supports the optional *Message Definition File* featureallowing an XML file to be applied which presents a JSON-tagged messagestructure on the network API.### Terminology* MO = **Mobile Originated** aka *Return* aka *From-Mobile*  message sent from modem to cloud/enterprise application* MT = **Mobile Terminated** aka *Forward message* aka *To-Mobile*  message sent from cloud/enterprise application to modem## Modem operationUpon power-up or reset, the modem first acquires its location using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS).After getting its location, the modem tunes to the correct frequency, thenregisters on the Inmarsat network.  Once registered it can communicate on thenetwork.Prolonged obstruction of satellite signal will put the modem into a &quot;blockage&quot;state from which it will automatically try to recover based on an algorithminfluenced by its *power mode* setting.</longdescription>
