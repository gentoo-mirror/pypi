It provides modular utility for one-off operating system deploymentwith as few operational requirements as reasonably possible.The mission of bifrost is to provide an easy path to deploy ironic ina stand-alone fashion, in order to help facilitate the deployment ofinfrastucture, while also being a configurable project that can consumeother OpenStack components to allow users to easily customize theenvironment to fit their needs, and drive forward the stand-aloneperspective.Use cases include:* Installation of ironic in standalone/noauth mode without other OpenStack  components.* Deployment of an operating system to a known pool of hardware as  a batch operation.* Testing and development of ironic in the standalone mode... _ironic: https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/Useful Links~~~~~~~~~~~~Bifrost's documentation can be found at:  https://docs.openstack.org/bifrost/latestRelease notes are at:  https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/bifrost/The project source code repository is located at:  https://opendev.org/openstack/bifrost/Bugs can be filed in launchpad:  https://launchpad.net/bifrost</longdescription>
