	<longdescription>.. django-postman documentation master file, created by   sphinx-quickstart on Fri Nov 26 09:32:49 2010.   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least   contain the root `toctree` directive.Welcome to django-postman's documentation!==========================================This is an application for `Django &lt;https://www.djangoproject.com&gt;`_-powered websites.A list of available translations is maintained in the `Wiki &lt;https://bitbucket.org/psam/django-postman/wiki/&gt;`_.Your contribution to the translations is welcomed `here &lt;https://www.transifex.com/psam/django-postman/&gt;`_.Basically, the purpose is to allow authenticated users of a site to exchange private **messages**within the site.  In this documentation, the word *user* is to be understood as an instance of a User,in the django.contrib.auth context.So it is mainly for a User-to-User exchange.But it may be beneficial for a subscriber to receive inquiries from any visitor, ie even if non authenticated.For instance, a subscriber as a service provider wants an ask-me-details form on a presentation pageto facilitate possible business contacts.In this case, the visitor is presented a compose message form with an additional field to givean email address for the reply. The email is obfuscated to the recipient.What is a message ? Roughly a piece of text, about a subject, sent by a sender to a recipient.Each user has access to a collection of messages, stored in folders:* **Inbox** for incoming messages* **Sent** for sent messages* **Archives** for archived messages* **Trash** for messages marked as deletedIn folders, messages can be presented in two modes:* by **conversation**, for a compact view: the original message and its replies are grouped in a set  to constitute one sole entry.  The lastest message (based on the time) is the representative of the set.* by **message**, for an expanded view: each message is considered by itself.Here is a summary of features:* A non-User (email is undisclosed) can write to a User and get a reply  (can be disabled by configuration)* Exchanges can be moderated (with auto-accept and auto-reject plug-ins)* Optional recipient filter plug-ins* Optional exchange filtering plug-ins (blacklists)* Multi-recipient writing is possible (can be disabled by configuration)  with min/max constraints* Messages are managed by conversations* Messages in folders are sortable by sender|recipient|subject|date* 'Archives' folder in addition to classic Inbox, Sent and Trash folders* A Quick-Reply form to only ask for a response text* A cleanup management command to clear the old deleted messagesIt has support for optional additional applications:* Autocomplete recipient field (default is 'django-ajax-selects'),  with multiple recipient management* New message notification (default is `pinax-notifications`_)* Asynchronous mailer (default is `django-mailer`_).. _`pinax-notifications`: https://github.com/pinax/pinax-notifications/.. _`django-mailer`: https://github.com/pinax/django-mailer/Moderation----------As an option, messages may need to be validated by a moderator before to be visibleto the recipient.  Possible usages are:* to control there is no unwanted words in the text fields.* to make sure that no direct contact informations are exchanged when the site is an intermediary  and delivers services based on subscription fees.Messages are first created in a *pending* state. A moderator is in charge to change them toa *rejected* or *accepted* state.  This operation can be done in two ways:* By a person, through the Admin site. A specially simplified change view is provided,  with one-click buttons to accept or reject the message.* Automatically, through one or more auto-moderator functions.Filters-------As options, custom filters can disallow messages, in two ways:* **user filter**: a user is not in a state to act as a recipient* **exchange filter**: criteria for a message between a specific sender  and a specific recipient are not fulfilled</longdescription>
