	<longdescription># empanada-napari**The preprint describing this work is now available [on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.17.484806v1).****Documentation for the plugin, including more detailed installation instructions, can be found [here](https://empanada.readthedocs.io/en/latest/empanada-napari.html).**[empanada](https://github.com/volume-em/empanada) is a tool for deep learning-based panoptic segmentation of 2D and 3D electron microscopy images of cells.This plugin allows the running of panoptic segmentation models trained in empanada within [napari](https://napari.org).For help with this plugin please open an [issue](https://github.com/volume-em/empanada-napari/issues), for issues with napari specificallyraise an [issue here instead](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues).## Implemented Models  - *MitoNet*: A generalist mitochondrial instance segmentation model.## Example DatasetsVolume EM datasets for benchmarking mitochondrial instance segmentation are available from[EMPIAR-10982](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/EMPIAR-10982/).## InstallationIt's recommended to have installed napari through [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).Then to install this plugin:```shellpip install empanada-napari```Launch napari:```shellnapari```Look for empanada-napari under the &quot;Plugins&quot; menu.![empanada](images/demo.gif)## GPU Support**Note: Mac doesn't support NVIDIA GPUS. This section only applies to Windows and Linux systems.**As for any deep learning models, having a GPU installed on your system will significantlyincrease model throughput (although we ship CPU optimized versions of all models with the plugin).This plugin relies on torch for running models. If a GPU was found on your system, then you will see that the&quot;Use GPU&quot; checkbox is checked by default in the &quot;2D Inference&quot; and &quot;3D Inference&quot; plugin widgets. Or if when runninginference you see a message that says &quot;Using CPU&quot; in the terminal that means a GPU is not being used.Make sure that GPU drivers are correctly installed. In terminal or command prompt:```shellnvidia-smi```If this returns &quot;command not found&quot; then you need to [install the driver from NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx). Instead, ifif the driver is installed correctly, you may need to switch to the GPU enabled version of torch.First, uninstall the current version of torch:```shellpip uninstall torch```Then [install torch &gt;= 1.10 using conda for your system](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).This command should work:```shellconda install pytorch cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch```## Citing this workIf you use results generated by this plugin in a publication, please cite:```bibtex@article {Conrad2022.03.17.484806,author = {Conrad, Ryan and Narayan, Kedar},title = {Instance segmentation of mitochondria in electron microscopy images with a generalist deep learning model},elocation-id = {2022.03.17.484806},year = {2022},doi = {10.1101/2022.03.17.484806},publisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},URL = {https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/03/18/2022.03.17.484806},eprint = {https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2022/03/18/2022.03.17.484806.full.pdf},journal = {bioRxiv}}```</longdescription>
