Helga originally startedas a python fork of a perl-based IRC bot `olga`_, but has grown considerably since then. Earlyversions limited to support to IRC, but now include other services like XMPP and HipChat.Full documentation can be found at http://helga.readthedocs.org.Supported Backends------------------As of version 1.7.0, helga supports IRC, XMPP, and HipChat out of the box. Note, however, thathelga originally started as an IRC bot, so much of the terminology will reflect that. The currentstatus of XMPP and HipChat support is very limited and somewhat beta. In the future, helga mayhave a much more robust and pluggable backend system to allow connections to any number of chatservices.Contributing------------Contributions are **always** welcomed, whether they be in the form of bug fixes, enhancements,or just bug reports.
