	<longdescription># adventurelib[![Build](https://travis-ci.org/lordmauve/adventurelib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lordmauve/adventurelib)[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/adventurelib/badge/?version=latest)](https://adventurelib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)`adventurelib` provides basic functionality for writing text-based adventuregames, with the aim of making it easy enough for young teenagers to do.The foundation of adventurelib is the ability to define functions that arecalled in response to commands. For example, you could write a function tobe called when the user types commands like &quot;take hat&quot;:    @when('take THING')    def take(thing):        print(f'You take the {thing}.')        inventory.append(thing)It also includes the foundations needed to write games involving rooms, items,characters and more... but users will have to implement these features forthemselves as they explore Python programming concepts.## Installing`adventurelib.py` is a single file that can be copied into your project. Youcan also install it with pip:    pip install adventurelib## Documentation[Comprehensive documentation is on Read The Docs.](http://adventurelib.readthedocs.io/)</longdescription>
