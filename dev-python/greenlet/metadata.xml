This file is included into docs/history.rst.. image:: https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/workflows/tests/badge.svg   :target: https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/actionsGreenlets are lightweight coroutines for in-process concurrentprogramming.The &quot;greenlet&quot; package is a spin-off of `Stackless`_, a version ofCPython that supports micro-threads called &quot;tasklets&quot;. Tasklets runpseudo-concurrently (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads)and are synchronized with data exchanges on &quot;channels&quot;.A &quot;greenlet&quot;, on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion ofmicro-thread with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other words.This is useful when you want to control exactly when your code runs.You can build custom scheduled micro-threads on top of greenlet;however, it seems that greenlets are useful on their own as a way tomake advanced control flow structures. For example, we can recreategenerators; the difference with Python's own generators is that ourgenerators can call nested functions and the nested functions canyield values too. (Additionally, you don't need a &quot;yield&quot; keyword. Seethe example in `test_generator.py&lt;https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/blob/adca19bf1f287b3395896a8f41f3f4fd1797fdc7/src/greenlet/tests/test_generator.py#L1&gt;`_).Greenlets are provided as a C extension module for the regular unmodifiedinterpreter... _`Stackless`: http://www.stackless.comWho is using Greenlet?======================There are several libraries that use Greenlet as a more flexiblealternative to Python's built in coroutine support: - `Concurrence`_ - `Eventlet`_ - `Gevent`_.. _Concurrence: http://opensource.hyves.org/concurrence/.. _Eventlet: http://eventlet.net/.. _Gevent: http://www.gevent.org/Getting Greenlet================The easiest way to get Greenlet is to install it with pip::  pip install greenletSource code archives and binary distributions are available on thepython package index at https://pypi.org/project/greenletThe source code repository is hosted on github:https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenletDocumentation is available on readthedocs.org:https://greenlet.readthedocs.io</longdescription>
