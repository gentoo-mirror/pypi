	<longdescription>clipboard=========A cross platform clipboard operation library of Python. Works for Windows, Mac and Linux.Well, as I was trying to implement this, I realize that everything is included in pyperclip already: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyperclip/But anyway, `clipboard` is a better name. You are free to choose:-) I might add more features to it.Usage:::   import clipboard   clipboard.copy(&quot;abc&quot;)  # now the clipboard content will be string &quot;abc&quot;   text = clipboard.paste()  # text will have the content of clipboard</longdescription>
