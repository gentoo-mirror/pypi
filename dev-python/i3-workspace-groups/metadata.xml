	<longdescription># i3 Workspace GroupsA Python library and set of command line tools for managing i3wm workspaces in groupsthat you define.I find this tool useful for managing many workspaces in i3.[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/i3-workspace-groups.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/i3-workspace-groups)[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/infokiller/i3-workspace-groups/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/infokiller/i3-workspace-groups/commits/master)![Demo flow](./assets/demo.gif?raw=true)## Table of Contents- [Background](#background)- [Installation](#installation)- [Configuration](#configuration)  - [i3 config](#i3-config)  - [i3-workspace-groups configuration file](#i3-workspace-groups-configuration-file)- [Usage](#usage)  - [Example walk through](#example-walk-through)- [Concepts](#concepts)  - [Active workspace](#active-workspace)  - [Active group](#active-group)  - [Focused group](#focused-group)  - [Default group](#default-group)- [Limitations](#limitations)  - [Sway compatibility](#sway-compatibility)## BackgroundI often find myself working with many i3 workspaces at once (7-8+), usuallyrelated to multiple projects/contexts (personal/work etc). This has caused me afew issues, for example:- Working with a set of workspaces of a given project/context, without being  distracted by unrelated workspaces.- Reusing the same workspace number in multiple projects/contexts. For example,  I have two different emails for personal and work stuff, and I want `Super+1`  to always switch to the workspace with the email client relevant to my current  context.- Finding a free workspace for a new window (that can also be reached with my  keybindings)This has led me to create the [i3-workspace-groups](https://github.com/infokiller/i3-workspace-groups)project, which enables you to define and manage groups of workspaces, each withtheir own &quot;namespace&quot;, and switch between them.## InstallationThe scripts can be installed using pip:```shellpython3 -m pip install i3-workspace-groups```Then you should be able to run the command line tool[`i3-workspace-groups`](scripts/i3-workspace-groups).There are also a few utility scripts provided that require[rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) and which are useful forinteractively managing the groups, using rofi as the UI. They include:- [`i3-assign-workspace-to-group`](scripts/i3-assign-workspace-to-group)- [`i3-focus-on-workspace`](scripts/i3-focus-on-workspace)- [`i3-move-to-workspace`](scripts/i3-move-to-workspace)- [`i3-rename-workspace`](scripts/i3-rename-workspace)- [`i3-switch-active-workspace-group`](scripts/i3-switch-active-workspace-group)## Configuration### i3 configIn order to use these tools effectively, commands need to be bound tokeybindings. For example, my i3 config contains the following exerts:&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable fenced-code-language --&gt;```set $mod Mod4set $exec_i3_groups exec --no-startup-id i3-workspace-groups# Switch active workspace groupbindsym $mod+g exec --no-startup-id i3-switch-active-workspace-group# Assign workspace to a groupbindsym $mod+Shift+g exec --no-startup-id i3-assign-workspace-to-group# Select workspace to focus onbindsym $mod+w exec --no-startup-id i3-focus-on-workspace# Move the focused container to another workspacebindsym $mod+Shift+w exec --no-startup-id i3-move-to-workspace# Rename/renumber workspace.

Note that the active  group is not necessarily the same as the [focused group](#focused-group).- Navigation and movement within a group while ignoring the other groups. See  examples below.The tools provided use i3 workspace names to store and read the group for eachworkspace. For example, if a user assigns the workspace &quot;mail&quot; to the group&quot;work&quot;, it will be renamed to &quot;work:mail&quot;.### Example walk through&gt; **NOTE:** This walk through assumes that you configured keybindings like the&gt; [example i3 config](#i3-config).Say we start with the following workspace names:1. &quot;1&quot; with cat videos from YouTube.2. &quot;2&quot; with a news reader.3. &quot;3&quot; with a photo editor.4. &quot;4&quot; with an email client for work.An important thing to understand here is that every i3 workspace is alwaysassigned to a single group. And since we haven't assigned any workspace to agroup yet, all the workspaces are implicitly in the[default group](#default-group), which is denoted as &quot;&amp;lt;default&gt;&quot;.After a few hours of leisure time, you decide to do some work, which requiresopening a few windows on a few workspaces. In order to create a new group, firstyou switch to the workspace &quot;4&quot;, and then you press `Super+Shift+g`, which willprompt you for a group to assign to the current workspace. You type &quot;work&quot; andpress enter. Since there's no group named &quot;work&quot; yet, the tool will create itand assign the focused workspace to it. You will then notice that theworkspace name will change in i3bar to &quot;work:4&quot;.Then, you press `Super+g` in order to switch the [activegroup](#active-group). You will be shown a list of existing groups, which willnow be &quot;work&quot; and &quot;&amp;lt;default&gt;&quot;.You should now see your workspaces in i3bar ordered as following:&quot;work:4&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;.What happened here?When you switched to the &quot;work&quot; group, the first thing that the tool did was tomove all the workspaces in the work group (only &quot;work:mail&quot;) to be in thebeginning of the workspace list. Then, it renamed the workspaces in the defaultgroup to include the group name, so that they can be differentiated from otherworkspaces in the &quot;work&quot; group with the same name.Then, you decide that you want to open a new terminal window in a new workspace.So you press `Super+2`, which will move you to a new workspace named &quot;work:2&quot;.Note that although there is already a workspace with the name &quot;2&quot; in the defaultgroup (now shown as &quot;2&quot; in the workspace list), using `Super+2` actually takesyou to a new empty workspace in the group &quot;work&quot;.After some time working, you become lazy and you want to get back to cat videos,but you promise yourself to get back to work in a few hours, and you don't wantto lose your open windows. So you press `Super+g` to switch the active work backto the default one. You should now see your workspaces in i3bar ordered asfollowing: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;work:4&quot;. The focus will also shift to the firstworkspace in the default group (&quot;1&quot; in this case).Now that you're back in the default group, pressing `Super+2` will again leadyou to the workspace &quot;2&quot; in the default group.## Concepts### Active workspaceThe active workspace is the workspace with the lowest number in i3. Typically,before you use the provided scripts to manage you workspaces, this will be theone that appears first in the workspace list in i3bar (by default the leftmostone).&gt; **NOTE:** In a multi-monitor setup, there is an active workspace per monitor.&gt;&gt; **NOTE:** The active workspace is not affected by whether its focused or not.### Active groupThe active group is the group of the [active workspace](#active-workspace).This group will normally contain workspaces related to the task you're doing atthe time it's active. When you want to work on another task, you can switch theactive group.Workspaces that are not in the active group can still be interacted with, butsome commands provided are designed to make it easier to interact with theworkspaces of the active group.&gt; **NOTE:** In a multi-monitor setup, there is an active group per monitor (which&gt; can be the same, depending on the group of the active workspace in that&gt; monitor).### Focused groupThe group of the focused workspace.### Default groupThe group of workspaces that were not assigned to a group by the user. Thisgroup is usually displayed as &quot;&amp;lt;default&gt;&quot;.## Limitations- **Interaction with other i3 tools**: workspace names are used for storing the  group, so if another tool changes a workspace name without preserving the  format that this project uses, the tool can make a mistake about the group  assignment.- **Latency**: there can be noticeable latency in some machines for the script  commands. On my high performance desktop this is not noticeable, but on my  laptop it is. I measured the latency of commands to be around 100-200 ms,  most of it coming from importing python libraries, so it's not possible to  reduce it much without running it as a daemon (which will overcomplicate  things). In the long term, I'm considering rewriting it in go.- **Number of workspaces/groups/monitors**: Supports up to 10 monitors, each  containing up to 100 groups, each containing up to 100 workspaces.### Sway compatibilityThis project depends on [i3ipc](https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-python) for itsinteraction with i3, so should also work the same on sway. That said, I didn'ttest it yet and i3 is my main window manager.</longdescription>
