	<longdescription># PHC SDK for PythonThe phc-sdk-py is a developer kit for interfacing with the [PHC API](https://api.docs.lifeomic.com/) on Python 3.7 and above.## Project Status![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/lifeomic/phc-sdk-py.svg?style=for-the-badge)![PyPI status](https://img.shields.io/pypi/status/phc.svg?style=for-the-badge)![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dw/phc?style=for-the-badge)![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/lifeomic/phc-sdk-py.svg?style=for-the-badge)[![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOCS-PASSING-green?style=for-the-badge)](https://lifeomic.github.io/phc-sdk-py/)[![User Guides](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOCS-PASSING-green?style=for-the-badge)](https://devcenter.docs.lifeomic.com/guides/python-sdk)## Getting Started### Dependencies- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) version &gt;= 3.8### Getting the SourceThis project is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/lifeomic/phc-sdk-py). You can clone this project directly using this command:```bashgit clone git@github.com:lifeomic/phc-sdk-py.git```### DevelopmentPython environments are managed using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). Be sure to have this installed first `pip install virtualenv`. The makefile will setup the environment for the targets listed below.Some clients in this SDK are auto-generated. They can be re-generated at any time to pull in the latest changes by running `make gen`.#### SetupThis installs some pre-commit hooks that will format and lint new changes.```bashmake setup```#### Running tests```bashmake test```#### Linting```bashmake lint```### Installation```bashpip install phc```### UsageA `Session` needs to be created first that stores the token and account information needed to access the PHC API. One can currently using API Key tokens generated from the PHC Account, or OAuth tokens generated using the [CLI](https://github.com/lifeomic/cli).```pythonfrom phc import Sessionsession = Session(token=&lt;TOKEN VALUE&gt;, account=&quot;myaccount&quot;)```Once a `Session` is created, you can then access the different parts of the platform.```pythonfrom phc.services import Accountsaccounts = Accounts(session)myaccounts = accounts.get_list()```## Release Process[Releases](https://github.com/lifeomic/phc-sdk-py/releases) are generally created with each merged PR. To release a new version, update the package version in `phc.version`, and open a PR.Packages for each release are published to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/phc/). See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes.### VersioningThis project uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).## ContributingWe encourage public contributions!
