	<longdescription># BCP&lt; badges will go here &gt;**This is a python utility that allows users to import/export data to/from a database.**---# OverviewThis library began as a wrapper around SQL Server's BCP utility. It makes some assumptionsabout parameters to simplify the interface and allow the user to work natively in python.Though it currently supports MSSQL, there are plans to extend support to other database dialects.# Requirements- Python 3.6+This library purposely requires no python packages outside of the standard library, beyond testing and documentationneeds. The intention is to maintain this status. However, you will need to have the appropriate command line utilitiesinstalled for the specific database dialects with which you'll interact. For example, if your database is a MS SQLSERVER instance, you'll need BCP installed. Consult the table below for further documentation, including download filesand instructions.| RDBMS         | Utility | Documentation / Installation                           ||:--------------|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------------|| MS SQL Server | BCP     | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/bcp-utility |# InstallationThis library is still in development. So you'll have to build it fromsource in the meantime. I'll soon get around to publishing it on pypi, in which case you'll be able to install it using `pip`    pip install bcp# ExamplesImport data:```pythonimport bcpconn = bcp.Connection(host='HOST', driver='mssql', username='USER', password='PASSWORD')my_bcp = bcp.BCP(conn)file = bcp.DataFile(file_path='path/to/file.csv', delimiter=',')my_bcp.load(input_file=file, table='table_name')```Export data:```pythonimport bcpconn = bcp.Connection(host='HOST', driver='mssql', username='USER', password='PASSWORD')my_bcp = bcp.BCP(conn)file = bcp.DataFile(file_path='path/to/file.csv', delimiter=',')my_bcp.dump(query='select * from sys.tables', output_file=file)```# Full DocumentationFor the full documentation, please visit: https://bcp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</longdescription>
