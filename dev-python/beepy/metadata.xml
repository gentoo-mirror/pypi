It only works under Python 3.It is intended to be used when you are running a long analysis in the background and want to know when it is ready.Example Use=============::   import beepy   beep(sound=1) # integer as argument   beep(sound='coin') # string as argumentRequirements=============Currently, ``beepy`` only runs on Python 3.``beepy`` relies on a Python package called ``simpleaudio`` which can be also be installed using:``pip install simpleaudio``.Installation=============To install, type:``pip install beepy``.Arguments---------``sound`` argument takes eitheer integers (1-7) or string (from the list below) as argument.Following are the mappings for the numbers:``1`` : ``'coin'``\ ,``2`` : ``'robot_error'``\ ,``3`` : ``'error'``\ ,``4`` : ``'ping'``\ ,``5`` : ``'ready'``\ ,``6`` : ``'success'``\ ,``7`` : ``'wilhelm'``Issues------``beepy`` is currently at  pre-alpha stage.But reports can be posted on Github at a later date.Author------* **Prabesh Dhakal** - *Initial Work*Licence-------This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md file for details.Acknowledgements----------------*   **beepr**  The main motivation behind this package is another R package by the name of ``beepr``. I could not find an equivalent for Python, so decided to make my own version of it.  You can learn more about ``beepr`` `here &lt;https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/beepr.html&gt;`_.*   **simpleaudio**  This package is built on top of another package named `simpleaudio &lt;https://github.com/hamiltron/py-simple-audio&gt;`_, and would not be possible in its absence.  While it is largely based on ``simpleaudio``\ , ``beepy`` is not meant to replace the ``simpleaudio`` package.  My sincere thanks to `hamiltron &lt;https://github.com/hamiltron/&gt;`_ for creating simpleaudio.*   **Sound Files**  All sound files used in this package come from `freesound.org &lt;https://freesound.org&gt;`_ and were `Creative Commons 0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) &lt;https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&gt;`_ licenced at the time of creation of this project.</longdescription>
