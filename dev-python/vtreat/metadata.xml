	<longdescription>[This](https://github.com/WinVector/pyvtreat) is the Python version of the `vtreat` data preparation system(also available as an [`R` package](https://winvector.github.io/vtreat/)).`vtreat` is a `DataFrame` processor/conditioner that preparesreal-world data for supervised machine learning or predictive modelingin a statistically sound manner.`vtreat` takes an input `DataFrame`that has a specified column called &quot;the outcome variable&quot; (or &quot;y&quot;)that is the quantity to be predicted (and must not have missingvalues).  Other input columns are possible explanatory variables(typically numeric or categorical/string-valued, these columns mayhave missing values) that the user later wants to use to predict &quot;y&quot;.In practice such an input `DataFrame` may not be immediately suitablefor machine learning procedures that often expect only numericexplanatory variables, and may not tolerate missing values.To solve this, `vtreat` builds a transformed `DataFrame` where allexplanatory variable columns have been transformed into a number ofnumeric explanatory variable columns, without missing values.  The`vtreat` implementation produces derived numeric columns that capturemost of the information relating the explanatory columns to thespecified &quot;y&quot; or dependent/outcome column through a number of numerictransforms (indicator variables, impact codes, prevalence codes, andmore).  This transformed `DataFrame` is suitable for a wide range ofsupervised learning methods from linear regression, through gradientboosted machines.The idea is: you can take a `DataFrame` of messy real world data andeasily, faithfully, reliably, and repeatably prepare it for machinelearning using documented methods using `vtreat`.  Incorporating`vtreat` into your machine learning workflow lets you quickly workwith very diverse structured data.Worked examples can be found [here](https://github.com/WinVector/pyvtreat/tree/master/Examples).For more detail please see here: [arXiv:1611.09477stat.AP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09477) (the documentation describes the `R` version,however all of the examples can be found worked in `Python` [here](https://github.com/WinVector/pyvtreat/tree/master/Examples/vtreat_paper1)).`vtreat` is availableas a [`Python`/`Pandas` package](https://github.com/WinVector/vtreat),and also as an [`R` package](https://github.com/WinVector/vtreat).</longdescription>
