Using C++ techniques DUNE allows to use verydifferent implementation of the same concept (i.e. grid, solver, ...) undera common interface with a very low overhead.DUNE was designed with flexibility in mind. It supports easy discretizationusing methods, like Finite Elements, Finite Volume and also FiniteDifferences.Dune-localfunctions-------------------This module provides interfaces and implementations for localfinite element ansatz spaces, i.e., shape functions, associatedinterpolation functionals, and relation to grid entities.More information----------------Check dune-common for more details concerning dependencies, known bugs,license and installation.git-3f2805875bbe5569190663c13bfcd1c49ccee7e9</longdescription>
