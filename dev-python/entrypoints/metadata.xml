	<longdescription>**This package is in maintenance-only mode.** New code should use the`importlib.metadata module &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html&gt;`_in the Python standard library to find and load entry points.Entry points are a way for Python packages to advertise objects with somecommon interface. The most common examples are ``console_scripts`` entry points,which define shell commands by identifying a Python function to run.*Groups* of entry points, such as ``console_scripts``, point to objects withsimilar interfaces. An application might use a group to find its plugins, ormultiple groups if it has different kinds of plugins.The **entrypoints** module contains functions to find and load entry points.You can install it from PyPI with ``pip install entrypoints``.To advertise entry points when distributing a package, see`entry_points in the Python Packaging User Guide&lt;https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#entry-points&gt;`_.The ``pkg_resources`` module distributed with ``setuptools`` provides a way todiscover entrypoints as well, but it contains other functionality unrelated toentrypoint discovery, and it does a lot of work at import time.  Merely*importing* ``pkg_resources`` causes it to scan the files of all installedpackages. Thus, in environments where a large number of packages are installed,importing ``pkg_resources`` can be very slow (several seconds).By contrast, ``entrypoints`` is focused solely on entrypoint discovery and itis faster. Importing ``entrypoints`` does not scan anything, and getting agiven entrypoint group performs a more focused scan.When there are multiple versions of the same distribution in differentdirectories on ``sys.path``, ``entrypoints`` follows the rule that the firstone wins.  In most cases, this follows the logic of imports.  Similarly,Entrypoints relies on ``pip`` to ensure that only one ``.dist-info`` or``.egg-info`` directory exists for each installed package.  There is no reliableway to pick which of several `.dist-info` folders accurately relates to theimportable modules.</longdescription>
