	<longdescription>sqlalchemy-sybase=================.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/sqlalchemy-sybase.svg        :target: https://pypi.org/project/sqlalchemy-sybase/SAP ASE (Sybase) dialect for SQLAlchemy.The latest version of this dialect requires SQLAlchemy 2.0 or later. To work with earlier versions of SQLAlchemy, do::    pip install sqlalchemy-sybase&lt;2.0.0Overview--------This is a fork of SQLAlchemy's internal &quot;sybase&quot; dialectwhich was deprecated in SQLAlchemy 1.4 and was removed fromSQLAlchemy 2.0.Database Version Support------------------------This dialect is tested against SAP ASE version 16. Some features may not workon earlier versions of SAP ASE.Pre-requisites--------------You will need an ODBC driver for SAP ASE installed on the machine from whichyou want to connect to the SAP ASE server. This dialect is tested withthe SAP ASE ODBC driver (``libsybdrvodb-sqllen8.so`` on Linux).Also, if you are running on Linux and using `unixODBC`_, check the version via``odbcinst -j`` from a console prompt (or use the `odbcinst`_ module).The official repositories of several Linux distributionscontain versions of unixODBC that are quite old and somewhat buggy... _unixODBC: http://www.unixodbc.org/.. _odbcinst: https://github.com/gordthompson/odbcinstInstalling----------SQLAlchemy and pyodbc are specified as requirements so ``pip`` will installthem if they are not already in place. To install, just::    pip install sqlalchemy-sybaseGetting Started---------------Create an `ODBC DSN (Data Source Name)`_ that points to your SAP ASE database.Then, in your Python app, you can connect to the database via::    from sqlalchemy import create_engine    engine = create_engine(&quot;sybase+pyodbc://scott:tiger@your_dsn&quot;)For other ways of connecting see the `Getting Connected`_ page in the Wiki... _ODBC DSN (Data Source Name): https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/966849/what-is-a-dsn-data-source-name.. _Getting Connected: https://github.com/gordthompson/sqlalchemy-sybase/wiki/Getting-ConnectedThe SQLAlchemy Project======================sqlalchemy-sybase is affiliated with the `SQLAlchemy Project &lt;https://www.sqlalchemy.org&gt;`_ andadheres to the same standards and conventions as the core project.Development / Bug reporting / Pull requests-------------------------------------------Please refer to the`SQLAlchemy Community Guide &lt;https://www.sqlalchemy.org/develop.html&gt;`_ forguidelines on coding and participating in this project.Code of Conduct_______________Above all, SQLAlchemy places great emphasis on polite, thoughtful, andconstructive communication between users and developers.Please see the current Code of Conduct at`Code of Conduct &lt;https://www.sqlalchemy.org/codeofconduct.html&gt;`_.License=======sqlalchemy-sybase is distributed under the `MIT license&lt;https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT&gt;`_.</longdescription>
