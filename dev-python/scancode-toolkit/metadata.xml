	<longdescription>================ScanCode toolkit================A typical software project often reuses hundreds of third-party packages.License and packages, dependencies and origin information is not always easy tofind and not normalized: ScanCode discovers and normalizes this data for you.Read more about ScanCode here: https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/.Check out the code at https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkitDiscover also:- The ScanCode.io server project here: https://scancodeio.readthedocs.io- The ScanCode Workbench project for visualization of scancode results data:  https://github.com/nexB/scancode-workbench - Other companion SCA projects for code origin, license and security analysis  here: https://aboutcode.orgBuild and tests status======================We run 30,000+ tests on each commit on multiple CIs to ensure a good platformcompabitility with multiple versions of Windows, Linux and macOS.+------------+--------------+-------------------------+----------------------------+| **Azure**  | **RTD Build**| **GitHub actions Docs** | **GitHub actions Release** |+============+==============+=========================+============================+|  |azure|   | |docs-rtd|   |  |docs-github-actions|  |  |release-github-actions|  |+------------+--------------+-------------------------+----------------------------+Why use ScanCode?=================- As a **standalone command-line tool**, ScanCode is **easy to install**, run,  and embed in your CI/CD processing pipeline.  It runs on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.- ScanCode is **used by several projects and organizations** such as  the `Eclipse Foundation &lt;https://www.eclipse.org&gt;`_,  `OpenEmbedded.org &lt;https://www.openembedded.org&gt;`_,  the `FSFE &lt;https://www.fsfe.org&gt;`_,  the `FSF &lt;https://www.fsf.org&gt;`_,  `OSS Review Toolkit &lt;http://oss-review-toolkit.org&gt;`_,   `ClearlyDefined.io &lt;https://clearlydefined.io/&gt;`_,  `RedHat Fabric8 analytics &lt;https://github.com/fabric8-analytics&gt;`_,  and many more.- ScanCode detects licenses, copyrights, package manifests, direct dependencies,  and more both in **source code** and **binary** files and is considered as the  best-in-class and reference tool in this domain, re-used as the core tools for  software composition data collection by several open source tools.- ScanCode provides the **most accurate license detection engine** and does a  full comparison (also known as diff or red line comparison) between a database  of license texts and your code instead of relying only on approximate regex  patterns or probabilistic search, edit distance or machine learning.- Written in Python, ScanCode is **easy to extend with plugins** to contribute  new and improved scanners, data summarization, package manifest parsers, and  new outputs.- You can save your scan results as **JSON, YAML, HTML, CycloneDX or SPDX** or  even create your own format with Jinja templates.- You can also organize and run ScanCode server-side with the  companion `ScanCode.io web app &lt;https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io&gt;`_  to organize and store multiple scan projects including scripted scanning pipelines.- ScanCode output data can be easily visualized and analysed using the  `ScanCode Workbench &lt;https://github.com/nexB/scancode-workbench&gt;`_ desktop app.- ScanCode is **actively maintained**, has a **growing users and contributors  community**.- ScanCode is heavily **tested** with an automated test suite of over **20,000 tests**.- ScanCode has an extensive and growing documentation.- ScanCode can process packages, build manifest and lockfile formats to collect  Package URLs and extract metadata: Alpine packages, BUCK files, ABOUT files,  Android apps, Autotools, Bazel, JavaScript Bower, Java Axis, MS Cab,  Rust Cargo, Cocoapods, Chef Chrome apps, PHP Composer and composer.lock,  Conda, CPAN, Debian, Apple dmg, Java EAR, WAR, JAR, FreeBSD packages,  Rubygems gemspec, Gemfile and Gemfile.lock, Go modules, Haxe packages,  InstallShield installers, iOS apps, ISO images, Apache IVY, JBoss Sar,  R CRAN, Apache Maven, Meteor, Mozilla extensions, MSI installers,  JavaScript npm packages, package-lock.json, yarn.lock, NSIS Installers,  NugGet, OPam, Cocoapods, Python PyPI setup.py, setup.cfg, and   several related lockfile formats, semi structured README  files such as README.android, README.chromium, README.facebook, README.google,  README.thirdparty, RPMs, Shell Archives, Squashfs images, Java WAR, Windows  executables and the Windows registry  and a few more. See `all available package parsers &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/available_package_parsers.html&gt;`_  for the exhaustive list.See our `roadmap &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/roadmap.html&gt;`_for upcoming features.Documentation=============The ScanCode documentation is hosted at`scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_.If you are new to visualization of scancode results data, start with our`newcomer &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/newcomer.html&gt;`_ page.If you want to compare output changes between different versions of ScanCode, or want to look at  scans generated by ScanCode, review our`reference scans &lt;https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit-reference-scans&gt;`_.Other Important Documentation Pages:- A `synopsis &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/synopsis.html&gt;`_   of ScanCode command line options.- Tutorials on:  - `How to run a scan &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_run_a_scan.html&gt;`_  - `How to visualize scan results &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_visualize_scan_results.html&gt;`_- An exhaustive list of `all available options &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/list-options.html&gt;`_- Documentation on `Contributing to Code Development &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute/contrib_dev.html&gt;`_- Documentation on `Plugin Architecture &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/plugin_arch.html&gt;`_- `FAQ &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/misc/faq.html&gt;`_See also https://aboutcode.org for related companion projects and tools.Installation============Before installing ScanCode make sure that you have installed the prerequisitesproperly. This means installing Python 3.8 for x86/64 architectures.We support Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11.See `prerequisites &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#prerequisites&gt;`_for detailed information on the support platforms and Python versions.There are a few common ways to `install ScanCode &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html&gt;`_.- `**Installation as an application: Install Python 3.8, download a release archive, extract and run**.   &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#installation-as-an-application-downloading-releases&gt;`_  This is the recommended installation method.- `Development installation from source code using a git clone  &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#installation-from-source-code-git-clone&gt;`_- `Development installation as a library with &quot;pip install scancode-toolkit&quot;  &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#pip-install&gt;`_  [Note that this is not supported on arm64 machines]- `Run in a Docker container with a git clone and &quot;docker run&quot;  &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html#installation-via-docker&gt;`_Quick Start===========After ScanCode is installed successfully you can run an example scan printed on screen as JSON::    scancode -clip --json-pp - samplesFollow the `How to Run a Scan &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_run_a_scan.html&gt;`_tutorial to perform a basic scan on the ``samples`` directory distributed bydefault with ScanCode.See more command examples::    scancode --examplesSee `How to select what will be detected in a scan&lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_set_what_will_be_detected_in_a_scan.html&gt;`_and `How to specify the output format &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_format_scan_output.html&gt;`_for more information.You can also refer to the `command line options synopsis&lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/synopsis.html&gt;`_and an exhaustive list of `all available command line options&lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/list-options.html&gt;`_.Archive extraction==================By default ScanCode does not extract files from tarballs, zip files, andother archives as part of the scan. The archives that exist in a codebasemust be extracted before running a scan: `extractcode` is a bundled utilitybehaving as a mostly-universal archive extractor. For example, this command willrecursively extract the mytar.tar.bz2 tarball in the mytar.tar.bz2-extractdirectory::    ./extractcode mytar.tar.bz2See `all extractcode options &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference/list-options.html#all-extractcode-options&gt;`_and `how to extract archives &lt;https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/how_to_extract_archives.html&gt;`_ for details.Support=======If you have a problem, a suggestion or found a bug, please enter a ticket at:https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issuesFor discussions and chats, we have:* an official Gitter channel for `web-based chats  &lt;https://matrix.to/#/#aboutcode-org_discuss:gitter.im&gt;`_.
