	<longdescription># ocrmypdfguiI use James R. Barlow's OCRmyPDF heavily in my paperless Office and have created this Python Project as a GUI wrapper to run batch jobs on my filesystem. This is strictly a Hobby Project and is not &quot;official&quot;. Feel free to use it if you like.Icons made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com# InstallationYou can find the most up-to-date version of ocrmypdfgui on pypi which is based on GTK3.&lt;code&gt;pip install ocrmypdfgui&lt;/code&gt;There is also an (older) tkinter based version snap package on snapcraft.io:  [![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/ocrmypdfgui)or you can get if from the commandline:&lt;code&gt;sudo snap install ocrmypdfgui&lt;/code&gt;</longdescription>
