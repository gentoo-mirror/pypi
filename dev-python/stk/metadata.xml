The documentation of ``stk`` is available onhttps://stk.readthedocs.io and the project's Discord server can bejoined through https://discord.gg/zbCUzuxe2B.Installation============To get ``stk``, you can install it with pip::    $ pip install stkIf you would like to get updated when a new release of ``stk`` comesout, which happens pretty regularly, click on the ``watch`` button onthe top right corner of the GitHub page. Then select ``Releases only``from the dropdown menu.You can see the latest releases here:    https://github.com/lukasturcani/stk/releasesThere will be a corresponding release on ``pip`` for each releaseon GitHub, and you can update your ``stk`` with::    $ pip install stk --upgradeHow To Cite===========If you use ``stk`` please cite    https://github.com/lukasturcani/stkand    https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0049708Publications============about stk---------* `stk: An Extendable Python Framework for Automated Molecular and  Supramolecular Structure Assembly and Discovery`____ https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0049708* Describing metal-organic cage usage: `Unlocking the computational design of metalâ€“organic cages`____ https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/CC/D2CC00532H* (Out of date) `stk: A Python Toolkit for Supramolecular Assembly`__  | chemrxiv____ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25377__ https://chemrxiv.org/articles/STK_A_Python_Toolkit_for_Supramolecular_Assembly/6127826using stk---------* `The effect of disorder in multi-component covalent organic frameworks`____ https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/cc/d3cc01111a* `Tetramine Aspect Ratio and Flexibility Determine Framework Symmetry for Zn8L6 Self-Assembled Structures`____ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202217987* `Orientational self-sorting in cuboctahedral Pd cages`____ https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2022/sc/d2sc03856k* `Conformer-RL: A deep reinforcement learning library for conformer  generation`____ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcc.26984* `High-throughput Computational Evaluation of Low Symmetry Pd2L4  Cages to Aid in System Design`____ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202106721* `Forecasting System of Computational Time of DFT/TDDFT Calculations  under the Multiverse Ansatz via Machine Learning and  Cheminformatics`____ https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsomega.0c04981* `Using High-throughput Virtual Screening to Explore the  Optoelectronic Property Space of Organic Dyes; Finding  Diketopyrrolopyrrole Dyes for Dye-sensitized Water Splitting and  Solar Cells`____ https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/SE/D0SE00985G#!divAbstract* `Accelerated Discovery of Organic Polymer Photocatalysts for Hydrogen  Evolution from Water through the Integration of Experiment and  Theory`____ https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.9b03591* `Structurally Diverse Covalent Triazine-Based Framework Materials for  Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution from Water`____ https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b02825* `Mapping Binary Copolymer Property Space with Neural Networks`____ https://pubs.rsc.org/ko/content/articlehtml/2019/sc/c8sc05710a* `An Evolutionary Algorithm for the Discovery of Porous Organic  Cages`__ | chemrxiv____ https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/sc/c8sc03560a#!divAbstract__ https://chemrxiv.org/articles/An_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_the_Discovery_of_Porous_Organic_Cages/6954557* `Machine Learning for Organic Cage Property Prediction`__  | chemrxiv____ https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03572__ https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Machine_Learning_for_Organic_Cage_Property_Prediction/6995018* `A High-Throughput Screening Approach for the Optoelectronic  Properties of Conjugated Polymers`__ | chemrxiv____ https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00256__ https://chemrxiv.org/articles/A_High-Throughput_Screening_Approach_for_the_Optoelectronic_Properties_of_Conjugated_Polymers/6181841* `Computationally-Inspired Discovery of an Unsymmetrical Porous  Organic Cage`__ | chemrxiv____ https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/nr/c8nr06868b#!divAbstract__ https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Computationally-Inspired_Discovery_of_an_Unsymmetrical_Porous_Organic_Cage/6863684* `Maximising the Hydrogen Evolution Activity in Organic Photocatalysts  by co-Polymerisation`____ https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/TA/2018/C8TA04186E#!divAbstractAcknowledgements================I began developing this code when I was working in the Jelfs group,http://www.jelfs-group.org/, whose members often provide me withvery valuable feedback, which I gratefully acknowledge.</longdescription>
