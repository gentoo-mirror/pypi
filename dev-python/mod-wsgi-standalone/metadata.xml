	<longdescription>Overview--------The mod_wsgi package provides an Apache module that implements a WSGIcompliant interface for hosting Python based web applications on top of theApache web server.The primary package for mod_wsgi is available on the Python package index(PyPi) as ``mod_wsgi``. That package assumes that you have a suitableversion of Apache pre-installed on your target system, and if you don't,installation of the package will fail.If you are on a UNIX like system (Linux) and need a version of Apacheto be installed for you, you can use the ``mod_wsgi-standalone``package on PyPi instead. When installing the ``mod_wsgi-standalone``package it will first trigger the installation of the ``mod_wsgi-httpd``package, which will result in a version of Apache being installed aspart of your Python installation. Next the ``mod_wsgi`` package will beinstalled, with it using the version of Apache installed by the``mod_wsgi-httpd`` package rather than any system package for Apache.This method of installation is only suitable for where you want to use``mod_wsgi-express``. It cannot be used to build mod_wsgi for use withyour system Apache installation. This installation method will notwork on Windows, and also currently fails on macOS because the ApacheRuntime (APR) library, has not been updated to latest macOS versions.When installing mod_wsgi using this method, except that you will installthe ``mod_wsgi-standalone`` package instead of the ``mod_wsgi`` package,you should follow installation and usage instructions outlined on thePyPi page for the ``mod_wsgi`` package.**NOTE: Although this package may allow you to install a standalone Apacheversion, it is only really recommended that you use this package if youhave absolutely no other choice for getting the Apache httpd serverinstalled. Always use the Apache httpd server supplied with the operatingsystem if you can. Building this package if you do choose to do so, willtake some time. So if you you think the install is hanging, it is probablystill busy compiling everything.**</longdescription>
