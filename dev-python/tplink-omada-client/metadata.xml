	<longdescription># What's this?A basic Python client for calling the TP-Link Omada controller API.## Installation```consolepip install tplink-omada-client```## Supported featuresOnly a subset of the controller's features are supported:* Automatic Login/Re-login* Basic controller information* List sites* Within site:    * List Devices (APs, Gateways and Switches)    * Basic device information    * Get firmware information and initiating automatic updates    * Port status and configuraton for Switches    * Lan port configuration for Access PointsTested with OC200 on Omada Controller Version 5.5.7 - 5.7.6. Other versions may not be fully compatible.## CLIThis package provides a simple CLI for interacting with one or more Omada Controllers. To start using theCLI, you must first target a Controller.```sh$ omada -t NAME target --url https://your.omada.controller.here --user admin --password password --site MySite --set-default```Where `NAME` is a name of your choosing to identify the targeted controller. `--site` defaults to the Omadadefault site name, 'Default'.  If you do not provide a password as an argument, you will be prompted for apassword.Once you have successfully targeted a controller you can test that things are working by running:```sh$ omada devices```This will list all the devices being managed by your controller.To see a list of all the available commands, run:```sh$ omada -h```You can set up multiple targets (controllers and sites), and specify the target with the `-t &lt;NAME&gt;` parameter.If you don't specify a target, the default will be used, if that has been set.The CLI is still young so if there is any functionality you need, please create an issue and let us know.## FutureThe available API surface is quite large. More of this could be exposed in the future.There is an undocumented Websocket API which could potentially be used to get a stream of updates. However,I'm not sure how fully featured this subscription channel is on the controller. It seems to be rarely used,so probably doesn't include client connect/disconnect notifications.## ContributingThere is a VS Code development container, which sets up all of the requirements for running the package.## LicenseMIT Open Source license.</longdescription>
