	<longdescription>This package provides a thrift_transport for hive connectionsusing PyHive. This is mainly beneficial as an implementation of Pure-SASLfor Windows users where SASL is difficult to install. The other use case facilitated is support for SSL Sockets, however it is left for the user to configure the socket.</longdescription>
