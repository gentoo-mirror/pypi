It combines the core ideas of `Processing&lt;https://processing.org/&gt;`_ — learning to code in a visual context —with Python's readability to make programming more accessible tobeginners, educators, and artists.To report a bug / make a feature request use the `issues page &lt;https://github.com/p5py/p5/issues&gt;`_ in this repository. You can also use the `discourse platform&lt;https://discourse.processing.org/c/p5py/27&gt;`_  to ask/discuss anything related to p5py. Example-------.. image:: https://github.com/p5py/p5/raw/develop/docs/_static/readme.gifp5 programs are called &quot;sketches&quot; and are run as any other Pythonprogram. The sketch above, for instance, draws a circle at the mouselocation that gets a random reddish color when the mouse is pressedand is white otherwise; the size of the circle is chosen randomly. ThePython code for the sketch looks like:.. code:: python   from p5 import *   def setup():       size(640, 360)       no_stroke()       background(204)   def draw():       if mouse_is_pressed:           fill(random_uniform(255), random_uniform(127), random_uniform(51), 127)       else:           fill(255, 15)       circle_size = random_uniform(low=10, high=80)       circle((mouse_x, mouse_y), circle_size)   def key_pressed(event):       background(204)          # p5 supports different backend to render sketches, viz &quot;vispy&quot; for both 2D and 3D sketches and &quot;skia&quot; for 2D sketches   # Default renderer is set to &quot;vispy&quot;   run(renderer=&quot;vispy&quot;)Documentation-------------The p5py documentation can be found here `p5 documentation&lt;http://p5.readthedocs.io&gt;`_Installation------------Take a look at the installation steps here in the `p5 installation page&lt;http://p5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html&gt;`_Contributing------------We welcome contributions from anyone, even if you are new to open source.
