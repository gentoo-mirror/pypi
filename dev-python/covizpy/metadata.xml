We aim to make `covizpy` simple and easy to use. Our goal is to enable anyone with basic Python programming knowledge to access and visualize Covid-19 data, and make their own informed decisions and conclusions.There are existing Python packages that allow users to download and generate Covid-19 charts. For example, [covid19pandas](https://github.com/PayneLab/covid19pandas) is a package that presents COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University and The New York Times in pandas dataframes, to make analysis and visualization easier in a Python environment.While other packages have more advanced plotting capabilities, we provide simpler functions that allow users to answer questions regarding the Covid-19 pandemic as quickly as possible.## FeaturesThis package contains four functions: `plot_metric`, `plot_spec`, `get_data` and `plot_summary`.* `plot_metric`: Create a line chart presenting COVID total new cases versus another metric within a time period* `plot_spec`: Create a line chart presenting specific country/countries COVID information within a time period* `get_data`: User can retrieve the COVID data from the source as a pandas dataframe. Specific data can be retrieved by passing the date range and the list of countries* `plot_summary`: Create a horizontal bar chart summarising a specified variable and value within a time period## DependenciesBefore installing the package, following packages must be installed:- python = &quot;^3.9&quot;- pandas = &quot;^1.3.5&quot;- altair = &quot;^4.2.0&quot;- altair-saver = &quot;^0.5.0&quot;## Installation```bashpip install covizpy```## Usage and Examples To use the package, import the package with following commands:```pythonfrom covizpy.get_data import get_datafrom covizpy.plot_summary import plot_summaryfrom covizpy.plot_metric import plot_metricfrom covizpy.plot_spec import plot_spec```To use the functions, see below examples:### Retrieve COVID-19 data with specified date range and default all locations```pythondf = get_data(date_from=&quot;2022-01-01&quot;, date_to=&quot;2022-01-21&quot;)```### Plot summary graph (bar chart)```pythonplot_summary(df, var=&quot;location&quot;, val=&quot;new_cases&quot;, fun=&quot;sum&quot;, date_from=&quot;2022-01-01&quot;, date_to=&quot;2022-01-15&quot;, top_n=10)```![Summary graph](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/covizpy/raw/main/img/plot_summary.png)### Plot COVID-19 cases for specific countries (line chart)```pythonplot_spec(df, location=[&quot;Canada&quot;, &quot;Turkey&quot;], val=&quot;new_cases&quot;, date_from=&quot;2022-01-01&quot;, date_to=&quot;2022-01-07&quot;)```![New COVID-19 specific graph](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/covizpy/raw/main/img/plot_spec.png)### Plot new COVID-19 cases versus another metric (line chart)```pythonplot_metric(location=&quot;Canada&quot;, metric=&quot;positive_rate&quot;, date_from=&quot;2022-01-01&quot;, date_to=&quot;2022-01-15&quot;)```![New COVID-19 case metric graph](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/covizpy/raw/main/img/plot_metric.png)## Contributors* Rohit Rawat* Rong Li* Thomas Siu* Ting Zhe Yan## ContributingInterested in contributing?
