	<longdescription># `psquared_client` project #The `psquared_client` project contains both the `psquared_client` package thatprovides a python interface to a PSqaured server, and the `pp-cli` command lineinterface that uses that package to all copmmand line access to the server.## `pp-cli` executable ##More details about the `pp-cli` executable can be found using its help option    pp-cli -hbut here are some examples of retrieving information.(_Note:_ unless  you are using the default local PSquared server you will need to the the environmentalvariable `PP_APPLICATION` to point the server you want to use.)*   To list the currently active configurations        pp-cli*   To list the known versions of a given configuration        pp-cli -i &lt;configuration&gt;*   To display the current state of one or more items for a configuration/version.        pp-cli -i -V &lt;version&gt; &lt;configuration&gt; item ...*   To display the history of one or more items for a configuration/version.        pp-cli -H -V &lt;version&gt; &lt;configuration&gt; item ...*   As an alternate, the list of items to be acted upon can be supplied in a file with one item per line.    Thus the following displays the current state of a set of items listed in a file for a configuration/version.        pp-cli -i -f &lt;file&gt; -V &lt;version&gt; &lt;configuration&gt;Here are some examples of commands that affect the state of PSquared.(_Note:_ you may need an authorized certificate to execute these types of commands.)*   To submit one or more items for processing with a configuration/version.        pp-cli -i -s -V &lt;version&gt; &lt;configuration&gt; item ...*   To resolve the failure of one or more items for a configuration/version.        pp-cli -i --resolve -V &lt;version&gt; &lt;configuration&gt; item ...    The other transitions, `submit`, `cancel`, `reset`, 'abandon` and `recover` have similar options.## `psquared_client` package ##The `psquared_client` package provides the `PSquared` class that can be used toaccess a PSqaured server and a `Display` module that can display the responsesof a PSquared server in a readable format.### `PSquared` class ###The `PSquared` class provides various documents in reponse to a request to thePSquared server. The documents are in the form of a standard python`ElementTree`. Currently the following methods are supported.*   `get_application` - returns the application document at the URL*   `get_configuration` - returns the configuration document the named configuration*   `get_report` - returns the requested report document*   `execute_submissions` - submits a list of items for processing*   `execute_transitions` - execute a transition for a list of items### `Display` module ###The `Display` modules provides various methods for displaying the reponses thatresult from a request to the PSquared server. Currently the following methodsare supported.*   `configurations` - displays all the configurations contained in an application document*   `versions` - displays all the versions of a named configuration*   `entry` - displays the state of a given item*   `info` - displays the states of a set of items contained in a report*   `histories` - displays the history of one or more items contained in history document</longdescription>
