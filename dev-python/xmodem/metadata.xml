Now all    three data blocks are sent by single ``putc()`` call.  This resolves issues    when integrating with microcontrollers or equipment sensitive to timing    issues at stream boundaries, `PR #19    &lt;https://github.com/tehmaze/xmodem/pull/19&gt;`_.0.4.2:  * bugfix: documentation files missing from the release tarball    `Issue #16 &lt;https://github.com/tehmaze/xmodem/issues/16&gt;`_.0.4.1  * bugfix: re-transmit in ``send()`` on ``NAK`` or timeout, previously    re-transmissions (wrongly) occurred only on garbage bytes.    `PR #12 &lt;https://github.com/tehmaze/xmodem/pull/12&gt;`_.0.4.0  * enhancement: support for python 3    `PR #8 &lt;https://github.com/tehmaze/xmodem/pull/8&gt;`_.  * bugfix: CRC failures in XMODEM.recv() were not renegotiated correctly    `PR #11 &lt;https://github.com/tehmaze/xmodem/issues/11&gt;`_.</longdescription>
