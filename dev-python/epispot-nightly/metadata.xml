	<longdescription>![epispot](https://i.ibb.co/m9yS1yh/epispot-nightly.jpg)---# epispot nightlyA Python package for the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases via compartmental models. Originally designed for epidemiologists, epispot canbe adapted for almost any type of modeling scenario.&gt; This is a nightly version of epispot and may contain possibly unstable code.\&gt; **Please see usage instructions prior to adding this project as a dependency**\&gt; If you prefer to use the stable version of epispot, please see&gt; the [project on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/epispot)## InstallationThe epispot package can be installed from PyPI, Anaconda, or be built from thesource. However, as epispot's nightly versions cannot be released per-commit to the conda packaging registry, using Anaconda means that epispot will have to beinstalled via the built-in `pip` installer. Instructions for each platform are listedbelow.### PyPIThis is the easiest way to install epispot nightly. Fire up a terminal and type:```shellpip install epispot-nightly```Pip will ask you to install `numpy` and `matplotlib` as dependencies if you haven't already. Additionally, it may require you to install `fire` for the CLI.These can be installed beforehand with:```shellpip install numpypip install matplotlibpip install fire```Update the package regularly with:```shellpip install epispot-nightly --upgrade```### AnacondaPlease note that the `nightly` version is **not** available on the `conda` package registry. However, it is still possible to install on `conda`-basedsystems with```shellpip install epispot-nightly```which uses `pip` from Anaconda to install it. All dependencies are availableon the conda package registry, but you may prefer to install them via `pip` toavoid cross-referencing packages installed on different registries.Update the package regularly with:```shellpip install epispot-nightly --upgrade```If you installed the dependencies on conda instead of `pip` you may have to updatethem too after major releases. You can do that with:```shellconda update numpyconda update matplotlibconda update fire```### Building from the sourceThis is the hardest way to install `epispot-nightly` but it can be particularlyuseful if you plan on helping out with the development process. The main downsideof this approach is that you will have to continuously run `git pull` and then rerun the steps listed below to get the latest version.Clone the repository with:```shellgit clone https://github.com/epispot/epispot  # clone epispot/epispotcd epispot  # open projectpip install -r requirements.txt  # install package requirementspip install -r bin/requirements.txt  # Install CLI requirements```Then, build the nightly version with:```shellpython setup-nightly.py install```If you're working on a patch, you may find it helpful to use```shellpython setup-nightly.py develop```instead because it will greatly simplify the constant reinstallation of the package.## UsageIt is important to note that this package was designed specificallyfor getting releases out as soon as possible when modeling is important.During the COVID-19 pandemic, this strategy has allowed epispot to distribute versions quickly on PyPI, however, this package may be idle for longperiods of time when there is no need for this kind of rapid distribution.Please also note that security updates are not provided on previous nightly versions. To make sure that your version has no vulnerabilities, upgrade to the latest publishedversion regularly. The latest version of the nightly package is the one that ismaintained by our development team.## Getting StartedMake sure you are already familiar with [epispot](https://www.pypi.org/project/epispot).If not, you can find epispot's auto-generated documentation[here](https://epispot.github.io/epispot/). Additionally, we highly recommend readingthe [epispot manual](https://epispot.gitbook.io) to get a better understanding ofthe documentation and how to use epispot.## Statuses| Pipeline | Status || --- | --- || Travis CI | [![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.com/epispot/epispot.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.com/epispot/epispot) || CodeCov | [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/epispot/epispot/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=WGIM127RFY)](https://codecov.io/gh/epispot/epispot) || PyPI main | ![latest-release](https://shields.mitmproxy.org/pypi/v/epispot.svg?color=success) || PyPI nightly | ![latest-release](https://shields.mitmproxy.org/pypi/v/epispot-nightly.svg?color=success) || Security | ![GitHub issue custom search in repo](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search/epispot/epispot?color=success&amp;label=known%20vulnerabilities&amp;query=VULNERABILITY%20is:open%20is:issue) |## ContributingContributions are always welcome!See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/epispot/epispot/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to get started,including environment setup and instructions to build from the source.Please note also that epispot has many guides dedicated to certain types ofcontributions.
