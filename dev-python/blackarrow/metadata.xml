Nothing fancy, just an easy extensible wayto find things....Yeah, I know, it's &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; but ehhh, this is easier to extend tocover any and all weird cases without having to memorize a bunch of obscurecombinations of bash commands.That out of the way, let's talk about what this *actually does*...## Quick OverviewEssentially Black Arrow (or `ba` for short) is a way to search through every line in every file andfind matching keyword *or* regular expressions. It uses smart case, so if the search term is alllowercase it defaults to case-insensitive (mostly for ease of use).![png](./img/demo.png)You can also supply it with regular expressions and it handles them natively.![png](./img/demo2.png)Other features include -* excluding certain files or paths,* replacing any matches that have been found,* specifying the max depth to search (good for large directory structures),* &quot;pipe&quot; mode for unix piping,* open the files in the `$EDITOR` for manual parsing. ## Installation```┬─[zoe@fillory:~/Dropbox/Projects/black-arrow]─[09:22:12 PM]╰─&gt;$ pip install --user blackarrow```## Black-Arrow Script```bash┬─[zoe@fillory:~/Dropbox/Projects/black-arrow]─[09:33:40 PM]╰─&gt;$ ./black-arrow/blackarrow.py -husage: ba [-h] [-d DIRECTORIES [DIRECTORIES ...]] [-i IGNORE [IGNORE ...]]          [-f FILENAME [FILENAME ...]] [-w WORKERS] [-p] [-e] [-l]          [-r REPLACE] [-D DEPTH] [--dev]          Rpositional arguments:  R                     Search term (regular expression)optional arguments:  -h, --help            show this help message and exit  -d DIRECTORIES [DIRECTORIES ...], --directories DIRECTORIES [DIRECTORIES ...]                        Director(y|ies) to run against  -i IGNORE [IGNORE ...], --ignore IGNORE [IGNORE ...]                        Things to ignore (regular expressions)  -f FILENAME [FILENAME ...], --filename FILENAME [FILENAME ...]                        Filename search term(s)  -w WORKERS, --workers WORKERS                        Number of workers to use (default numcores, with                        fallback 6 unless set)  -p, --pipe            Run in &quot;pipe&quot; mode with brief output  -e, --edit            Edit the files?  -l, --lower           Check strict lower case?  -r REPLACE, --replace REPLACE                        Replace text found in place with supplied  -D DEPTH, --depth DEPTH                        Directory depth to search in  --dev                 Run in development mode (NO OUTPUT)```#### The Name*&quot;Arrow!
