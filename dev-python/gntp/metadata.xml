	<longdescription>GNTP====This is a Python library for working with the `Growl NotificationTransport Protocol &lt;http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/help/gntp.aspx&gt;`_It should work as a dropin replacement for the older Python bindingsInstallation------------You can install with pip::    $ pip install gntpthen test the module::    $ python -m gntp.notifierSimple Usage------------::    # GNTP uses the standard Python logging    import logging    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)    import gntp.notifier    # Simple &quot;fire and forget&quot; notification    gntp.notifier.mini(&quot;Here's a quick message&quot;)    # More complete example    growl = gntp.notifier.GrowlNotifier(        applicationName = &quot;My Application Name&quot;,        notifications = [&quot;New Updates&quot;,&quot;New Messages&quot;],        defaultNotifications = [&quot;New Messages&quot;],        # hostname = &quot;computer.example.com&quot;, # Defaults to localhost        # password = &quot;abc123&quot; # Defaults to a blank password    )    growl.register()    # Send one message    growl.notify(        noteType = &quot;New Messages&quot;,        title = &quot;You have a new message&quot;,        description = &quot;A longer message description&quot;,        icon = &quot;http://example.com/icon.png&quot;,        sticky = False,        priority = 1,    )    # Try to send a different type of message    # This one may fail since it is not in our list    # of defaultNotifications    growl.notify(        noteType = &quot;New Updates&quot;,        title = &quot;There is a new update to download&quot;,        description = &quot;A longer message description&quot;,        icon = &quot;http://example.com/icon.png&quot;,        sticky = False,        priority = -1,    )URL based images do not work in the OSX version of`growl &lt;http://code.google.com/p/growl/issues/detail?id=423&gt;`_ 1.4You can send the image along with the notification to get around this.::    image = open('/path/to/image.png', 'rb').read()    growl.notify(        noteType = &quot;New Messages&quot;,        title = &quot;You have a new message&quot;,        description = &quot;This time we embed the image&quot;,        icon = image,    ).. note:: With Growl 2 and above user can choose to pass notification to system   wide notifications center. In this case ``icon`` argument would be ignored   by the notification center (there would always be Growl icon instead).Bugs----`GitHub issue tracker &lt;https://github.com/kfdm/gntp/issues&gt;`_Changelog---------`v1.0.3 &lt;https://github.com/kfdm/gntp/compare/v1.0.2...v1.0.3&gt;`_    - Allow file:// scheme to be used for icons`v1.0.2 &lt;https://github.com/kfdm/gntp/compare/v1.0.1...v1.0.2&gt;`_    - Fix bug with incoming password hash    - Added info about license in each source file`v1.0.1 &lt;https://github.com/kfdm/gntp/compare/v1.0...v1.0.1&gt;`_    - Fix bug with binary data (images) being encoded incorrectly`v1.0 &lt;https://github.com/kfdm/gntp/compare/v0.9...v1.0&gt;`_    - Python 3.3 Support`v0.9 &lt;https://github.com/kfdm/gntp/compare/v0.8...v0.9&gt;`_    - Remove duplicate code from gntp.config    - Catch all errors and rethrow them as gntp.errors to make it easier for      other programs to deal with errors from the gntp library.    - Ensure that we open resource files as &quot;rb&quot; and update the documentation`v0.8 &lt;https://github.com/kfdm/gntp/compare/v0.7...v0.8&gt;`_    - Fix a bug where resource sections were missing a CRLF    - Fix a bug where the cli client was using config values over options    - Add support for coalescing`v0.7 &lt;https://github.com/kfdm/gntp/compare/0.6...v0.7&gt;`_    - Support for images    - Better test coverage support`0.6 &lt;https://github.com/kfdm/gntp/compare/0.5...0.6&gt;`_    - ConfigParser aware GrowlNotifier that reads settings from ~/.gntp</longdescription>
