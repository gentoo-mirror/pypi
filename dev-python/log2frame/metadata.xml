	<longdescription># `log2frame``import log2frame`A function to read well log data in LAS, LIS and DLIS formats and extract curves data as DataFrame.The curves and header data are stored in an instance of `Log` class, designed to hold this data and operate with it.If multiple log files are read together, the __Log__ instances are packed in a `Pack` instance, designed to hold `Log` instances and operate with them.# to read log filesSimply call the function `read()` with the path or path pattern as argument:## a single log fileTo load a single _.las_, _.lis_ or _.dlis_ file. The function will return a `Log` instance containing the data:  - `log2frame.read( path_to_file )` ## several files in a folder  To load several files at once. In this case the `read()` function will return a `Pack` instance containing a `Log` instance for each log file:  - `log2frame.read( path_to_folder_containing_files/*.* )` By default, any invalid file will be ignored, thus, there is no problem to have other files in the same folder as the log files.## several files recursivelyTo read files recursively in subdirectories, use the appropriate `fnmatch` pattern:  - `log2frame.read( path_to_folder_containing_files/**/*.* )`# further examples and detailsPlease refer to the Jupyter notebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ayaranitram/log2frame/blob/master/log2frame_demo.ipynb&quot;&gt;**log2frame_demo**&lt;/a&gt; for further examples and details on how to use **`log2frame`**.  The sample data is publicly available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nlog.nl/en&quot;&gt;**NLOG**&lt;/a&gt;.</longdescription>
