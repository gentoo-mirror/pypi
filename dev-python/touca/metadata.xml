Come say hi! We love making newfriends. If you need help, have any questions, or like to contribute or providefeedback, that's the best place to be.## ContributingWe welcome all forms of contributions, from adding new features to improvingdocumentation and sharing feedback.- [Code of Conduct](https://touca.io/docs/contributing/conduct/)- [Contributing Guide](https://touca.io/docs/contributing/)- [Good First Issues](https://touca.io/docs/contributing/good-first-issues/)## FAQ- Should I install Touca as a development dependency?  Yes, unless you like to capture data-points that are not accessible through  your software's public API. Touca data capturing functions (e.g. `touca.check`  and `touca.scoped_timer`) are no-op in production environments. They only work  when called from a `@touca.workflow` context.- How is Touca making money?  Touca is open-source software that you can self-host for free. Touca, Inc.  operates [Touca Cloud](https://app.touca.io): a managed cloud instance of  Touca with additional enterprise-ready features. We have a free plan and  leverage usage-based pricing to charge for storage and service.
