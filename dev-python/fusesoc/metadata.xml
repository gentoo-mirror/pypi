It is written in Python and can beinstalled like any other Python package through &quot;pip&quot;. Please refer to thefull list of system requirements and installation instructions in the[Installation section in the User Guide](https://fusesoc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/installation.html).### Quick startTo check if FuseSoC is working, and to get an initial feeling for how FuseSoCworks, you can try to simulate a simple hardware design from our core libray.First, create and enter an empty workspace    mkdir workspace    cd workspaceInstall the FuseSoc base library into the workspace    fusesoc library add fusesoc-cores https://github.com/fusesoc/fusesoc-coresGet a list of cores found in the workspace    fusesoc core listIf you have any of the supported simulators installed, you can try torun a simulation on one of the cores as well. For example,`fusesoc run --target=sim i2c` will run a regression test on the corei2c with Icarus Verilog. If you want to try another simulator instead,add e.g. `--tool=modelsim` or `--tool=xcelium` between `run` and `i2c`.`fusesoc --help` will give you more information on commands and switches.Did it work? Great! FuseSoC can be used to create FPGA images, performlinting, manage your IP libraries or do formal verification as well.Check out the [online documentation](https://fusesoc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)documentation to learn more about creating your own core files and usingexisting ones. If it didn't work, please get in touch (see below).## Next stepsA good way to get your first hands-on experience with FuseSoC is tocontribute to the [LED to Believe](https://github.com/fusesoc/blinky)project. This project aims to used FuseSoC to blink a LED on everyavailable FPGA development board in existence. There are already around40 different boards supported. If your board is already supported,great, then you can run your first FuseSoC-based design. If it's notsupported, great, you now have the chance to add it to the list ofsupported boards. Either way, head over to [LED toBelieve](https://github.com/fusesoc/blinky) to learn more and see how togo from a blinking LED to running a RISC-V core on an FPGA.## Need help?FuseSoC comes with extensive[online documentation](https://fusesoc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).For quick communication with the active developers, feel free to join us at the[FuseSoC chat](https://gitter.im/librecores/fusesoc).If you have found an issue, or want to know more about currently known problems,check out the[issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc/issues).If you are looking for professional paid support, we are happy toprovide feature additions, bug fixes, user training, setting up corelibraries, migrating existing designs to FuseSoC and other things.Please contact &lt;olof.kindgren@gmail.com&gt; for more information.## Contributing to FuseSoCFuseSoC is developed by an active and friendly community, and you're welcome tojoin! You can read more about setting up a development environment in our[Developer's Guide](https://fusesoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/index.html).You can file bug reports and propose changes in the [olofk/fusesoc repository on GitHub](https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc).## Further reading* A Scalable Approach to IP Management with FuseSoC [paper](https://osda.gitlab.io/19/kindgren.pdf) and [slides](https://osda.gitlab.io/19/kindgren-slides.pdf) from OSDA 2019* Antmicro blog post on [how to use FuseSoC as a linter](https://antmicro.com/blog/2020/04/systemverilog-linter-and-formatter-in-fusesoc/)* [FuseSoC-related posts on the Tales from Beyond the Register Map blog](https://blog.award-winning.me/search/label/FuseSoC)* [Presentation from RISC-V Week 2022](https://www.award-winning.me/fusesoc-rvweek22)* [Presentation from Latch-Up Portland 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eWRAOK9mns)* [Presentation from WOSH 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOFYplIBSWM)* [Presentation from ORConf 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPpT9k_H67k)* [Presentation from ORConf 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKlJWe_HKPM)## LicenseFuseSoC is licensed under the permissive 2-clause BSD license, freely allowinguse, modification, and distribution of FuseSoC for all kinds of projects.Please refer to the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.</longdescription>
