This is thepath to the `xmldoc/` directory under Pythia's `share` directory.You can do something like this in your shell config:```bashexport PYTHIA8DATA=/home/$USER/pythia82xx/share/Pythia8/xmldoc```### Without an existing Pythia installation (using conda)If this is not already the case, a very convenient solution is to install itvia `conda`. This is fast, and automatically sets the `PYTHIA8DATA` environmentvariable when you activate the virtual environment. An environment file isprovided in the root of this repo, which will install all requirements and thenshowerpipe, automatically. The virtual environment can be created using:```bashconda env create -f environment.yml```If you have an existing conda environment, you can update it by activating theenvironment and then using:```bashconda env update -f environment.yml --prune```### With existing Pythia installationSimply:```bashpip install showerpipe```</longdescription>
