	<longdescription># HitchStory[![Main branch status](https://github.com/hitchdev/hitchstory/actions/workflows/regression.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hitchdev/hitchstory/actions/workflows/regression.yml)HitchStory is a literate python testing framework where the tests can rewrite themselves and [write your docs](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/approach/triality).[![Test rewriting itself](https://hitchdev.com/images/video-thumb.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqk5Sao27O0 &quot;Test rewriting itself&quot;)The executable specifications are written, using [StrictYAML](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/why/strictyaml) andcan test and document applications of any kind.Fully fleshed out examples (a website, an interactive CLI, a REST API and Python API) with self rewriting tests and generated docs can be seen[in the examples folder](https://github.com/hitchdev/hitchstory/tree/master/examples)and run.The library is 100% pure python. The tests can be run:* [Inside pytest or similar](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/using/pytest)* [Or via a basic CLI runner](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/using/basic-cli)## Exampleexample.story:```yamlLogged in:  given:    website: /login  # preconditions  steps:  - Form filled:      username: AzureDiamond      password: hunter2  - Clicked: loginEmail sent:  about: |    The most basic email with no subject, cc or bcc    set.  based on: logged in             # inherits from and continues from test above  following steps:  - Clicked: new email  - Form filled:      to: Cthon98@aol.com      contents: |                # long form text        Hey guys,        I think I got hacked!
