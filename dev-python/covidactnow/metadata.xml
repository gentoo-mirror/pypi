	<longdescription># Covid Act Now Database WrapperThis package is an extremely bare-bones wrapper around Covid Act Now's database of COVID-19 related information. View the PyPi project [here](https://pypi.org/project/covidactnow/), and the original post page [here](https://covidinfo.preritdas.com). Usage is simple. Install the package with `pip install covidactnow`.Instantiate a user object with your API key as an argument. You can easily generate an API key [here](https://covidactnow.org/data-api).```pythonimport covidactnowapi = covidactnow.User(api_key = 'yourapikey')washingtonInfectionRate = api.infRate('WA')massachussettsVaxRate = api.vaxRate('MA')print(f&quot;{washingtonInfectionRate = }&quot;)print(f&quot;{massachussettsVaxRate = }&quot;)```This will result (with different data, of course):```washingtonInfectionRate = 1.16massachussettsVaxRate = 76.3```To view the docstring (explainer) of a particular function, use `covidactnow.User.infRate.__doc__` where `infRate` can be repalced with any other function. For example, running `print(covidactnow.User.freeBedPercentage.__doc__)` will return: `Get's the percentage of free hospital beds by state.` Depending on your IDE, hovering over a function in the editor will show the function's docstring (works in VS Code).```pythonimport covidactnowif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    print(covidactnow.User.infRate.__doc__)    print(covidactnow.User.freeBedPercentage.__doc__)&quot;&quot;&quot; Result:&gt;&gt;&gt; Gets today's COVID infection rate by state.&gt;&gt;&gt; Get's the percentage of free hospital beds by state.&quot;&quot;&quot;----For more information on how the wrapper works, particularly how it was redesigned to be package-friendly, read the &quot;Updated for Distribution&quot; section of this [page](https://covidinfo.preritdas.com). Note that this version has been updated to get data from within a `User` class allowing individual API keys to be used (as opposed to defining a state as an object and defining statistics as object attributes).</longdescription>
