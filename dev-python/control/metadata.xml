In addition, some routinesuse a module called slycot, that is a Python wrapper around some FORTRANroutines.  Many parts of python-control will work without slycot, but somefunctionality is limited or absent, and installation of slycot is recommended(see below). The Slycot wrapper can be found at:https://github.com/python-control/SlycotInstallation============Conda and conda-forge---------------------The easiest way to get started with the Control Systems library isusing `Conda &lt;https://conda.io&gt;`_.The Control Systems library has packages available using the `conda-forge&lt;https://conda-forge.org&gt;`_ Conda channel, and as of Slycot version0.3.4, binaries for that package are available for 64-bit Windows,OSX, and Linux.To install both the Control Systems library and Slycot in an existingconda environment, run::  conda install -c conda-forge control slycotMixing packages from conda-forge and the default conda channel cansometimes cause problems with dependencies, so it is usually best toinstally NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib from conda-forge as well.Pip---To install using pip::  pip install slycot   # optional; see below  pip install controlIf you install Slycot using pip you'll need a development environment(e.g., Python development files, C and Fortran compilers).  Pipinstallation can be particularly complicated for Windows.Installing from source----------------------To install from source, get the source code of the desired branch or releasefrom the github repository or archive, unpack, and run from within thetoplevel `python-control` directory::  pip install .  Article and Citation Information================================An `article &lt;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9683368&gt;`_ aboutthe library is available on IEEE Explore.
