A heroic effort, built over years, to read[more than a 100 file formats](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.6.1/supported-formats.html).  Naturally, we want some of that goodness for `napari` ... hence this plugin.**However:** it's important to note that this plugin _still_requires having a java runtime engine installed.  This is easy enough to do(the plugin will ask to install it for you if you're in a `conda` environment), butit definitely makes for a more complicated environment setup, it's not very&quot;pythonic&quot;, and the performance will likely not feel as snappy as a native &quot;pure&quot;python module.So, before you reflexively install this plugin to fill that bio-formatssized hole in your python heart, consider trying some of the other pure-pythonplugins designed to read your format of interest:- **Zeiss (.czi)**: [napari-aicsimageio](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/napari-aicsimageio), [napari-czifile2](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/napari-czifile2)- **Nikon (.nd2)**: [napari-nikon-nd2](https://github.com/cwood1967/napari-nikon-nd2), [nd2-dask](https://github.com/DragaDoncila/nd2-dask)- **Leica (.lif)**: [napari-aicsimageio](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/napari-aicsimageio)- **Olympus (.oif)**: no plugin?  (but see [oiffile](https://pypi.org/project/oiffile/) )- **DeltaVision (.dv, .mrc)**: [napari-dv](https://github.com/tlambert03/napari-dv)&gt; *if you have a pure-python reader for a bio-formats-supported file format thatyou'd like to see added to this list, please open an issue*## InstallationThe easiest way to install `napari-bioformats` is via [conda], from the[conda-forge] channel:    conda install -c conda-forge napari-bioformatsIt is also possible to install via [pip], but you will need to have a workingJVM installed, and may need to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable    pip install napari-bioformats### First UsageThe first time you attempt to open a file with napari-bioformats, you willlikely notice a long delay as pims downloads the `loci_tools.jar` (speed willdepend on your internet connection). Subsequent files should open more quickly.## LicenseDistributed under the terms of the [GPLv3] license,&quot;napari-bioformats&quot; is free and open source software## IssuesIf you encounter any problems, please [file an issue] along with a detailed description._This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using with [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template._[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari[Cookiecutter]: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter[@napari]: https://github.com/napari[GPLv3]: https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0[cookiecutter-napari-plugin]: https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin[file an issue]: https://github.com/tlambert03/napari-bioformats/issues[napari]: https://github.com/napari/napari[tox]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/[conda]: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/[conda-forge]: https://conda-forge.org[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/</longdescription>
