	<longdescription>Bridgekeeper------------..    | Who would cross the Bridge of Death    | must answer me these questions three,    | ere the other side he see.    -- The Bridgekeeper, *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*Bridgekeeper is a permissions library for Django_ projects, where permissions are defined in your code, rather than in your database.It's heavily inspired by django-rules_, but with one important difference: **it works on QuerySets as well as individual model instances**.This means that you can efficiently show a list of all of the model instances that your user is allowed to edit, for instance, without having your permission-checking code in two different places... _django: https://djangoproject.com/.. _django-rules: https://github.com/dfunckt/django-rulesBridgekeeper is tested on Django 2.2 and 3.0 on all Python versions Django supports, and is licensed under the MIT License.</longdescription>
