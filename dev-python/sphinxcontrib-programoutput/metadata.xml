	<longdescription>============================= sphinxcontrib-programoutput=============================.. image:: https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/workflows/tests/badge.svg   :target: https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/actions?query=workflow%3Atests.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/badge.svg   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutputhttps://sphinxcontrib-programoutput.readthedocs.orgA Sphinx_ extension to literally insert the output of arbitrary commands intodocuments, helping you to keep your command examples up to date.Installation============Install this extension from PyPI_::   pip install sphinxcontrib-programoutputThe extension requires Sphinx 1.7.0 and Python 2.7 or Python 3 (Python3.6+ is tested) at least.Usage=====Just add this extension to ``extensions``::   extensions = ['sphinxcontrib.programoutput']Now you've two new directives ``program-output`` and ``command-output`` toinsert the output of programs.  The former just inserts the output::   .. program-output:: python -VOutput::   Python 2.7.1The latter directive mimics a shell session, and is intended to show examples::   .. command-output:: python -VOutput::   $ python -V   Python 2.7.1Please refer to the documentation_ for comprehensive information about usage andconfiguration of this extension.Development and Support=======================Please refer to the documentation_ for information on support and thedevelopment process... _Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/.. _PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-programoutput.. _documentation: http://sphinxcontrib-programoutput.readthedocs.org========= Changes=========0.17 (2021-03-31)=================- Add support for Python 3.9.- Drop support for python 3.5.- Include program output and current working directory in the warning  logged when a program returns an unexpected return code. Suggested  by Sorin Sbarnea. See `issue 50  &lt;https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/50&gt;`_.0.16 (2020-03-23)=================- Add ``name`` and ``caption`` options. Added in  `PR 41 &lt;https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/pull/41&gt;`_  by Raphaël.- Add support for Python 3.8.0.15 (2019-09-16)=================- Make the test suite stop assuming the presence of a 'python'  executable on the path. Instead it uses ``sys.executable`` (which  shouldn't have spaces). Note that it does continue to assume the  presence of other executables, such as 'echo'. Reported in `issue 38  &lt;https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/38&gt;`_  by John Vandenberg.0.14 (2019-04-08)=================- Add ``python_requires`` metadata to better allow tools like ``pip``  to install a correct version.- Add support for Sphinx 2.0 on Python 3.- Avoid unicode errors when the program command or output produced  non-ASCII output and the configured prompt was a byte string. This  was most likely under Python 2, where the default configured prompt  is a byte string. Reported by, and patch inspired by, `issue 33  &lt;https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/33&gt;`_  by latricewilgus.0.13 (2018-12-22)=================- Drop support for Sphinx &lt; 1.7.- Fix tests on Sphinx &gt;= 1.8.0.- Restore error message into the document by default from failed  program runs on Sphinx &gt;= 1.8.0b1.- Fix deprecation warnings on Sphinx &gt;= 1.8. Reported in `issue 29  &lt;https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/29&gt;`_  by miili.0.11 (2017-05-18)=================- Explicitly set ``parallel_read_safe`` to true in the extension  metadata. See `issue 25  &lt;https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/25&gt;`_.  With thanks to Adam J. Stewart and Stephen McDowell.0.10 (2017-03-17)=================- Decode output from the program tolerantly, using the 'replace'  handler. Based on a `pull request  &lt;https://github.com/habnabit/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/commit/592078e0386c2a36d50a6528b6e49d91707138bf&gt;`_  by Stefan C. Müller.0.9 (2017-03-15)================- Forked and revived the project in `Gitub  &lt;https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput&gt;`_.- Run the tests on Travis CI. Formatting and style is enforced by pylint.- The oldest supported and tested Sphinx version is now 1.3.5. See  `issue 17  &lt;https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/17&gt;`_.- Remove support for Python 2.6, Python 3.2 and 3.3.- 100% test coverage.- Remove support for ``programoutput_use_ansi``. The  ``sphinxcontrib.ansi`` extension is no longer available on PyPI.0.8 (Oct 12, 2012)==================- Migrated to GitHub0.7 (Apr 17, 2012)==================- Added ``cwd`` option to ``..program-output``- Working directory of executed programs defaults to documentation root now0.6 (Jan 07, 2012)==================- Python 3 support- Require Sphinx 1.1 now0.5 (Sep 19, 2011)==================- ``programoutput_prompt_template`` is interpreted as format string now!- Require Python 2.6 now- Added ``returncode`` option to ``program-output`` (thanks to  Jan-Marek Glogowski)- Support ``returncode`` formatting key in  ``programoutput_prompt_template``- Warn on unexpected return codes instead of raising  ``subprocess.CalledProcessError``- Turn fatal errors during command into document error messages  instead of crashing the build0.4.1 (Mar 11, 2011)====================- Some source code cleanups- Fixed installation instructions in documentation0.4 (May 21, 2010)==================- Initial release</longdescription>
