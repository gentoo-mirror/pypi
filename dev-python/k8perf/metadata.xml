	<longdescription># Benchmark applicationThis is a benchmark application for kubernetes. It is used to test network performance of a kubernetes cluster.&lt;img alt=&quot;k8perf logo&quot; src=&quot;./assets/logo.png&quot;/&gt;## Demo of the application[![k8perf demo video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/RA5H2KPW4Ic/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA5H2KPW4Ic)## Run the applicationinstall this python package, a place where you have a kubernetes config file, and run the following command:```pip install k8perfpython -m k8perf run```You can get a json output from the command line by adding the `--json` flag.## ContributingIf you want to contribute, here is how to get your envirorment setup#### Virtualenvyou can activate the virtualenv with the following command:```bashsource bin/activate```if you're not using the script, remember to install the module with the following command:```bash    pip install --editable .```### ReleasesGithub actions most of the work for you.- At every push to main a new version is released to pypi. These are released at &quot;pre-release&quot; status.- To make a new release, create a new tag with the following format: `X.Y.Z`. This will trigger a new release to pypi.You just need to create a new release on github, and the action will take care of the rest.### Run iperf 3 benchmark on kubernetes without toolThere are two files in the folder `benchmarks/bandwidth`:- the server `iperf3-server.yaml`- the client `iperf3-client.yaml`## Results- The results of our experiments are located in the `results` folder. - Images and visualizations of data and analysis are located in the `results/images` folder.#### TODO- [ ] add a way to specify the namespace- [ ] Run http benchmark until the server is up to 90% cpu usage- [ ] loading bar for the benchmark- [ ] Stream the output of the benchmark (Use streamlit)- [ ] Move plot to &quot;[plot]&quot; depedencies, and make local imports in main, with error message helping to install plots </longdescription>
