	<longdescription># nova-lxd [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lxc/nova-lxd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lxc/nova-lxd)An OpenStack Compute driver for managing containers using LXD.## nova-lxd on DevstackFor development purposes, nova-lxd provides a devstack plugin. To use it, just include thefollowing in your devstack `local.conf`:```[[local|localrc]]enable_plugin nova-lxd https://git.openstack.org/openstack/nova-lxd# You should enable the following if you use lxd 3.0.# In addition, this setting requires zfs &gt;= 0.7.0.#LXD_BACKEND_DRIVER=zfs```Change git repositories as needed (it's probably not very useful to point to the mainnova-lxd repo). If you have a local tree you'd like to use, you can symlink your tree to`/opt/stack/nova-lxd` and do your development from there.The devstack default images won't work with lxd, as lxd doesn't support them. Once yourstack is up and you've configured authentication against your devstack, do the following::```wget http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/xenial/current/xenial-server-cloudimg-amd64-root.tar.gzglance image-create --name xenial --disk-format raw --container-format bare --file xenial-server-cloudimg-amd64-root.tar.gz```You can test your configuration using the exercise scripts in devstack. For instance,```DEFAULT_IMAGE_NAME=xenial ./exercises/volumes.sh```Please note: the exercise scripts in devstack likely won't work, as they have requirementsfor using the cirros images.# Support and discussionsWe use the LXC mailing-lists for developer and user discussions, you canfind and subscribe to those at: https://lists.linuxcontainers.orgIf you prefer live discussions, some of us also hang out in[#lxcontainers](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#lxcontainers) on irc.freenode.net.## Bug reportsBug reports can be filed at https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova-lxd</longdescription>
