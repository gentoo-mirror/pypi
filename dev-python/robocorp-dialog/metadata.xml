	<longdescription># Robocorp DialogA separate executable which opens a dialog window for querying user input.Content created dynamically based on JSON spec.Used in [Dialogs](https://github.com/robocorp/rpaframework/tree/master/packages/dialogs) library.## How to buildThe Python project uses pywebview to render the files in the `static/` folder.In order to install the Python and JS dependencies you can use:`poetry run inv install`and then to build the static files once use:`poetry run inv build-js`It is recommended that for development you use the watch command so that the front-end is continously built after each change:`poetry run inv watch-js`## How to testUse: `poetry run inv test`## How to runYou will also need a JSON formatted input that will contain the elements to be rendered in the dialog.An example of such a JSON would be: [form_with_steps.json](./tests/assets/form_with_steps.json)Then the command you use to call the `main.py` file will have to contain this JSON alongside the window title and sizes.A basic example to start a dialog with a heading would be:```cmdpython robocorp_dialog/main.py --title Dialog --width 480 --height 100 --auto_height '[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;heading&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Send feedback&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;medium&quot;}]'```</longdescription>
