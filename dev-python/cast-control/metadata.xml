	<longdescription># üì∫ Control Chromecasts from Linux`cast_control` is [a daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)) utility that allows you to control media playback on casting devices from the Linux desktop.While this service runs, it collects data about the media and apps playing on your casting devices and displays it on your computer.### Integrations`cast_control` controls Chromecasts and casting devices via D-Bus and [MPRIS media player controls](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/2.2/). MPRIS is the standard media player interface on Linux desktops. MPRIS integration is [enabled by default](https://github.com/KDE/plasma-workspace/tree/master/applets/mediacontroller) in Plasma Desktop, and, along with GNOME's volume control widget, [there are widgets for GNOME](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1379/mpris-indicator-button/), too. [`playerctl` provides a CLI](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl) for controlling media players through MPRIS.Check out [‚ñ∂Ô∏èmpris_server](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/mpris_server) if you want to integrate MPRIS support into your media player.## ScreenshotsControlling a Chromecast via Plasma Desktop's Media Player widget:&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/chromecast_mpris/raw/name_change/cast_control/assets/mpris_widget.png&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/chromecast_mpris/raw/name_change/cast_control/assets/mpris_plasma.png&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;## Features  * [x] Control music and video playback  * [x] Control app playback  * [x] View playback information in real-time  * [x] Display thumbnail and title  * [x] Display playback position and media length  * [x] Seek forward and backward  * [x] Play, pause, and stop playback  * [x] Volume up and down  * [x] Play next and previous  * [x] Quit casted app  * [x] Open media from D-Bus  * [x] Play YouTube videos  * [ ] Playlist integration## Installation### Requirements - Linux / *BSD / [macOS](https://github.com/zbentley/dbus-osx-examples) - [D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) - Python &gt;= 3.7 - [PyGObject](https://pypi.org/project/PyGObject/) - `requirements.txt` #### Installing PyGObjectOn Debian-derived distributions like Ubuntu, install `python3-gi` with `apt`. On Arch, you'll want to install `python-gobject`, or install `cast_control` [directly from the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cast_control/).On macOS, install [`pygobject3`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pygobject3) via `brew`.Use `pip` to install `PyGObject&gt;=3.34.0` if there are no installation candidates available in your vendor's package repositories.### PyPI```bash$ python3 -m pip install cast_control```You'll get a `cast_control` executable added to your `$PATH`.### GitHubCheck out [the releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/cast_control/releases) for stable releases.If you'd like to use the development branch, clone the repository.Once you have a source copy, run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, followed by `python3 setup.py install`. You'll get a `cast_control` executable added to your `$PATH`.### AURIf you're on Arch, you can install `cast_control` [directly from the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cast_control/). Thanks, [@yochananmarqos](https://github.com/yochananmarqos)!```bash$ yay -S cast_control```### UpgradesStable releases are uploaded to PyPI. You can upgrade your `cast_control` installation like so:```bash$ python3 -m pip --upgrade cast_control```See the [releases page](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/cast_control/releases) on GitHub.## UsageYou'll need to make sure that your computer can make network connections with your casting devices. It also helps to know the names of the devices in advance.### LaunchInstalling the package via PyPI, GitHub or the AUR will add `cast_control` to your `pip` executables path:```bash$ which cast_control ~/.local/bin/cast_control```If you have your `pip` executables path added to your shell's `$PATH`, you can launch `cast_control` like so:```bash$ cast_control --help```Or, using the short name launcher `castctl`:```bash$ castctl --help```You can also launch `cast_control` via its Python module. This can be useful if your `$PATH` doesn't point to your `pip` executables.```bash$ python3 -m cast_control --help```### Help#### Shell completionTo enable Bash completion for `cast_control`, add the following to your `~/.bashrc`:```basheval &quot;$(_CAST_CONTROL_COMPLETE=bash_source cast_control)&quot;```For the `zsh` and `fish` shells, check out [the documentation here](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/shell-completion/#enabling-completion).#### Help text```bash$ cast_control --helpUsage: cast_control [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

MPRIS support is built in directly to Plasma Desktop and GNOME 3, and you can use `playerctl` on the command-line. ### Retry until a Chromecast is foundYou can use the `-w/--wait` flag to specify a waiting period in seconds before `cast_control` will try to find a casting device again if one is not found initially.For example, if you want to wait 60 seconds between scans for devices, you can run the following:```bash$ export SECONDS=60$ cast_control connect --wait $SECONDS# or$ cast_control service connect --wait $SECONDS```This is useful if you'd like to start `cast_control` at login, and there is a chance that your device isn't on, or you're on a different network. ### Reconnect or disconnect the background serviceIf the background service is running, you can force it to reconnect and restart, or to disconnect it entirely.```bash$ cast_control service reconnect# or$ cast_control service disconnect```### Open a URI on a Chromecast Get the D-Bus name for your device using `playerctl`.```bash$ playerctl --list-allMy_Device```Use the D-Bus name to issue commands to it.```bash$ export URL=&quot;http://ccmixter.org/content/gmz/gmz_-_Parametaphoriquement.mp3&quot;$ playerctl --player My_Device open &quot;$URL&quot;```This will play a song on your device.### Open a YouTube videoYou can cast YouTube videos the same way you can cast a generic URI.```bash$ export VIDEO=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4nkgJdVZFA&quot;$ playerctl --player My_Device open &quot;$VIDEO&quot;```### LogsYou can set the log level using the `-l/--log-level` flag with the `connect` or `service connect` commands:```bash$ cast_control connect --log-level debug```Here's a [list of log levels supported by `cast_control`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels).You can view the background service's log file with the `service log` command:```bash$ cast_control service log```## SupportWant to support this project and [other open-source projects](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo) like it?&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/alexdelorenzo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-blue.png&quot; alt=&quot;Buy Me A Coffee&quot; height=&quot;60px&quot; style=&quot;height: 60px !important;width: 217px !important;max-width:25%&quot; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;## LicenseSee `LICENSE`.
