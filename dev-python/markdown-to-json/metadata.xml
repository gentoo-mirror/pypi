	<longdescription># Markdown to JSON converter## DescriptionA simple tool to convert Markdown (CommonMark dialect) data into JSON. It uses headings as JSON keys, and the stuff following headings as values. Lists are turned into arrays. Higher heading values yield nested JSON keys.## Why would you want to do this?If you don't mind the loss of fidelity to the exact Markdown Document Object Model (DOM), you can get a simple python or json datastructure to extract data-like structures from a Markdown document.This tool was built to allow easy creation of dataset descriptions for the [Brain Imaging Data Structure](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/) data sharing specification.## InstallationNon isolated install from pypi```bashpip install markdown-to-jsonmd_to_json --help```Isolated install with pipx if you only want the CLI```bashpipx install markdown-to-jsonmd_to_json --help```Install bleeding edge from github```bashpip install git+https://github.com/njvack/markdown-to-json/python -m markdown_to_json --help``````bashgit clone https://github.com/njvack/markdown-to-json.gitcd markdown_to_json./setup.py install```The package has no external requirements and has been tested python 3.6+.Please use version 1 or 1.1 for python 2.x.## CLI Usage, `md_to_json````Translate markdown into JSON.Usage:  md_to_json [options] &lt;markdown_file&gt;  md_to_json -h | --helpOptions:  -h --help     Show this screen  --version     Print version number  -o &lt;file&gt;     Save output to a file instead of stdout  -i &lt;val&gt;      Indent nested JSON by this amount. Use a negative number for                most compact possible JSON. the [default: 2]```## Programmatic usage```pythonimport markdown_to_jsonvalue = &quot;&quot;&quot;# Nested List* Item 1    * Item 1.1* Item 2&quot;&quot;&quot;# The simple way:dictified = markdown_to_json.dictify(value)assert dictified == {'Nested List': ['Item 1', ['Item 1.1'], 'Item 2']}# Or, if you want a json stringjsonified = markdown_to_json.jsonify(value)assert jsonified == &quot;&quot;&quot;{&quot;Nested List&quot;: [&quot;Item 1&quot;, [&quot;Item 1.1&quot;], &quot;Item 2&quot;]}&quot;&quot;&quot;```This translates a markdown document into JSON as described in the example below.## ExampleThe markdown:```markdown# DescriptionThis is an example file# Authors* Nate Vack* Vendor Packages    * docopt    * CommonMark-py# Versions## Version 1Here's something about Version 1; I said &quot;Hooray!&quot;## Version 2Here's something about Version 2```will translate to the JSON:```json{  &quot;Description&quot;: &quot;This is an example file&quot;,  &quot;Authors&quot;: [&quot;Nate Vack&quot;, &quot;Vendor Packages&quot;, [&quot;docopt&quot;, &quot;CommonMark-py&quot;]],  &quot;Versions&quot;: {    &quot;Version 1&quot;: &quot;Here's something about Version 1; I said \&quot;Hooray!\&quot;&quot;,    &quot;Version 2&quot;: &quot;Here's something about Version 2&quot;  }}```## Credits`markdown_to_json` was written by Nate Vack &lt;njvack@freshforever.net&gt; at the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.Maintenance development by [Matthew Martin](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/) This tool ships a few really excellent tools in its `vendor` directory:[docopt](https://github.com/docopt/docopt) is copyright (c) 2012 Vladimir Keleshev, &lt;vladimir@keleshev.com&gt;Upgraded to docopt-ng.[CommonMark-py](https://github.com/rolandshoemaker/CommonMark-py) is copyright Copyright (c) 2014, Bibek Kafle and Roland Shoemaker. Cannot upgrade to 0.6.0 because of breaking changes in AST.</longdescription>
