This project aims to solve this problem once forall.Don't get me wrong, this work is a huge undertaking. Postal address parsing,normalization and rendering is hard. See the collection of `falsehoodsprogrammers believe about postal addresses&lt;https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood#postal-addresses&gt;`_.This library is still in its early stages, but is good enough to implementthe new European Directives on VAT, which requires all e-commerce shops toguess the locality of their EU customers depending on their billing address.</longdescription>
