It's by default enabled. To disable it: plugins=[..., &quot;no:runinfo&quot;], or uninstall this plugin.## Plugin options- `runinfo_lang`: The name of the language to run the job script for session info.    Default is `None`, which means it will be inferred from the `proc.lang`    This should be a process-level option, unless you only have one single    process in your pipeline.- `runinfo_path`: Whether to include paths for the modules in the session information.    Default is `True`.    This option could be either specified in the process-level or the pipeline-level.    Only works for `python`.- `runinfo_submod`: Whether to include submodules in the session information.    Default is `False`.    This option could be either specified in the process-level or the pipeline-level.    Only works for `python`.## Supported languages for session info`python`, `R`, `bash`, and `fish`.## UsageThe plugin will generate 3 files in the job directory of the pipeline.### `job.runinfo.session`The session information of the job, including the interpreter, packages and their versions.#### PythonGenerates a TSV file with the following columns:- `Name`: The name of the module, or python itself- `__version__`: The version fetched by `module.__version__` or `module.version`- `importlib.metadata`: The version fetched by `importlib.metadata.version(package)`- `Path`: The path of the module (only if `runinfo_path` is `True`)#### RGenerates a text file `sessionInfo()` output.#### BashGenerates a TSV file with the following columns:- `SHELL`: The value of `$SHELL`- `BASH_VERSION`: The value of `$BASH_VERSION`- `BASH_ARGV0`: The value of `$BASH_ARGV0`- `BASH_SOURCE`: The value of `$BASH_SOURCE`- `proc-exe`: The real path of the executable from `/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/exe`- `proc-exe-version`: The version of the executable from `/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/exe --version`#### FishGenerates a TSV file with the following columns:- `SHELL`: The value of `$SHELL`- `FISH_VERSION`: The value of `$FISH_VERSION`- `proc-exe`: The real path of the executable from `/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/exe`- `proc-exe-version`: The version of the executable from `/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/exe --version`### `job.runinfo.time`The time spent on the job, and more, generated by `time -v` command.### `job.runinfo.device`The device (cpu and memory) information of the job, generated by `lscpu`/`lsmem` command.[1]: https://github.com/pwwang/pipen</longdescription>
