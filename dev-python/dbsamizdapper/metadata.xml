	<longdescription># DbsamizdapperThe &quot;blissfully naive PostgreSQL database object manager&quot;This is based on the original `dbsamizdat` code from https://git.sr.ht/~nullenenenen/DBSamizdat/ a version of which was previously hosted at `https://github.com/catalpainternational/dbsamizdat`Full disclosure: That one (https://git.sr.ht/~nullenenenen/DBSamizdat/ which is also on pypi) is definitely less likely to have bugs, it was written by a better coder than I am, the original author is &quot;nullenenenen &lt;nullenenenen@gavagai.eu&gt;&quot;## New featuresThis fork is based on a rewrite which I did to better understand the internals of `dbsamizdat` as we use it in a few different projects. The changes include: - A target pyver of about ~3.10 - Type hints throughout the codebase - Changed from `ABC` to `Protocol` type for inheritance - Poetry for dependency and build management - Compat with both `psycopg` and `psycopg3` - Opinionated code formatting   - black + isort   - replaced `lambda`s - some simple `pytest` functionsand probably many more undocumented changes## Running TestsSpin up a docker container`docker run -p 5435:5432 -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust postgres:latest`The db url for this container would be:&quot;postgresql:///postgres@localhost:5435/postgres&quot;Make this the environment variable `DB_URL`, or add it to the `.env` file## Original READMECheck out the original readme for rationale and how-to documentation</longdescription>
