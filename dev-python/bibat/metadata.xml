Bibat also aims to promotesoftware quality by providing a modular, automated and reproducible project thattakes advantage of and integrates together the most up to date statisticalsoftware.Bibat comes with &quot;batteries included&quot; in the sense that it creates a workingexample project, which the user can adapt so that it implements their desiredanalysis. We believe this style of template makes for better usability andeasier testing of Bayesian workflow projects compared with the alternativeapproach of providing an incomplete skeleton project.Documentation=============Check out bibat's documentation at `https://bibat.readthedocs.io&lt;https://bibat.readthedocs.io&gt;`_.In particular, you may find it useful to have a look at `this vignette&lt;https://bibat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/report.html&gt;`_ thatdemonstrates, step by step, how to use bibat to implement a complex statisticalanalysis.Installation============You can install bibat like this (make sure you are in a Python environment whereyou would like to install bibat):.. code:: sh    $ pip install bibatTo install the latest version of bibat from github:.. code:: sh    $ pip install git+https://github.com/teddygroves/bibat.git@mainTo install bibat with development dependencies:.. code:: sh    $ pip install bibat'[development]'Usage=====Bibat is intended to be used from the command line like this:.. code:: sh    $ bibatRunning this command will trigger a command line wizard. After following thewizard's instructions, a new directory will be created that implements a simplestatistical analysis. To try out the example analysis, run the followingcommand from the root of the new directory:.. code:: sh    $ make analysisIf you already know how you are going to answer the wizard's questions, you canput your answers in a json file with relative path `my_json_file.json` and runbibat like this:.. code:: sh    $ bibat --config_file=my_json_file.jsonSee `bibat's cookiecutter schema&lt;https://github.com/teddygroves/bibat/blob/main/bibat/cookiecutter.json&gt;`_ forthe information you need to create a suitable json file.Dependencies============Bibat's dependencies fall into two categories: a few that are required by bibatitself, and some more that are required in order to run the analyses that bibatgenerates.Dependencies required by bibat------------------------------Bibat requires Python version 3.9 or greater.Bibat's other dependencies are all Python packages. These can be found inbibat's `pyproject.toml file&lt;https://github.com/teddygroves/bibat/blob/main/pyproject.toml&gt;`_.The following packages are required in order to run bibat and are installedautomatically when you run :code:`pip install bibat`:- cookiecutter- click- pydanticBibat also has the following development dependencies, which can be installedby running :code:`pip install bibat'[development]'`:- black- isort- pre-commit- pytest- tox- codecov- pytest-cov- sphinx- sphinx-click- pydata_sphinx_themeTarget project dependencies: Python-----------------------------------Projects generated by bibat have their Python dependencies listed in the file:code:`pyproject.toml`.  The cookiecutter template that generates this file canbe found `here&lt;https://github.com/teddygroves/bibat/blob/main/bibat/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.repo_name%7D%7D/pyproject.toml&gt;`_.These packages will be installed when you run :code:`make env` or `makeanalysis` and are as follows:- arviz- cmdstanpy- jupyter- numpy- pandas- pandera- pydantic- scipy- scikit-learn- tomlIn addition, the following Python packages may be installed, depending on howthe user answers bibat's wizard:- pytest- black- sphinxTarget project dependencies: Cmdstan------------------------------------Bibat will attempt to install `cmdstan&lt;https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/index.html&gt;`__, the command lineinterface to Stan, when you run the commands :code:`make env` or :code:`makeanalysis` from the root of the target project.If bibat fails to install cmdstan, please raise an issue! The relevantparts of the `cmdstan&lt;https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/cmdstan-installation.html&gt;`__ and`cmdstanpy&lt;https://cmdstanpy.readthedocs.io/en/v1.1.0/installation.html#cmdstan-installation&gt;`_documentation might also be useful.Target project dependencies: Quarto-----------------------------------Bibat supports automatic generation of documentation using either Sphinx or`Quarto &lt;https://quarto.org/&gt;`_. Whereas bibat will install Sphinxautomatically, Quarto must be installed manually: see the `quartodocumnentation &lt;https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/&gt;`_ for instructions.Citation information====================If you would like to cite bibat using bibtex please use the following format:.. code:: sh  @software{bibat,    doi = {10.5281/zenodo.7775328},    url = {https://github.com/teddygroves/bibat},    year = {2023},    author = {Teddy Groves},    title = {Bibat: batteries-included Bayesian analysis template},  }</longdescription>
