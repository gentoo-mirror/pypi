	<longdescription># harmony-service-libA library for Python-based Harmony services to parse incoming messages, fetch data, stage data, and call back to Harmony## Installing### Using pipInstall the latest version of the package from PyPI using pip:    $ pip install harmony-service-lib### Other methods:The package is installable from source via    $ pip install git+https://github.com/harmony/harmony-service-lib-py.git#egg=harmony-service-libIf using a local source tree, run the following in the source root directory instead:    $ pip install -e .## UsageServices that want to work with Harmony can make use of this library to easeinterop and upgrades.  To work with Harmony, services must:1. Receive incoming messages from Harmony.  Currently the CLI is the onlysupported way to receive messages, though HTTP is likely to follow.  `harmony.cli`provides helpers for setting up CLI parsing while being unobtrusive to non-HarmonyCLIs that may also need to exist.2. Extend `harmony.BaseHarmonyAdapter` and implement the `#invoke` toadapt the incoming Harmony message to a service call and adapt the serviceresult to call to one of the adapter's `#completed_with_*` methods. The adapterclass provides helper methods for retrieving data, staging results, and cleaningup temporary files, though these can be overridden or ignored if a serviceneeds different behavior, e.g. if it operates on data in situ and does notwant to download the remote file.A full example of these two requirements with use of helpers can be found in[example/example_service.py](example/example_service.py). Also see[adapting-new-services](https://github.com/nasa/harmony/blob/main/docs/guides/adapting-new-services.md) for in depthguidance on service development using this library, especially the[info on proper error handling](https://github.com/nasa/harmony/blob/main/docs/guides/adapting-new-services.md#5-error-handling).## EnvironmentThe following environment variables can be used to control the behavior of thelibrary and allow easier testing:REQUIRED:* `STAGING_BUCKET`: When using helpers to stage service output and pre-sign URLs, this       indicates the S3 bucket where data will be staged* `STAGING_PATH`: When using helpers to stage output, this indicates the path within       `STAGING_BUCKET` under which data will be staged* `ENV`: The name of the environment.  If 'dev' or 'test', callbacks to Harmony are       not made and data is not staged unless also using localstack* `OAUTH_UID`, `OAUTH_PASSWORD`: Used to acquire a shared EDL token       needed for downloading granules from EDL token-aware data       sources. Services using data in S3 do not need to set this.       NOTE: If `FALLBACK_AUTHN_ENABLED` is set to True (CAUTION!)       these credentials will be used to download data *as* the EDL       application user. This may cause problems with metrics and can       result in users getting data for which they've not approved a       EULA.* `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`: The Earthdata application client ID.* `OAUTH_HOST`: Set to the correct Earthdata Login URL, depending on       where the service is being deployed. This should be the same       environment where the `OAUTH_*` credentials are valid. Defaults       to UAT.* `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`: A valid redirect URI for the EDL application.* `SHARED_SECRET_KEY`: The 32-byte encryption key shared between Harmony and backend services.       This is used to encrypt &amp; decrypt the `accessToken` in the Harmony operation message.       In a production environment, this should be injected into the container running the service       Docker image. When running the service within Harmony, the Harmony infrastructure will       ensure that this environment variable is set with the shared secret key, and the Harmony       service library will read and use this key. Therefore, the service developer need not       be aware of this variable or its value.OPTIONAL:* `APP_NAME`: Defaults to first argument on commandline. Appears in log records.* `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`: (Default: `&quot;us-west-2&quot;`) The region in which S3 calls will be made* `USE_LOCALSTACK`: (Development) If 'true' will perform S3 calls against localstack rather       than AWS* `LOCALSTACK_HOST`: (Development) If `USE_LOCALSTACK` `true` and this is set, will       establish `boto` client connections for S3 &amp; SQS operations using this hostname.* `TEXT_LOGGER`: (Default: True) Setting this to true will cause all       log messages to use a text string format. By default log       messages will be formatted as JSON.* `HEALTH_CHECK_PATH`: Set this to the path where the health check file should be stored. This       file's mtime is set to the current time whenever a successful attempt is made to to read the       message queue (whether or not a message is retrieved). This file can be used by a container's       health check command. The container is considered unhealthy if the mtime of the file is old -       where 'old' is configurable in the service container. If this variable is not set the path       defaults to '/tmp/health.txt'.* `MAX_DOWNLOAD_RETRIES`: Number of times to retry HTTP download calls that fail due to transient errors.OPTIONAL -- Use with CAUTION:* `FALLBACK_AUTHN_ENABLED`: Default: False. Enable the fallback authentication that  uses the EDL application credentials. See CAUTION note above.* `EDL_USERNAME`: The Earthdata Login username used for fallback authn.* `EDL_PASSWORD`: The Earthdata Login password used for fallback authn.## Development SetupPrerequisites:  - Python 3.8+, ideally installed via a virtual environment  - A local copy of the codeInstall dependencies:    $ make installRun linter against production code:    $ make lintRun tests:    $ make testBuild &amp; publish the package:    $ make publish## ReleasingGitHub release notes will automatically be generated based on pull request subjects.Pull request subject lines should therefore concisely emphasize libraryuser-facing behavior and updates they should appear in the changelog.  If moreinformation is needed for release notes, note that in the PR content.</longdescription>
