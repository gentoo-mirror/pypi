The DeviceManager allows you to search forconnected devices and you can store them into a dicitonary by a user-defined name. By this, you willnever have to guess the device's address again. The DeviceManager will search for updated addressesautomatically. So you will always know your device's address, even if it got a new address after itwas disconnected and reconnected. For this purpose, the DeviceManager is also serializable into aJSON-file. So your devices are not only stored within the session but also beyond and you have theability to share your device dictionaries with your colleagues.Currently supported device types are:- USB devices- Ethernet/LAN devices## InstallationTo install the DeviceManager, perform the following steps:1. Clone this repository```git clone https://github.com/zea2/DeviceManager```2. Navigate to the cloned repository```cd DeviceManager```3. Install the project   - To install the DeviceManager, you need to know if you want to use the *nmap*-functionality. If     not, install the package like this:     ```     $ pip3 install .     ```   - If you want to use *nmap* to get better results when searching for network devices, use this:     ```     $ pip3 install .[nmap]     ```     To use the *nmap*-functionality the *nmap*-software is required additionally:     - On Windows you will need to download the software from https://nmap.org/download.html     - On Linux *nmap* can be installed with `sudo apt-get install nmap`   On linux you eventually need to use the commands `pip3` or `python3` instead of `pip` or   `python`.## DocumentationYou can find a documentation on how to setup and use the DeviceManager on[readthedocs](https://devicemanager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). There you will also find someexamples, the API documentation on more...Some useful example notebooks are located at [docs/source/examples](docs/source/examples).</longdescription>
