You can alsospecify a pylintrc file.Sample Usage============.. code-block:: shell   py.test --pylintwould be the most simple usage and would run pylint for all error messages... code-block:: shell   py.test --pylint --pylint-rcfile=/my/pyrc --pylint-error-types=EF --pylint-jobs=4This would use the pylintrc file at /my/pyrc, only error on pylintErrors and Failures, and use 4 cores for running pylint.You can restrict your test run to only perform pylint checks and not any othertests by typing:.. code-block:: shell    py.test --pylint -m pylintAcknowledgements================This code is heavily based on`pytest-flakes &lt;https://github.com/fschulze/pytest-flakes&gt;`__Development===========If you want to help development, there is`overview documentation &lt;https://github.com/carsongee/pytest-pylint/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.rst&gt;`_Releases========0.21.0~~~~~~- Dropped support for pytest &lt; 7.0 in preparation for pytest 8.0 (should work with it when it comes out)- Dropped support for pylint &lt; 2.15 to work better with Python 3.11 and drop backwards compatibility code- Use baked in TOML support with fallback to newer tomli library thanks to `mgorny &lt;https://github.com/mgorny&gt;`__0.20.0~~~~~~- Corrected issues introduced by deprecations in pylint- Added support for Python 3.12 and dropped support for Python 3.7- Last version that will support pytest &lt; 7 and pylint &lt; 2.60.19.0~~~~~~- Switched to GitHub Actions for CI thanks to `michael-k &lt;https://github.com/michael-k&gt;`__- Switched to using smart PyLint RC discovery thanks to `bennyrowland &lt;https://github.com/bennyrowland&gt;`__- Correcting rootdir/rootpath issues in pytest &gt;7.x- Deprecated support for Python &lt;3.70.18.0~~~~~~- Added support for creating missing folders when using ``--pylint-output-file``- Now when pylint's ``ignore_patterns`` is blank, we don't ignore all files- Added cache invalidation when your pylintrc changes- Verified support for latest pytest and Python 3.9- Corrected badly named nodes (duplicated path) thanks to `yanqd0 &lt;https://github.com/yanqd0&gt;`__- Added tests to source distribution thanks to `sbraz &lt;https://github.com/sbraz&gt;`__0.17.0~~~~~~- Added support for latest pylint API &gt;=2.5.10.16.1~~~~~~- Corrected documentation and correctly pinned dependencies properly0.16.0~~~~~~- Switched to new ``from_parent`` API and added development documentation `dineshtrivedi &lt;https://github.com/dineshtrivedi&gt;`_- Added support for toml based configuration of pylint thanks to `michael-k &lt;https://github.com/michael-k&gt;`_0.15.1~~~~~~- Made `--no-pylint` functional again0.15.0~~~~~~- Added support for Python 3.8 thanks to `michael-k &lt;https://github.com/michael-k&gt;`_- Implemented option to output Pylint results to a reports file thanks to `jose-lpa &lt;https://github.com/jose-lpa&gt;`_- Refactored into simpler plugin structure0.14.1~~~~~~- Corrected pytest-pylint to properly support ``-p no:cacheprovider``  thanks to `yanqd0 &lt;https://github.com/yanqd0&gt;`__0.14.0~~~~~~- Added support for Pylint's ignore-patterns for regex based ignores  thanks to `khokhlin &lt;https://github.com/khokhlin&gt;`__- pytest-pylint now caches successful pylint checks to speedup test  reruns when files haven't changed thanks to `yanqd0  &lt;https://github.com/yanqd0&gt;`__0.13.0~~~~~~- Python 3.7 compatibility verified- Ignore paths no longer match partial names thanks to `heoga  &lt;https://github.com/heoga&gt;`__0.12.3~~~~~~- `jamur2 &lt;https://github.com/jamur2&gt;`__ corrected issue where file  paths where not being output properly on lint failures.0.12.2~~~~~~- Resolved issue where failing files weren't reported thanks to reports from  `skirpichev &lt;https://github.com/skirpichev&gt;`__ and `jamur2 &lt;https://github.com/jamur2&gt;`__0.12.1~~~~~~- Corrected a bug preventing this plugin from working with py.test &gt;= 3.7.0.0.12.0~~~~~~- `jwkvam &lt;https://github.com/jwkvam&gt;`__ added progress output during linting.0.11.0~~~~~~- Added option ``--no-pylint`` to override ``--pylint`` for cases when  it's turned on by default.0.10.0~~~~~~- `jwkvam &lt;https://github.com/jwkvam&gt;`__ provided support for pylint 2.00.9.0~~~~~- `noisecapella &lt;https://github.com/noisecapella&gt;`__ added an option to  run pylint with multiple processes0.8.0~~~~~- `bdrung &lt;https://github.com/bdrung&gt;`__ corrected inconsistent returns in a function- Dropped Python 3.3 support0.7.1~~~~~- Corrected path issue reported by `Kargathia &lt;https://github.com/Kargathia&gt;`_0.7.0~~~~~- Linting is performed before tests which enables code duplication  checks to work along with a performance boost, thanks to @heoga</longdescription>
