	<longdescription>[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/330427606.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/330427606)# Python modules for electron-phonon models![elphmod logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janberges/elphmod/master/logo/logo.svg)* `el` - tight-binding models from Wannier90* `ph` - mass-spring models from Quantum ESPRESSO* `elph` - electron-phonon coupling from EPW* `elel` - Coulomb interaction from VASP* `MPI` - work distribution and shared memory* `bravais` - lattices, symmetries, and interpolation* `dispersion` - diagonalization on paths and meshes* `dos` - 2D tetrahedron methods* `diagrams` - susceptibilities, self-energies, etc.* `occupations` - step and delta smearing functions* `md` - charge-density-wave dynamics using i-PI* `eliashberg` - parameters for McMillan's formula* `plot` - BZ plots, fatbands, etc.* `misc` - constants, status bars, parsing, etc.## InstallationTo install the latest version of elphmod:    python3 -m pip install elphmodAlternatively, to install the latest development version:    python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/janberges/elphmodelphmod can optionally be run in parallel via MPI (with shared-memory support).Using APT and pip, you can install the corresponding dependencies as follows:    sudo apt install libopenmpi-dev    python3 -m pip install mpi4py --no-binary=mpi4pyIf you plan to work on elphmod itself, we recommend to download the completerepository and also install the requirements of examples and documentation:    git clone https://github.com/janberges/elphmod    python3 -m pip install -r elphmod/requirements.txtAlso consider adding the absolute paths to `elphmod/elphmod` and `elphmod/bin`to the environment variables `PYTHONPATH` and `PATH`, respectively.## DocumentationThe documentation can be found at &lt;https://janberges.github.io/elphmod&gt;. It hasbeen automatically generated from the NumPy-style docstrings in the source codeusing Sphinx:    cd doc    make htmlPlease also have a look at the examples.## LicenceThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it underthe terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free SoftwareFoundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any laterversion.This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANYWARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR APARTICULAR PURPOSE.
