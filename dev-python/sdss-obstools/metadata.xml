	<longdescription># ObserverToolsThis is a home for Python 3 tools which came from the sdss-hub:~/bin directory. It is designed primarily for SDSS-V usage. Individual file documentation will be on confluence at &lt;https://wiki.sdss.org/display/APO/Observing+Scripts&gt;.## ModeratorsDylan Gatlin, Dmitry Bizyaev## AuthorsIn addition to the moderators who maintain this repo, scripts were written by the following authors: Elena Malanushenko, Jon Brinkmann, Viktor Malanushenko, Kaike Pan, Stephen Bailey, Bernie## InstallationFor observers at on their personal laptops, they can install these scripts via `pip install sdss-obstools`. The pip page can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/sdss-obstools/). This will install the scripts in your current pip environment. To run, you must have proper tunnels to Influx/sdss5 servers.## StructureFiles that were once under sdss-hub:~/bin are now under old_bin, and Python 3 scripts are now under bin. Any non-user tools are stored under python. All user tools have tests.## Code GuidelinesAll scripts designed for users should follow the SDSS Coding Standards, include a main function, and use argparse if arguments are needed. Prefer pathlib and fitsio. Scripts should try to be runnable on sdss-hub if possible. Anything in old_bin will be left there, but they are intended primarily for reference and you should avoid using them.If a script is moved to bin, it should have a test file in tests that will run it in a few ways that we will likely use it during normal observing. Tests are critical for us maintaining code dependability.## TODO  ### PythonThe best way of installing all dependencies is to create an pyenv environment. This project is usually tested on Python 3.9. All the requirements can be found in requirements.txt### UbuntuThese libraries were needed on Ubuntu 20.04```bashsudo apt install libxt-dev libbz2-dev saods9 xpa-tools```## LicenseObserverTools is licensed under a 3-clause BSD style license - see the LICENSE.md file.</longdescription>
