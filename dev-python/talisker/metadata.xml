It provides:  - structured logging for stdlib logging module (with grok filter)  - gunicorn as a wsgi runner  - request id tracing  - standard status endpoints  - statsd/prometheus metrics for incoming/outgoing http requests and more.  - deep sentry integrationIt also optionally supports the same level of logging/metrics/sentryintegration for: - celery workers - general python scripts, like cron jobs or management tasks.Talisker is opinionated, and designed to be simple to use. As such, it is notcurrently very configurable. However, PR's are very welcome!For more information, see The Documentation, which should be found at:https://talisker.readthedocs.io</longdescription>
