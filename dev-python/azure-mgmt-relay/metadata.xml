	<longdescription>## Microsoft Azure SDK for PythonThis is the Microsoft Azure Relay Client Library.Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the next generation of management APIsthat replace the old Azure Service Management (ASM).This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.For the older Azure Service Management (ASM) libraries, see[azure-servicemanagement-legacy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicemanagement-legacy)library.For a more complete set of Azure libraries, see the[azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).## UsageTo learn how to use this package, see the [quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)For docs and references, see [Python SDK References](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/)Code samples for this package can be found at [Relay Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&amp;term=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing&amp;terms=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing) on docs.microsoft.com.Additional code samples for different Azure services are available at [Samples Repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)## Provide FeedbackIf you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue inthe [Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)section of the project.![image](https://azure-sdk-impressions.azurewebsites.net/api/impressions/azure-sdk-for-python%2Fazure-mgmt-relay%2FREADME.png)# Release History## 1.1.0 (2021-09-06)**Features**  - generated by new autorest## 1.0.0 (2020-12-22)- GA release## 1.0.0b1 (2020-10-28)This is beta preview version.This version uses a next-generation code generator that introduces important breaking changes, but also important new features (like unified authentication and async programming).**General breaking changes**- Credential system has been completly revamped:  - `azure.common.credentials` or `msrestazure.azure_active_directory` instances are no longer supported, use the `azure-identity` classes instead: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/  - `credentials` parameter has been renamed `credential`- The `config` attribute no longer exists on a client, configuration should be passed as kwarg. Example: `MyClient(credential, subscription_id, enable_logging=True)`. For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in init documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)- You can't import a `version` module anymore, use `__version__` instead- Operations that used to return a `msrest.polling.LROPoller` now returns a `azure.core.polling.LROPoller` and are prefixed with `begin_`.- Exceptions tree have been simplified and most exceptions are now `azure.core.exceptions.HttpResponseError` (`CloudError` has been removed).- Most of the operation kwarg have changed. Some of the most noticeable:  - `raw` has been removed. Equivalent feature can be found using `cls`, a callback that will give access to internal HTTP response for advanced user  - For a complete set of  supported options, see the [parameters accept in Request documentation of azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#available-policies)**General new features**- Type annotations support using `typing`. SDKs are mypy ready.- This client has now stable and official support for async. Check the `aio` namespace of your package to find the async client.- This client now support natively tracing library like OpenCensus or OpenTelemetry. See this [tracing quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/core/azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry) for an overview.## 0.2.0 (2019-05-16)**Note**  - azure-mgmt-nspkg is not installed anymore on Python 3 (PEP420-based    namespace package)**Features**  - Client class can be used as a context manager to keep the underlying    HTTP session open for performance**General Breaking changes**This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*introduce breaking changes.  - Model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. All    positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments. To    keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for    Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 uses the &quot;*&quot; syntax for    keyword-only arguments.  - Enum types now use the &quot;str&quot; mixin (class AzureEnum(str, Enum)) to    improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.    While this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important,    and are documented here:    &lt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others&gt; At a glance:      - &quot;is&quot; should not be used at all.      - &quot;format&quot; will return the string value, where &quot;%s&quot; string        formatting will return `NameOfEnum.stringvalue`. Format syntax        should be prefered.  - New Long Running Operation:      - Return type changes from        `msrestazure.azure_operation.AzureOperationPoller` to        `msrest.polling.LROPoller`. External API is the same.      - Return type is now **always** a `msrest.polling.LROPoller`,        regardless of the optional parameters used.      - The behavior has changed when using `raw=True`. Instead of        returning the initial call result as `ClientRawResponse`,        without polling, now this returns an LROPoller. After polling,        the final resource will be returned as a `ClientRawResponse`.      - New `polling` parameter. The default behavior is        `Polling=True` which will poll using ARM algorithm. When        `Polling=False`, the response of the initial call will be        returned without polling.      - `polling` parameter accepts instances of subclasses of        `msrest.polling.PollingMethod`.      - `add_done_callback` will no longer raise if called after        polling is finished, but will instead execute the callback right        away.**Bugfixes**  - Compatibility of the sdist with wheel 0.31.0## 0.1.0 (2018-05-02)  - Initial Release</longdescription>
