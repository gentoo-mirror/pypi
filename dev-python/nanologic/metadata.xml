	<longdescription># Performing operations over logical expressionsCurrent implementation deals with logical expressions as computation graphs and performs some operations, such as:* Computation of truth table* Computation of index form for logical function* Computation of PCNF/PDNF* Computation of numerical from for PCNF/PDNF* Minimization of PCNF/PDNFCurrent implementation's functionality is extremely limited (it's basically a toy example) and this package is therefore not appropriate for any major use. All this was created as part of university work.You can find implementation in both [Python](https://github.com/alipheesa/nanologic/tree/main) (src repo) as well as in [IPython](https://github.com/alipheesa/University-Study/tree/main/OS/operations%20over%20logical%20functions/IPython).</longdescription>
