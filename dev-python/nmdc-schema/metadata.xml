This integrated platform facilitates comprehensive discovery of and access tomultidisciplinary microbiome data in order to unlock new possibilities with microbiome data science.This repository mainly defines a [LinkML](https://github.com/linkml/linkml) schema for managing metadata fromthe [National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC)](https://microbiomedata.org/).## Repository Contents OverviewSome products that are maintained, and tasks orchestrated within this repository are:- Maintenance of LinkML YAML that specifies the NMDC Schema    - [src/schema/nmdc.yaml](src/schema/nmdc.yaml)    - and various other YAML schemas imported by it,      like [prov.yaml](src/schema/prov.yaml), [annotation.yaml](src/schema/annotation.yaml), etc. all which you can find      in the [src/schema](src/schema/) folder- Makefile targets for converting the schema from it's native LinkML YAML format to other artifact  like [JSON Schema](project/jsonschema/nmdc.schema.json)- Build, deployment and distribution of the schema as a PyPI package- Automatic publishing of refreshed documentation upon change to the schema,  accessible [here](https://microbiomedata.github.io/nmdc-schema/)## BackgroundThe NMDC [Introduction to metadata and ontologies](https://microbiomedata.org/introduction-to-metadata-and-ontologies/)primer provides some the context for this project.## Maintaining the Schema**New system requirement: [Mike Farah's GO-based yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)**Some optional components use the Java-based [ROBOT](http://robot.obolibrary.org/) or Jena arq.Jena riot is also a part of the MongoDB dumping, repairing and validation workflow, if the user wishesto generate and validate RDF/TTL.See [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) for instructions on maintaining and updating the schema.## MakefilesMakefiles are text files people can use to tell [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction) (a computer program) how it can _make_ things (or—in general—_do_ things). In the world of Makefiles, those _things_ are called _targets_.This repo contains 2 Makefiles:- `Makefile`, based on the generic Makefile from the [LinkML cookiecutter](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-project-cookiecutter)- `project.Makefile`, which contains _targets_ that are specific to this projectHere's an example of using `make` in this repo:```shell# Deletes all files in `examples/output`.make examples-clean```&gt; The `examples-clean` _target_ is defined in the `project.Makefile`. In this repo, the `Makefile` `include`s the `project.Makefile`. As a result, `make` has access to the _targets_ defined in both files.## Data downloadsThe NMDC's metadata about biosamples, studies, bioinformatics workflows, etc. can be obtained from our nmdc-runtime API.Try entering &quot;biosample_set&quot; or &quot;study_set&quot; into the `collection_name` boxat https://api.microbiomedata.org/docs#/metadata/list_from_collection_nmdcschema__collection_name__getOr use the API programmatically! Note that some collections are large, so the responses are paged.You can learn about the other available collections at https://microbiomedata.github.io/nmdc-schema/Database/</longdescription>
