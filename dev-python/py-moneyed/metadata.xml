To address thatneed, the py-moneyed package provides the classes of Money and Currency, at alevel more useful than just using Python's Decimal class, or ($DEITY forbid) thefloat primitive. The package is meant to be stand-alone and used directly, orbe subclassed further. py-moneyed is BSD-licensed.Quick start-----------To install::    pip install py-moneyedUse:.. sourcecode:: python    from moneyed import Money, USD    five_dollars = Money(5, USD)You then use ``Money`` objects as if they were numbers, and they behavesensibly. See `docs &lt;https://py-moneyed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;`_ for moreinformation (or the ``docs/`` folder).History-------Some of the py-moneyed code was first derived from python-moneyavailable via this URL: http://code.google.com/p/python-money/Due to inactivity, it was forked by @limist in 2010 and latermoved to the py-moneyed organization.</longdescription>
