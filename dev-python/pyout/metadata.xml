	<longdescription>===========================================pyout: Terminal styling for structured data===========================================.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/pyout/pyout.svg?branch=master    :target: https://travis-ci.org/pyout/pyout.. image:: https://codecov.io/github/pyout/pyout/coverage.svg?branch=master    :target: https://codecov.io/github/pyout/pyout?branch=master.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg    :target: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT``pyout`` is a Python package that defines an interface for writingstructured records as a table in a terminal.  It is being developed toreplace custom code for displaying tabular data in in ReproMan_ andDataLad_. See the Examples_ folder for how to get started.A primary goal of the interface is the separation of content fromstyle and presentation.  Current capabilities include- automatic width adjustment and updating of previous values- styling based on a field value or specified interval- defining a transform function that maps a raw value to the displayed  value- defining a summary function that generates a summary of a column  (e.g., value totals)- support for delayed, asynchronous values that are added to the table  as they come inStatus======This package is currently in early stages of development.  While itshould be usable in its current form, it may change in substantialways that break backward compatibility, and many aspects currentlylack polish and documentation.``pyout`` requires Python 3 (&gt;= 3.7).  It is developed and tested inGNU/Linux environments and is expected to work in macOS environmentsas well.  There is currently very limited Windows support.License=======``pyout`` is under the MIT License.
