	<longdescription>VisPy: interactive scientific visualization in Python-----------------------------------------------------Main website: http://vispy.org|Build Status| |Coverage Status| |Zenodo Link| |Contributor Covenant|----VisPy is a **high-performance interactive 2D/3D data visualizationlibrary**. VisPy leverages the computational power of modern **GraphicsProcessing Units (GPUs)** through the **OpenGL** library to display verylarge datasets. Applications of VisPy include:-  High-quality interactive scientific plots with millions of points.-  Direct visualization of real-time data.-  Fast interactive visualization of 3D models (meshes, volume   rendering).-  OpenGL visualization demos.-  Scientific GUIs with fast, scalable visualization widgets (`Qt &lt;http://www.qt.io&gt;`__ or   `IPython notebook &lt;http://ipython.org/notebook.html&gt;`__ with WebGL).Releases--------See `CHANGELOG.md &lt;./CHANGELOG.md&gt;`_.Announcements-------------See the `VisPy Website &lt;https://vispy.org/news.html&gt;`_.Using VisPy-----------VisPy is a young library under heavy development at this time. Ittargets two categories of users:1. **Users knowing OpenGL**, or willing to learn OpenGL, who want to   create beautiful and fast interactive 2D/3D visualizations in Python   as easily as possible.2. **Scientists without any knowledge of OpenGL**, who are seeking a   high-level, high-performance plotting toolkit.If you're in the first category, you can already start using VisPy.VisPy offers a Pythonic, NumPy-aware, user-friendly interface for OpenGLES 2.0 called **gloo**. You can focus on writing your GLSL code insteadof dealing with the complicated OpenGL API - VisPy takes care of thatautomatically for you.If you're in the second category, we're starting to build experimentalhigh-level plotting interfaces. Notably, VisPy now ships a very basicand experimental OpenGL backend for matplotlib.Installation------------Please follow the detailed`installation instructions &lt;http://vispy.org/installation.html&gt;`_on the VisPy website.Structure of VisPy------------------Currently, the main subpackages are:-  **app**: integrates an event system and offers a unified interface on   top of many window backends (Qt4, wx, glfw, jupyter notebook,   and others). Relatively stable API.-  **gloo**: a Pythonic, object-oriented interface to OpenGL. Relatively   stable API.-  **scene**: this is the system underlying our upcoming high level   visualization interfaces. Under heavy development and still   experimental, it contains several modules.   -  **Visuals** are graphical abstractions representing 2D shapes, 3D      meshes, text, etc.   -  **Transforms** implement 2D/3D transformations implemented on both      CPU and GPU.   -  **Shaders** implements a shader composition system for plumbing      together snippets of GLSL code.   -  The **scene graph** tracks all objects within a transformation      graph.-  **plot**: high-level plotting interfaces.The API of all public interfaces are subject to change in the future,although **app** and **gloo** are *relatively* stable at this point.Code of Conduct---------------The VisPy community requires its members to abide by the`Code of Conduct &lt;./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md&gt;`_. In this CoC you will find theexpectations of members, the penalties for violating these expectations, andhow violations can be reported to the members of the community in charge ofenforcing this Code of Conduct.Governance----------The VisPy project maintainers make decisions about the project based on asimple consensus model. This is described in more detail on the`governance page &lt;https://vispy.org/governance/GOVERNANCE.html&gt;`_ of the vispywebsite as well as the`list of maintainers &lt;https://vispy.org/governance/MAINTAINERS.html&gt;`_.In addition to decisions about the VisPy project, there is also a steeringcommittee for the overall VisPy organization. More information about thiscommittee can also be found on the `steering committee page &lt;https://vispy.org/org/STEERING-COMMITTEE.html&gt;`_of the vispy website,along with the organization's `charter &lt;https://vispy.org/org/CHARTER.html&gt;`_ andother related documents (linked in the charter).Genesis-------VisPy began when four developers with their own visualization librariesdecided to team up:`Luke Campagnola &lt;http://luke.campagnola.me/&gt;`__ with `PyQtGraph &lt;http://www.pyqtgraph.org/&gt;`__,`Almar Klein &lt;http://www.almarklein.org/&gt;`__ with `Visvis &lt;https://github.com/almarklein/visvis&gt;`__,`Cyrille Rossant &lt;http://cyrille.rossant.net&gt;`__ with `Galry &lt;https://github.com/rossant/galry&gt;`__,`Nicolas Rougier &lt;http://www.loria.fr/~rougier/index.html&gt;`__ with `Glumpy &lt;https://github.com/rougier/Glumpy&gt;`__.Now VisPy looks to build on the expertise of these developers and thebroader open-source community to build a high-performance OpenGL library.----External links---------------  `User mailing   list &lt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vispy&gt;`__-  `Dev mailing   list &lt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vispy-dev&gt;`__-  `Chat room &lt;https://gitter.im/vispy/vispy&gt;`__-  `Developer chat room &lt;https://gitter.im/vispy/vispy-dev&gt;`__-  `Wiki &lt;http://github.com/vispy/vispy/wiki&gt;`__-  `Gallery &lt;http://vispy.org/gallery.html&gt;`__-  `Documentation &lt;http://vispy.readthedocs.org&gt;`__.. |Build Status| image:: https://github.com/vispy/vispy/workflows/CI/badge.svg   :target: https://github.com/vispy/vispy/actions.. |Coverage Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/vispy/vispy/main.svg   :target: https://coveralls.io/r/vispy/vispy?branch=main.. |Zenodo Link| image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/5822/vispy/vispy.svg   :target: http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17869.. |Contributor Covenant| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.0-4baaaa.svg   :target: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</longdescription>
