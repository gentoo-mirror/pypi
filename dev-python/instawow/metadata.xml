You can ``list`` add-ons and view detailed information aboutthem using ``list --format detailed``.For ``list`` and similarly non-destructive commands, the source can be omittedand the slug can be abbreviated, e.g. ``instawow reveal moli``will open the Molinari add-on folder in your file manager.Add-on reconciliation~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Add-on reconciliation is not automatic – *instawow* makes a pointof not automatically assuming ownership of your add-ons.However, you can automate reconciliation with ``reconcile --auto``and *instawow* will prioritise add-ons from CurseForge.Reconciled add-ons are reinstalled because the installed version cannot beextracted reliably.Add-on search~~~~~~~~~~~~~*instawow* comes with a rudimentary ``search`` commandwith results ranked based on edit distance and popularity.Search uses a collated add-on catalogue which is updated`once daily &lt;https://github.com/layday/instawow-data/tree/data&gt;`__.You can install multiple add-ons directly from search.Reverting add-on updates~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*instawow* keeps a log of all versions of an add-on it has previouslyinstalled.Add-on updates can be undone using the ``instawow rollback`` command.Add-ons which have been rolled back are pinned and will not receive updates.Rollbacks can themselves be undone with ``instawow rollback --undo``,which will install the latest version of the specified add-on usingthe ``default`` strategy.Profiles~~~~~~~~*instawow* supports multiple game versions by means of profiles.Assuming your default profile is configured for retail,you can create a pristine profile for classic with::    instawow -p classic configure&quot;``classic``&quot; is simply the name of the profile; you will be asked to selectthe game flavour that it corresponds to.  You can have several profilesof the same flavour (think alpha, beta and PTR).``-p`` is a global option. You can prefix any *instawow* command with ``-p``.For instance, to update your Classic add-ons, you would run::    instawow -p classic updateYou can omit ``-p`` for the default profile if one exists.Migrating Classic profiles^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^With the exception of &quot;Classic Era&quot; profiles(``vanilla_classic`` in *instawow* parlance), classic profiles will startreceiving updates for the latest Classic release once it is supported by*instawow*.  No user intervention is necessary, save for updating *instawow*.WeakAura updater~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*instawow* contains a WeakAura updater modelled after`WeakAuras Companion &lt;https://weakauras.wtf/&gt;`__.  To use the updaterand provided that you have WeakAuras installed::    instawow weakauras-companion build    instawow install instawow:weakauras-companionYou will have to rebuild the companion add-on prior to updatingto receive aura updates.  If you would like to check for updates onevery invocation of ``instawow update``, install the``instawow:weakauras-companion-autoupdate`` variant::    instawow install instawow:weakauras-companion-autoupdate    instawow updatePlug-ins~~~~~~~~*instawow* can be extended using plug-ins.  Plug-ins can be used to add supportfor arbitrary hosts and add new commands to the CLI.  You will find a sampleplug-in in ``tests/plugin``.Metadata sourcing-----------------CurseForge~~~~~~~~~~CurseForge is set to retire its unauthenticated add-on API by the end of Q1 2022.CurseForge will be issuing keys for the new API conditionally and whichadd-on managers are obligated to conceal.The new API is therefore unworkable for add-on managers except through aproxy service, which the author of this particular add-on manager cannot afford.At the same time, CurseForge will be providing the option for authors to unlisttheir add-ons from the new API, and downloads intitiated through the new APIwill not count towards author credits for the ad revenue sharing programme.GitHub~~~~~~*instawow* supports WoW add-ons *released* on GitHub – that is to say thatthe repository must have a release (tags won't work) and the release musthave an add-on ZIP file attached to it as an asset.*instawow* will not install or build add-ons directly fromsource, or from tarballs or 'zipballs', and will not validatethe contents of the ZIP file.Transparency------------Web requests initiated by *instawow* can be identified by its user agent string.Every 24 hours, on launch, *instawow* will query `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org&gt;`__ –the canonical Python package index – to check for *instawow* updates.Contributing------------Bug reports and fixes are welcome.  Do open an issue before committing tomaking any significant changes.Related work------------The author of `strongbox &lt;https://github.com/ogri-la/strongbox&gt;`__ has beencataloguing similar software.  If you are unhappywith *instawow*, you might find one of these`other &lt;https://ogri-la.github.io/wow-addon-managers/&gt;`__ add-on managers moreto your liking.</longdescription>
