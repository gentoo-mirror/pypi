Open a terminal (ideally with a `python` virtual environment activate) ### 1. Install from PipEnter the command below and press 'Enter'```bashpip install skellycam```### 2. Launch SkellyCam GUIEnter the command below and press 'Enter'```bashskellycam```### 3. Success! ðŸ’€ðŸ“¸âœ¨Hopefully a bunch of text scrolled by and a GUI popped up! If not, please [open an issue on the github repo](https://github.com/freemocap/skellycam/issues) and we'll try to help you out :) ## Limitation (aka TO DO)  -- Currently uses `opencv` to connect to cameras, so it won't recognize hardware that can't be connected with `cv2.VideoCapture` - Support for other camera hardware (e.g. FLIR) coming soon- Camera streams are not synchronized at run time, but are saved and synchronized after the fact. This is time-consuming process that requres frames be saved in RAM until the recording is done. Both of these weaknesses have solutions in the works.### New Python developers1) Install Python 3.102) Create  Virtual Environment3) Install `skellycam`#### To install Python 3.10[Windows Python3 Installation Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-install-from-the-full-installer)[MacOSX Python3 Installation Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#step-1-download-the-official-installer)[Linux Python3 Installation Guide](https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-python-on-ubuntu-linux-system/)### How to use#### RECOMMENDED -  Use the GUI!Launch the GUI by running `skellycam` in a terminal. This is currently the most tested method for interacting with the cameras.#### Example 1 - Connecting to a single Camera and showing the video feed[Example 1 Python Fle](skellycam/examples/example1_single_camera_connection.py)In this example, we connect a camera at index 0. Calling `show` allows us to view the cameras frames allowing usto see video.&gt; NOTE - Work in progress, no clean way to kill this window yet```pythonfrom skellycam import CameraConfig, Cameraif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    cam1 = Camera(CameraConfig(cam_id=0))    cam1.connect()    cam1.show()```#### Example 2 - Connect to all available cameras and record synchronized videos&gt; NOTE - Experimental and under development, might be unstable [Example 2 Python Fle](skellycam/examples/example1_single_camera_connection.py)```pythonfrom skellycam.experiments import MultiCameraVideoRecorderif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:    synchronized_video_recorder = MultiCameraVideoRecorder()    synchronized_video_recorder.run()```### Contribution GuidelinesPlease read our contribution doc: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)## Maintainers* [Jon Matthis](https://github.com/jonmatthis)* [Endurance Idehen](https://github.com/endurance)## LicenseThis project is licensed under the APGL License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.If the AGPL does not work for your needs, we are happy to discuss terms to license this software to you with a different agreement at a price point that  increases exponentially as you move [spiritually](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.html) away from the `AGPL`</longdescription>
