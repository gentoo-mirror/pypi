	<longdescription>PyVOLTHA========PyVOLTHA is a collection of shared Python libraries that are use tocreate Python-based`VOLTHA &lt;https://wiki.opencord.org/display/CORD/VOLTHA&gt;`__ DeviceAdapters and other Python utilities (CLI, …) that need to work with theVOLTHA v2.0 and later Golang core.Initially PyVOLTHA will target only Python 2.7, but contributors areencouraged to write or refactor any library methods to eventuallysupport Python 3.6.x or later.Installation instruction------------------------.. code:: bash   pip install pyvolthaRelease History---------------+---------+------------+-----------------------------------------------+| Version | Date       | Notes                                         |+=========+============+===============================================+| v0.1.0  | 2019-02-01 | Initial pypy release available.

This version has manually created protobuf definitions and will   probably not be very usable by any device adapters.-  This version is not under source control management at this time.   Initial VCS support is anticipated in the very near future when   portions of this project can be consumed by a device adapter   developer.-  Protobuf files in the ‘proto’ directory were hand copied over from   the voltha-go repository. These will eventually be in a separate repo   that developers will need to include.-  Most all import paths fixed but that does not mean everything works-  A fair number of original unit tests are working after import   changes. Others need work.</longdescription>
