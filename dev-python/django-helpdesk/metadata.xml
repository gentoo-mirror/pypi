All Rights Reserved.See LICENSE for details.django-helpdesk was formerly known as Jutda Helpdesk, named after thecompany which originally created it.

The demo projectresides in the `demo/` top-level folder.It's likely that you can start up a demo project server by runningonly the command::    make rundemothen pointing your web browser at `localhost:8080`.For more information and options, please read the `demo/README.rst` file.**NOTE REGARDING SQLITE AND SEARCHING:**The demo project uses `sqlite` as its database. Sqlite does not allowcase-insensitive searches and so the search function may not work aseffectively as it would on other database such as PostgreSQL or MySQLthat does support case-insensitive searches.For more information, see this note_ in the Django documentation.When you try to do a keyword search using `sqlite`, a message will be displayedto alert you to this shortcoming. There is no way around it, sorry.Installation------------`django-helpdesk` requires:* Python 3.8+* Django 3.2 LTS highly recommended (early adopters may test Django 4)You can quickly install the latest stable version of `django-helpdesk`app via `pip`::    pip install django-helpdeskYou may also check out the `master` branch on GitHub, and install manually::    python setup.py installEither way, you will need to add `django-helpdesk` to an existingDjango project.For further installation information see `docs/install.html`and `docs/configuration.html`Developer Environment---------------------Follow these steps to set up your development environment to contribute to helpdesk: - install a virtual environment     - using virtualenv from the helpdesk base folder do::          virtualenv .venv &amp;&amp; source .venv/bin/activate - install the requirements for development::    pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txtTo see option for the Makefile run: `make`The project enforces a standardized formatting in the CI/CD pipeline.
