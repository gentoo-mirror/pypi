	<longdescription># `toppra`: Time-Optimal Path Parameterization![Integrate](https://github.com/hungpham2511/toppra/actions/workflows/integrate.yml/badge.svg)- [Overview](#overview)- [Supports](#supports)- [Citing `toppra`](#citing--toppra-)# Overview**toppra** is a library for computing the time-optimal pathparametrization for robots subject to kinematic and dynamicconstraints.  In general, given the inputs:1. a geometric path `p(s)`, `s` in `[0, s_end]`;2. a list of constraints on joint velocity, joint accelerations, tool   Cartesian velocity, et cetera.**toppra** returns the time-optimal path parameterization: `s_dot(s)`, from which the fastest trajectory `q(t)` that satisfies thegiven constraints can be found.**Documentation and tutorials** are available[here](https://hungpham2511.github.io/toppra/index.html).You can install the package with pip:``` shellpip install toppra```To install from source for development:``` shellpip install -r requirement3.txtpip install -e .```# Support## Bug trackingPlease report any issues, questions or feature request via [Github issues tracker](https://github.com/hungpham2511/toppra/issues).Have a quick question? Try asking in our slack channel.## ContributionsPull Requests are welcome! Create a Pull Request and we will reviewyour proposal!# Credits`toppra` was originally developed by [HungPham](https://hungpham2511.github.com/) (Eureka Robotics, former CRIGroup) and [Phạm Quang Cưong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/cuong/)(Eureka Robotics, CRI Group) with major contributions from talentedcontributors:- [Joseph Mirabel](https://github.com/jmirabel) (C++ API)- EdsterG (Python3 support).If you have taken part in developing and supporting the library, feelfree to add your name to the list.The development is also generously supported by [Eureka Robotics](https://eurekarobotics.com/).# Citing toppraIf you use this library for your research, we encourage you to 1. reference the accompanying paper [A new approach to Time-Optimal Path Parameterization based on Reachability Analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318671280_A_New_Approach_to_Time-Optimal_Path_Parameterization_Based_on_Reachability_Analysis),   *IEEE Transactions on Robotics*, vol. 34(3), pp. 645-659, 2018.2. put a star on this repository.</longdescription>
