It provides functionality to create clients with desired configuration and middleware.**Disclaimer**: Please, be aware that preview versions of `msgraph-core` package are for testing purpose only. Do not use them in a production environment.## Prerequisites    Python 3.5+ (this library doesn't support older versions of Python)## Getting started### 1. Register your applicationTo call Microsoft Graph, your app must acquire an access token from the Microsoft identity platform. Learn more about this --   [Authentication and authorization basics for Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts)-   [Register your app with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2)### 2. Install the required packagesmsgraph-core is available on PyPI.```cmdpython -m pip install msgraph-corepython -m pip install azure-identity```### 3. Import modules```pythonfrom azure.identity import InteractiveBrowserCredentialfrom msgraph.core import GraphClient```### 4. Configure a Credential Object```python# Using InteractiveBrowserCredential for demonstration purposes.# There are many other options for getting an access token. See the following for more information.# https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/browser_credential = InteractiveBrowserCredential(client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID')```### 5. Pass the credential object to the GraphClient constructor.```pythonclient = GraphClient(credential=browser_credential)```### 6. Make a requests to the graph using the client```pythonresult = client.get('/me')print(result.json())```For more information on how to use the package, refer to the [samples](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-python-core/tree/dev/samples).## Telemetry MetadataThis library captures metadata by default that provides insights into its usage and helps to improve the developer experience. This metadata includes the `SdkVersion`, `RuntimeEnvironment` and `HostOs` on which the client is running.## IssuesView or log issues on the [Issues](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-python-core/issues) tab in the repo.## ContributingPlease see the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.rst).## Copyright and licenseCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
