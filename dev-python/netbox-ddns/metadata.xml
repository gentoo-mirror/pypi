	<longdescription># Dynamic DNS Connector for NetBoxThis plugin lets you define DNS servers that support [RFC3007 Dynamic DNS Updates](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3007).For each server you specify which domains and reverse DNS domains it is responsible for, and after that NetBox willautomatically send DNS Updates to those servers whenever you change the DNS name of an IP Address in NetBox.Updates are sent from the worker process in the background. You can see their progress either by configuring Djangologging or by looking at the Background Tasks in the NetBox admin back-end.For now all configuration is done in the NetBox admin back-end. A later version will provide a nicer user interface.## CompatibilityThis plugin in compatible with [NetBox](https://netbox.readthedocs.org/) v3.0.0 and greater, support for Netbox v2.11.0 is dropped in v1.1.4 due to UI implementation.## InstallationFirst, add `netbox-ddns` to your `/opt/netbox/local_requirements.txt` file. Create it if it doesn't exist.Then enable the plugin in `/opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py`, like:```pythonPLUGINS = [    'netbox_ddns',]```And finally run `/opt/netbox/upgrade.sh`. This will download and install the plugin and update the database whennecessary. Don't forget to run `sudo systemctl restart netbox netbox-rq` like `upgrade.sh` tells you!</longdescription>
