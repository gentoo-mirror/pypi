And then, there are two ways to build it:- Install source distribution from PyPI (Currently in developing, need to download models before build.)- Use setuptools to build and install into python package directly.- Use CMake directly (The old way)### Install from PyPI```shellpip install rife-ncnn-vulkan-python```### Use setuptools```shellpython setup.py install```### Use CMake#### Linux```shellgit clone https://github.com/ArchieMeng/rife-ncnn-vulkan-python.gitcd rife-ncnn-vulkan-pythongit submodule update --init --recursivecmake -B build srccd buildmake```#### WindowsI used Visual Studio 2019 and msvc v142 to build this project for Windows.Install visual studio and open the project directory, and build. Job done.The only problem on Windows is that, you cannot use [CMake for Windows](https://cmake.org/download/) GUI to generate the Visual Studio solution file and build it. This will make the lib crash on loading.One way is [using Visual Studio to open the project as directory](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/visual-cobol/vc50/VS2019/GUID-BE1C48AA-DB22-4F38-9644-E9B48658EF36.html), and build it from Visual Studio. And another way is build it from powershell just like what is written in the [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml)## About RIFERIFE (Real-Time Intermediate Flow Estimation for Video Frame Interpolation)https://github.com/hzwer/arXiv2020-RIFEHuang, Zhewei and Zhang, Tianyuan and Heng, Wen and Shi, Boxin and Zhou, Shuchanghttps://rife-vfi.github.iohttps://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06294## Usages### Example Program```pythonfrom rife_ncnn_vulkan_python import Rifefrom PIL import Imagewith Image.open(&quot;input0.png&quot;) as image0:    with Image.open(&quot;input1.png&quot;) as image1:      rife = Rife(gpuid=0) # or RIFE(0) like upstream      image = rife.process(image0, image1)      image.save(&quot;output.png&quot;)```If you encounter a crash or error, try upgrading your GPU driver:- Intel: https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers- AMD: https://www.amd.com/en/support- NVIDIA: https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx### Model| model | upstream version ||---|---|| rife | 1.2 || rife-HD | 1.5 || rife-UHD | 1.6 || rife-anime | 1.8 || rife-v2 | 2.0 || rife-v2.3 | 2.3 || rife-v2.4 | 2.4 || rife-v3.0 | 3.0 || rife-v3.1 | 3.1 || rife-v4 | 4.0 || rife-v4.6 | 4.6 |## Original RIFE Project- https://github.com/hzwer/arXiv2020-RIFE## Other Open-Source Code Used- https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn for fast neural network inference on ALL PLATFORMS- https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp for encoding and decoding Webp images on ALL PLATFORMS- https://github.com/nothings/stb for decoding and encoding image on Linux / MacOS- https://github.com/tronkko/dirent for listing files in directory on Windows- https://github.com/nihui/rife-ncnn-vulkan the original rife-ncnn-vulkan project</longdescription>
