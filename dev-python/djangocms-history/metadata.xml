	<longdescription>==================django CMS History==================|pypi| |build| |coverage|**django CMS History** is an addon application to provide undo/redo functionality in `django CMS&lt;https://django-cms.org/&gt;`_, by maintaining content history.Some of the functionality in this application was previously included in django CMS itself. However, it became apparentthat some users did not want it, and some wanted functionality that worked differently.In keeping with the django CMS philosophy of maintaining only core CMS functionality as part of the package itself,history management was removed from django CMS in version 3.4 and has been spun off into an independent application.django CMS History has been rewritten from the ground up. It will continue to be developed. New functionality andimprovements will be introduced in future releases... note::     This project is considered 3rd party (no supervision by the `django CMS Association &lt;https://www.django-cms.org/en/about-us/&gt;`_).
