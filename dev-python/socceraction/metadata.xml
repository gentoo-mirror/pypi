The general idea is to assign a value to each on-the-ball action based on the action's impact on the game outcome, while accounting for the context in which the action happened. The video below gives a quick two-minute introduction to action values.&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2175271/136857714-1d2c8706-7f2f-449d-818f-0e67fbb75400.mp4&lt;/div&gt;## FeaturesSocceraction contains the following components:- A set of API clients for **loading event stream data** from StatsBomb, Opta, Wyscout, Stats Perform and WhoScored as Pandas DataFrames using a unified data model.

The latest version officially supports Python 3.8 - 3.11.```sh$ pip install socceraction```The folder [`public-notebooks`](https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction/tree/master/public-notebooks) provides a demo of the full pipeline from raw StatsBomb event stream data to action values and player ratings. More detailed installation/usage instructions can be found in the [Documentation](https://socceraction.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).## ContributingAll contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.
