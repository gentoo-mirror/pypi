	<longdescription># Grai SQL Server IntegrationThe SQL Server integration synchronizes metadata from your SQL Server database into your Grai data lineage graph.Tests assume you have working installation of pyodbc and a supportedODBC driver installed on your host machine.## Installation NotesInstalling ODBC drivers can be particularly tricky on M1 machines.You'll need to install the unixodbc drivers through brew first```bash    brew install unixodbc```You can attempt installing pyodbc directly at this point though I was forced toset LDFLAGS and CPPFlags in my bashrc/zshrc file, i.e.```bashexport LDFLAGS=&quot;$LDFLAGS -L$(brew --prefix unixodbc)/lib&quot;export CPPFLAGS=&quot;$CPPFLAGS -I$(brew --prefix unixodbc)/include&quot;```At this point you should be able to `pip install pyodbc` successfullyand import the package from within python. However, you'll still require anODBC driver in order to connect with an MS SQL server. There are multiple optionsfor potential drivers but ODBC 18 from Microsoft has worked in testing.```bashbrew tap microsoft/mssql-release https://github.com/Microsoft/homebrew-mssql-releasebrew updateHOMEBREW_ACCEPT_EULA=Y brew install msodbcsql18 mssql-tools18```If you continue to experience issues you might try creating these symlinksbelow.```sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/etc/odbcinst.ini /etc/odbcinst.inisudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/etc/odbc.ini /etc/odbc.ini```When installing locally, if you get an error like `ImportError: dlopen(/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pyodbc.cpython-311-darwin.so, 0x0002): symbol not found in flat namespace (_SQLAllocHandle)`, you can try uninstalling `pip uninstall pyodbc` and then reinstall with build `pip install --no-binary :all: pyodbc`.</longdescription>
