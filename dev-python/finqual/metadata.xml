	<longdescription># finqualThis is a work in progress package that enables users to conduct fundamental financial research, utilising the SEC's data and REST API.## Featuresfinqual has the following features: - Ability to call the income statement, balance sheet or cash flow statement for any company on SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system.- Retrieve comparables companies for a chosen ticker on varying industry classifications (e.g. more general industry classifications or more detailed classifications)- Breakdown of chosen financial ratios for a chosen tickerThis has two key features that enable better programmatic access compared to other providers:- Ability to call up to 10 requests per second, with built-in rate limiter- No restriction on the number of calls within a certain timeframe## Quick-start guideThis provides section provides a quick overview on the functions available within the finqual package.```from finqual import finqual as fqfq.Ticker(&quot;TSLA&quot;).income(2020,2022) #Get annual income statements from 2020 to 2022fq.Ticker(&quot;TSLA&quot;).income(2020,2022, quarter = True) #Get quarterly income statements from 2020 to 2022fq.Ticker(&quot;TSLA&quot;).balance(2020,2022) #Get annual balance sheets from 2020 to 2022fq.Ticker(&quot;TSLA&quot;).balance(2020,2022, quarter = True) #Get quarterly balance sheets from 2020 to 2022fq.Ticker(&quot;TSLA&quot;).cashflow(2020,2022) #Get annual cash flow statements from 2020 to 2022fq.Ticker(&quot;TSLA&quot;).cashflow(2020,2022) #Get quarterly cash flow statements from 2020 to 2022fq.Ticker(&quot;TSLA&quot;).ratios(2018,2020) #Get selected financial ratios and the average from 2020 to 2022fq.Ticker(&quot;TSLA&quot;).comparables(5) #Get five comparable companies for TSLA (by market cap) that are in the same 4 digit SIC industry classificationfq.Ticker(&quot;TSLA&quot;).comparables(5,3) #Get five comparable companies for TSLA (by market cap) that are in the same 3 digit SIC industry classification```## In-depth guideFirst, ensure that the required packages are installed (see the &quot;Dependencies&quot; section). Then, import the package using:```from finqual import finqual as fq```From there, we use this initalised &quot;Ticker&quot; instance to call the desired function. These functions are:```&quot;&quot;&quot;Financial statement functions&quot;&quot;&quot;fq.Ticker(&quot;TSLA&quot;).income(start, end, quarter = None)fq.Ticker(&quot;TSLA&quot;).balance(start, end, quarter = None)fq.Ticker(&quot;TSLA&quot;).cashflow(start, end, quarter = None)&quot;&quot;&quot;Other fundamental financial research functions&quot;&quot;&quot;fq.Ticker(&quot;TSLA&quot;).ratios(start, end)fq.Ticker(&quot;TSLA&quot;).comparables(n, level = None)```The financial statement functions (`income`, `balance` and `cashflow`) takes a mandatory timeframe input (`start` and `end`), and then an optional input to return the quarterly results within that timeframe, otherwise defaulting to returning annual results.The `ratios` function calculates selected financial ratios for the specified timeframe and returns the mean average over that timeframe. The selected financial ratios are a selection of liquidity, profitability and valuation ratios, which are commonly used to compare against other companies,The `comparables` function returns a list of `n` comparable companies based on the SIC code of the initialized ticker (i.e. companies in the same industry as the chosen company). The comparable companies are selected based on market capitalisation, and users can adjust the optional input `level` to determine the number of SIC digits to consider, whereby level takes an integer from 1 to 4, with 4 being the default and the most granular industry classification possible.## DependenciesOnly four packages are required, with the following versions confirmed to be working:| Package   | Version  ||-----------|----------|| pandas    | &gt;= 2.0.2  || numpy     | &gt;= 1.24.3 || requests  | &gt;= 2.31.0 || ratelimit | &gt;= 2.2.1  || datetime  | &gt;= 5.1    |## LimitationsCurrently, there are several known limitations that I am aware of from my own testing. These are still to be looked at:- Missing data values for companies, this is mostly due to companies using custom tags that are not accessible via the SEC database- Banks and financial institutions have different balance sheets compared to other normal companies, so a standardised balance sheet for banks and similar firms is still to be looked at</longdescription>
