To avoid this check, add the flag `--no-db` at the end of a command. In extreme cases (e.g. lost collection), you can run `qobuz-dl -p` to completely reset the database.## Usage```usage: qobuz-dl [-h] [-r] {fun,dl,lucky} ...The ultimate Qobuz music downloader.See usage examples on https://github.com/vitiko98/qobuz-dloptional arguments:  -h, --help      show this help message and exit  -r, --reset     create/reset config file  -p, --purge     purge/delete downloaded-IDs databasecommands:  run qobuz-dl &lt;command&gt; --help for more info  (e.g. qobuz-dl fun --help)  {fun,dl,lucky}    fun           interactive mode    dl            input mode    lucky         lucky mode```## Module usage Using `qobuz-dl` as a module is really easy.
