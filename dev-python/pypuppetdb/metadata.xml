Valid values are    &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;'v1'&lt;/span&gt; for PuppetDB \&lt;= 6.9.0,    &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;'v2'&lt;/span&gt; for PuppetDB \&gt;= 6.9.1 or    &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt; which defaults to    &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;'v2'&lt;/span&gt;.  - Added a mew parameter &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt; to the    &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;metric()&lt;/span&gt; function that allows    overriding the version of the metric API being queried for that    individual call. If nothing is specified it will default to the    &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;self.metric\_api\_version&lt;/span&gt; of the    class, else it expects a value of    &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;'v1'&lt;/span&gt; or    &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;'v2'&lt;/span&gt; same as the    &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;metric\_api\_version&lt;/span&gt; class parameter.  - Added new &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt; parameter to    &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;\_query()&lt;/span&gt; to allow users to send    arbitrary payloads with their queries (useful for debugging).2.0.0-----  - Dropping old python 2.7/3.5 and ensuring 3 latest versions are    supported  - Adding mypy + cleanup + further removal of python2 code  - Bugfix: Httpretty is not used outside tests and breaks install on    newer python versions for some systems1.2.0-----  - Add option to get nodes without using event-counts  - define the project status as stable  - bundle requirements-test.txt in python package1.1.0-----  - deduplicate dependencylist  - QueryBuilder.py: Use native data structures for internal    representation  - Add support for the Command API, /pdb/cmd/v1. Added \_cmd alongside    \_query to minimise changes to original code1.0.0-----  - Bump dependencies  - QueryBuilder: Added support for FromOperator, arrays and    FromOperator  - New endpoint: status  - POST query in request body  - Simplify JSON encoding for POST  - Upload and publish is built in to setuptools0.3.3-----  - Add support for authentication with tokens  - Fix bug with parsing results from inventory endpoint0.3.2-----  - Fixed noop puppet runs reporting unchanged instead of noop.  - Fixed unreported nodes shown as 'noop' in puppetdb \&gt; 4.1.0.  - Add Inventory API endpoint for PuppetDB 4.2.0.  - Support for producer field on catalogs, facts and report types.0.3.1-----  - Fixed a datetime related bug in    &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;pypuppetdb.api.nodes()&lt;/span&gt; that caused    all returned nodes to be an unreported status0.3.0-----  - New QueryBuilder module allows users to build PuppetDB queries in an    Object-Oriented fashion.  - Adding support for new fields provided in PuppetDB 4.1.0.0.2.3-----  - Removed deprecation of    &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;pypuppetdb.types.Report.events()&lt;/span&gt;.    Expanded resource events data timestamps are not parseable.  - Escaping additional path parameters passed to \_url() with    urllib.quote0.2.2-----  - Fixed URL Encoding found when querying the specific value of a    macaddress fact.  - Adding support for PuppetDB 4.0.0 information. Namely Adding a    catalog\_uuid attribute to the Catalog type object. Adding code\_id,    catalog\_uuid and cached\_catalog\_status attributes to the Report    type object.  - Removing unneeded sudo option from .travis.yml, this gave    unnecessary warning in the test environment.  - Updating the files under docs/ so    &lt;https://pypuppetdb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&gt; can be updated  - Deprecating    &lt;span class=&quot;title-ref&quot;&gt;pypuppetdb.types.Report.events()&lt;/span&gt; in    favour of the new events list variable.  - Renaming test-requirements.txt to requirements.txt0.2.1-----  - Adding a version comparison utility function using examples provided    in    &lt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1714027/version-number-comparison&gt;  - Adding a new variable latest\_report\_hash to the Node object.    Default None but is given a real value from the field of the same    name in the Nodes endpoint available in PuppetDB 3.2 or higher.  - Allowing support for 'GET' AND 'POST' requests in the api \_query()    function. This will allow clients to send requests to the PuppetDB    that are too long for a GEt request query string  - Adding a node field, code\_id, to the Catalog object using the field    of the same name from the Catalogs endpoint (currently unused as of    PuppetDB 3.2.2)  - Adding test cases for new features EXCEPT the GET and POST update.0.2.0-----  - Version bump to 0.2.0  - Adding support for v4 of the Query API  - Removing v2 and v3 api functions as per changelog  - pypuppetdb will no longer support multiple API versions, removing    the api\_version attribute from pypuppetdb.connect()  - All clients must remove the api\_version attribute from the connect    function, or the starting number, since it is no longer supported  - Removing all NotImplemented errors in the function of BaseAPI and    filled them with the real code**New Features**New endpoints:  - `environments`: `environments()`  - `factsets`: `factsets()`  - `fact-paths`: `fact_paths()`  - `fact-contents`: `fact_contents()`  - `edges`: `edges()`Changes to Types:  - `pypupperdb.types.Report` now requires `api` to be passed as the    second argument, this allows to directly query for any events that    occurred in this report object. This functionality was proposed and    denied because of backward compatability reasons, since the previous    versions are now removed this is no longer a problem.  - All `pypupperdb.types.*` accept the v4 API information as optional    parameters. These parameters are primarily environment related but    may include additional information if provided from that endpoint.  - Functions appearing inside `pypuppetdb.types` that run queries    against the PuppetDB now accept and passing additional keyword    arguments to the query.  - All `pypuppetdb.BaseAPI` functions pass any received keyword    arguments to the `pypuppetdb.api.__init__._query()` function. This    allows for easy integration with paging functions and parameters.0.1.1-----  - Fix the license in our `setup.py`. The license shouldn't be longer    than 200 characters. We were including the full license tripping up    tools like bdist\_rpm.0.1.0-----Significant changes have been made in this release. The complete v3 APIis now supported except for query pagination.Most changes are backwards compatible except for a change in the SSLconfiguration. The previous behaviour was buggy and slightly misleadingin the names the options took:  - `ssl` has been renamed to `ssl_verify` and now defaults to `True`.  - Automatically use HTTPS if `ssl_key` and `ssl_cert` are provided.For additional instructions about getting SSL to work see the Quickstartin the documentation.**Deprecation**Support for API v2 will be dropped in the 0.2.x release series.**New features**The following features are **only** supported for **API v3**.The `node()` and `nodes()` function have gained the following options:  - `with_status=False`  - `unreported=2`When `with_status` is set to `True` an additional query will be madeusing the `events-count` endpoint scoped to the latest report. This willresult in an additional `events` and `status` keys on the node object.`status` will be either of `changed`, `unchanged` or `failed` dependingon if `events` contains `successes` or `failures` or none.By default `unreported` is set to `2`. This is only in effect when`with_status` is set to `True`. It means that if a node hasn't checkedin for two hours it will get a `status` of `unreported` instead.New endpoints:  - `events-count`: `events_count()`  - `aggregate-event-counts`: `aggregate_event_counts()`  - `server-time`: `server_time()`  - `version`: `current_version()`  - `catalog`: `catalog()`New types:  - `pypuppetdb.types.Catalog`  - `pypuppetdb.types.Edge`Changes to types:  - `pypuppetdb.types.Node` now has:      - `status` defaulting to `None`      - `events` defaulting to `None`      - `unreported_time` defaulting to `None`0.0.4-----Due to a fairly serious bug 0.0.3 was pulled from PyPi minutes afterrelease.When a bug was fixed to be able to query for all facts we accidentallyintroduced a different bug that caused the `facts()` call on a node toquery for all facts because we were resetting the query.  - Fix a bug where `node.facts()` was causing us to query all facts    because the query to scope our request was being reset.0.0.3-----With the introduction of PuppetDB 1.5 a new API version, v3, was alsointroduced. In that same release the old `/experimental` endpoints wereremoved, meaning that as of PuppetDB 1.5 with the v2 API you can nolonger get access to reports or events.In light of this the support for the experimental endpoints has beencompletely removed from pypuppetdb. As of this release you can only getto reports and/or events through v3 of the API.This release includes preliminary support for the v3 API. Everythingthat could be done with v2 plus the experimental endpoints is nowpossible on v3. However, more advanced funtionality has not yet beenimplemented. That will be the focus of the next release.  - Removed dependency on pytz.  - Fixed the behaviour of `facts()` and `resources()`. We can now    correctly query for all facts or resources.  - Fixed an issue with catalog timestampless nodes.  - Pass along the `timeout` option to `connect()`.  - Added preliminary PuppetDB API v3 support.  - Removed support for the experimental endpoints.  - The `connect()` method defaults to API v3 now.0.0.2-----  - Fix a bug in `setup.py` preventing successful installation.0.0.1-----Initial release. Implements most of the v2 API.\* *This Changelog was automatically generated by [github_changelog_generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator)*</longdescription>
