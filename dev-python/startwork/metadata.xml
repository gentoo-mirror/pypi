The real problem comes we you have to constantly switch contexts, even worse when working with multiple projects in multiple languages with totally different setups a couple of times a day.[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [DockerCompose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) are great tools to handle this problem. Start Work should not be a replacement for Docker either Docker compose and shall even work with both.With Start-Work will be easier to switch between projects from any folder and get your development environment up and running only by selecting the project you wanna work on, and when some of these projects for some reason don't allow  Docker, Start-Work will also try to identify which tools you are using and run it for you.## InstallationJust run:```bashpip install startwork```It's done, the installation can be verified with:```bashwork --version```## CLI Options```bashwork```Will display a list and let you select one of your saved projects&lt;br /&gt;```bashwork create```Will guide you with a couple of questions to save a new project.&lt;br /&gt;```bashwork delete```Will display a list and let delete one of your saved projects.Note: it will not remove the project from your computer, only from the list on Start-Work&lt;br /&gt;```bashwork --version```Show current version&lt;br /&gt;```bashwork --help```Show currently available CLI options## Next goals- [ ] Handle multiple environments in a single folder  - [ ] Detect multiple environments  - [ ] Let you choose the environment that will be run  - [ ] Let you mark multiple to run at the same time- [ ] Handle multiple folders  - [ ] When not matched by any setup pattern, check inside the first children's folders  - [ ] When multiple children folders match, let you choose one folder  - [ ] Let you mark multiple folders to run at the same time- [ ] Handle multiple folders AND multiple environments at the same call- [ ] Write fully covered end-to-end tests</longdescription>
