	<longdescription>=======Daemons=======**Well behaved unix daemons for every occasion.**Project Status==============*Consider this project to be in maintenance mode*.This project went v1.0.0 in 2014. Since then it has only received two patchesthat contained code changes. All other patches have been maintenance updatesto keep automated testing and static analysis running. I do not expect and amnot entertaining new feature asks.I will still respond to PRs and issues that address bugs or security issues.Please send these to https://github.com/kevinconway/daemons.What Is Daemons?================`Daemons` is a resource library for Python developers that want to createdaemon processes. The classes in this library provide the basic daemonization,signal handling, and pid management functionality while allowing for anyimplementation of behaviour and logic.Example Custom Daemon=====================.. code-block:: python    import time    from daemons.prefab import run    class SleepyDaemon(run.RunDaemon):        def run(self):            while True:                time.sleep(1)Now to create a simple init script which can launch the daemon... code-block:: python    #!/usr/bin/env python    import logging    import os    import sys    import time    from mypackage import SleepyDaemon    if __name__ == '__main__':        action = sys.argv[1]        logfile = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), &quot;sleepy.log&quot;)        pidfile = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), &quot;sleepy.pid&quot;)        logging.basicConfig(filename=logfile, level=logging.DEBUG)        d = SleepyDaemon(pidfile=pidfile)        if action == &quot;start&quot;:            d.start()        elif action == &quot;stop&quot;:            d.stop()        elif action == &quot;restart&quot;:            d.restart()There are more daemon types than the simple RunDaemon. Check the docs for more.Wrapping Existing Code======================Daemons can also be used to daemonize an arbitrary Python function... code-block:: python    import time    from daemons import daemonizer    @daemonizer.run(pidfile=&quot;/tmp/sleepy.pid&quot;)    def sleepy(sleep_time):        while True:            time.sleep(sleep_time)    sleepy(20)  # Daemon started with 20 second sleep time.The daemonizer also supports adding signal handlers. Check the docs for more.Daemon Functionality====================The daemons in the 'prefab' module come bundled with the following features:-   pidfile management-   signal handling-   start/stop/restart functionality-   unix process daemonizationThe default implementation of these feature are all driven by Python standardlibrary modules. Each component may be overridden or extended by adding anotherbase class to your daemon that implements the component interface. Check the'interfaces' package for items to implement.The 'prefab' daemons come in three flavors. The 'RunDaemon' requires that youimplement the 'run' method which should use some form of a loop. If the 'run'method completes the process will stop. The 'StepDaemon' requires that youimplement the 'step' method. The process will call 'step' on an infinite loop.The eventlet and gevent message daemons require that you implement the'get_message' and 'handle_message' methods. These will fetch and handlemessages within green-threads.License=======::    Copyright 2013 Kevin Conway    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;);    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
