For preprocessing, we currently support Spark as the main tool to carry out the task.If you have any questions or would like to contribute, join our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/squirrel-core/shared_invite/zt-14k6sk6sw-zQPHfqAI8Xq5WYd~UqgNFw)!## InstallationInstall `squirrel-core` and `squirrel-datasets-core` with pip. Note that you can install with different dependencies based on your requirements for squirrel drivers.For using the Torchvision driver call:```shellpip install &quot;squirrel-core[torch]&quot;pip install &quot;squirrel-datasets-core[torchvision]&quot;```For using the Huggingface or Deeplake driver call:```shellpip install &quot;squirrel-datasets-core[huggingface]&quot;pip install &quot;squirrel-datasets-core[deeplake]&quot;```For using the Spark preprocessing pipelines call:```shellpip install &quot;squirrel-datasets-core[preprocessing]&quot;```If you would like to get Squirrel's full functionality, install squirrel-core and squirrel-datasets-core with all their dependencies.```shellpip install &quot;squirrel-core[all]&quot;pip install &quot;squirrel-datasets-core[all]&quot;```## Huggingface, Deeplake, Hub and Torchvision IntegrationA great feature of squirrel-datasets-core is that you can easily load data from common databases such as Huggingface, Activeloop Deeplake, Hub and Torchvision with one line of code. And you get to enjoy all of Squirrel’s benefits for free! Check out the [documentation](https://squirrel-datasets-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/driver_integration.html) on how to interface with these libraries.```pythonfrom squirrel_datasets_core.driver.huggingface import HuggingfaceDriverit = HuggingfaceDriver(&quot;cifar100&quot;).get_iter(&quot;train&quot;).filter(custom_filter).map(custom_augmentation)# your train loopfor item in it:  out = model(item)  # ...```## DocumentationVisit our documentation on [Readthedocs](https://squirrel-datasets-core.readthedocs.io).## Contributing`squirrel-datasets-core` is open source and community contributions are welcome!Check out the [contribution guide](https://squirrel-datasets-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute.html) to learn how to get involved. Please follow our recommendations for best practices and code style. ## The Humans behind SquirrelWe are [Merantix Momentum](https://merantix-momentum.com/), a team of ~30 machine learning engineers, developing machine learning solutions for industry and research. Each project comes with its own challenges, data types and learnings, but one issue we always faced was scalable data loading, transforming and sharing. We were looking for a solution that would allow us to load the data in a fast and cost-efficient way, while keeping the flexibility to work with any possible dataset and integrate with any API. That's why we build Squirrel – and we hope you'll find it as useful as we do! By the way, [we are hiring](https://merantix-momentum.com/about#jobs)!## CitationIf you use Squirrel Datasets in your research, please cite Squirrel using:```bibtex@article{2022squirrelcore,  title={Squirrel: A Python library that enables ML teams to share, load, and transform data in a collaborative, flexible, and efficient way.},  author={Squirrel Developer Team},  journal={GitHub.
