Currently, it provides an interface to common big-data neuroimaging databases such as [BossDB](https://bossdb.org), CloudVolume, DVID, and other standard formats.## Getting StartedTo quickly get started with intern, check out the wiki: [https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/intern/wiki](https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/intern/wiki)## DocumentationFull detailed documentation can be found here: [https://jhuapl-boss.github.io/intern/](https://jhuapl-boss.github.io/intern/)## Installation-   It's always a good idea to use virtualenv to isolate your work from your system Python installation:-   Using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/):```shellvirtualenv intern. intern/bin/activate```-   Using [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):```shellmkvirtualenv intern```-   (Preferred) Install via pypi```shellpip install intern```-   Install via gitClone the repository from https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/intern and run`pip install -r requirements.txt` from the repository's location on yoursystem.Add `&lt;repository location&gt;` to your `PYTHONPATH`.For example, on a \*nix system, if intern was cloned to ~/intern:`export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/intern`&gt; **For Python 2 support, you will need to install intern v0.10.0 or earlier.**### Optional DependenciesTo install depedencies required to use the [cloud-volume](https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume) remote, run the command: ```shellpip install intern[cloudvolume]```## ContributingPlease submit bug reports, or get in touch using GitHub Issues.## CitationIf you find this library useful to your work, please consider citing the following:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.098707v1```@article{intern,doi = {10.1101/2020.05.15.098707},url = {https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.098707v1},year = 2020,month = {may},publisher = {BiorXiv},author = {Matelsky, Jordan K and Rodriguez, Luis and Xenes, Daniel and Gion, Timothy and Hider Jr., Robert and Wester, Brock and Gray-Roncal, William},title = {{intern: Integrated Toolkit for Extensible and Reproducible Neuroscience}},journal = {BiorXiv}}```## The Boss Legal NotesUse or redistribution of the Boss system in source and/or binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:1.
