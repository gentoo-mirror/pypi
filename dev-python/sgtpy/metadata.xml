	<longdescription>SGTPy is an open-source python package of SAFT-VR-Mie and SAFT-Gamma-Mie Equations of State (EOS).SGTPy allows to work with pure fluids and fluid mixtures, additionally the fluidscan be modeled considering association, cross-association and polar contributions.SGTPy was built on top of phasepy's phase equilibrium and SquareGradient Theory (SGT) functions. These functions were updated to speed-upcalculations of associative mixtures.SGTPy relies on Numpy, SciPy and PhasePy.</longdescription>
