	<longdescription># FastGedcomA lightweight tool to parse, browse and edit gedcom files.Install FastGedcom using pip from [its PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/fastgedcom/):```bashpip install fastgedcom```## FeaturesEasy to write! Free choice of fields, data, and formatting.```pythonfrom fastgedcom.parser import strict_parsefrom fastgedcom.helpers import format_datedocument = strict_parse(&quot;gedcom_file.ged&quot;)birth_date = (document[&quot;@I1@&quot;] &gt; &quot;BIRT&quot;) &gt;= &quot;DATE&quot;print(format_date(birth_date))```The syntax is flexible and permissive. If you don't like magic operator overloads, you can use standard methods!It supports gedcom files encoded in UTF-8 (with and without BOM), UTF-16 (also named UNICODE), ANSI, and ANSEL.If a field is missing, you will get a [FakeLine](https://fastgedcom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/fastgedcom/base/index.html#fastgedcom.base.FakeLine) containing an empty string. This help reducing the boiler plate code massively. And, you can differentiate a [TrueLine](https://fastgedcom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/fastgedcom/base/index.html#fastgedcom.base.TrueLine) from a [FakeLine](https://fastgedcom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/fastgedcom/base/index.html#fastgedcom.base.FakeLine) with a simple boolean check.```pythonindi = document[&quot;@I13@&quot;]death = indi &gt; &quot;DEAT&quot;if not death:print(&quot;No DEAT field. The person is alive&quot;)# Can continue anywayprint(&quot;Death date:&quot;, format_date((indi &gt; &quot;DEAT&quot;) &gt;= &quot;DATE&quot;))```Typehints for salvation! Autocompletion and type checking make development so much easier.- There are only 3 main classes: [Document](https://fastgedcom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/fastgedcom/base/index.html#fastgedcom.base.Document), [TrueLine](https://fastgedcom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/fastgedcom/base/index.html#fastgedcom.base.TrueLine), and [FakeLine](https://fastgedcom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/fastgedcom/base/index.html#fastgedcom.base.FakeLine).- There are type aliases for code clarity: [Record](https://fastgedcom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/fastgedcom/base/index.html#fastgedcom.base.Record), [XRef](https://fastgedcom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/fastgedcom/base/index.html#fastgedcom.base.XRef), [IndiRef](https://fastgedcom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/fastgedcom/base/index.html#fastgedcom.base.IndiRef), [FamRef](https://fastgedcom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/fastgedcom/base/index.html#fastgedcom.base.FamRef), and more.## Why FastGedcom ?FastGedcom's aim is to keep the code close to your gedcom files. So, you don't have to learn what FastGedcom does, the data you have, is the data you get. The content of the gedcom file is unchanged. The data processing is optional to best suit your needs. FastGedcom is more of a starting point of your data processing than a all-round full-featured librairy.The name **FastGedcom** doesn't just come from its ease of use. Parsing is really fast. And, for getting the relatives of a person as fast as possible, there is the [FamilyLink](https://fastgedcom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/fastgedcom/family_link/index.html#fastgedcom.family_link.FamilyLink) class. [Here](https://github.com/GatienBouyer/fastgedcom/tree/main/benchmarks) are the benchmark I used.## Documentation and examplesWant to see more code?
