	<longdescription># Python Binding of SOLVESPACE Constraint Solver`py_slvs` is a Python binding of the 2D/3D geometry constraint solver from a[forked version](https://github.com/realthunder/solvespace) of[SOLVESPACE](http://solvespace.com/). The fork is based on SOLVESPACE v2.3, with some memory optimizationon Linux build. The Python binding is done using [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/)and modeled straight from SOLVESPACE's solver library (see [here](https://github.com/realthunder/solvespace/blob/python/exposed/DOC.txt)and [here](https://github.com/realthunder/solvespace/blob/python/include/slvs.h)),and is thus considered fairly low level.The binding is currently used to implement the primiary solver forFreeCAD [assembly3](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3) workbench</longdescription>
