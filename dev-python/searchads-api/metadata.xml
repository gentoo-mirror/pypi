Using the companyâ€™s industry-acclaimed Mobile Growth Stack as a strategic framework, Phiture team offers 4 key services: App Store Optimization, Apple Search Ads, User Retention services and Growth Consulting.# Apple Searchads API Library in PythonIn order to facilitate the usage of the Apple Search Ads API Phiture's Engineers have built a library in Python which allows users to manage campaigns, ad groups, keywords and creative sets. This library only requires intermediate Python skills and therefore makes it possible not only for Engineers but also for Data Analysts and Apple Search Ads Consultants to work with it.  While the library is extensive it is not complete and users are encouraged to commit suggestions.Read the docs on github.# Example Usage:Setup for v4 of the librarycreate a certs directory inside of your project folder, or create a different certs directory and specify it using the certificates_dir_path argument.         api = SearchAdsAPI(2134535, &quot;public.pem&quot;,&quot;private.key&quot;,          client_id=&quot;SEARCHADS.07875add-f6cd-4111-9c38-b84501d557c8&quot;,         team_id=&quot;SEARCHADS.07879add-d6cd-4111-9c38-b84501d527c8&quot;,         key_id=&quot;78a167b1-e423-4ab4-bcd1-8be75a4d7b7e&quot;, verbose=True)### Campaign Methods- Create a new campaign         res = api.create_campaign(1433439534, ['AU'], &quot;test&quot;, 1, 1, &quot;EUR&quot;)## Changelogversion 0.1.1 Added granularity level reportsversion 0.7.1 fixed some issues with granularityversion 1.1.1 added support for the v4 of the Apple Search Ads APIversion 1.2.1 refresh access_tokn only when neededversion 1.5.1 handles API error with Exceptionversion 1.5.3 fixed token update issueversion 1.6.1 added new product page, reporting, and Ad endpoints.
