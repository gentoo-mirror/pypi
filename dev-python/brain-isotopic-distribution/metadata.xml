	<longdescription>:mod:`brainpy` is a small Python library implementing the *B* afflingly *R* ecursive*A* lgorithm for *I* sotopic Patter *N* generation [Dittwald2014]_. It includes three implementations,a pure-Python object oriented implementation, a :title-reference:`Cython` acceleratedversion of the object oriented implementation, and a pure :title-reference:`C` implementation,listed in order of ascending speed. The C implementation is used by default when available.BRAIN, implemented in :func:`brainpy.isotopic_variants`, takes an elementalcomposition represented by  any :class:`~.collections.abc.Mapping`-like Python object and usesit to compute its aggregated isotopic distribution. All isotopic variants of the same numberof neutrons are collapsed into a single centroid peak, meaning it does not consider isotopicfine structure.Installing----------:mod:`brainpy` has three implementations, a pure Python implementation, a Cython translationof that implementation, and a pure C implementation that releases the :title-reference:`GIL`.To install from a package index, you will need to have a C compiler appropriate to your Pythonversion to build these extension modules. Additionally, there are prebuilt wheels for Windowsavailable on `PyPI &lt;https://pypi.org/project/brain-isotopic-distribution/&gt;`_:.. code-block:: sh    $ pip install brain-isotopic-distributionTo build from source, in addition to a C compiler you will also need to install a recent versionof `Cython &lt;https://pypi.org/project/Cython/&gt;`_ to transpile C code.References----------This package is an implementation of the algorithm originally described in    P.
