	<longdescription>## Typing stubs for jsonschemaThis is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)type stub package for the [`jsonschema`](https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema) package.It can be used by type-checking tools like[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses`jsonschema`.This version of `types-jsonschema` aims to provide accurate annotationsfor `jsonschema==4.19.*`.The source for this package can be found athttps://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/jsonschema. All fixes fortypes and metadata should be contributed there.This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.This package was generated from typeshed commit `9fb52127ab3eb4a1169d5ba5de070b62a8db4cc0` and was testedwith mypy 1.6.1, pyright 1.1.332, andpytype 2023.10.17.</longdescription>
