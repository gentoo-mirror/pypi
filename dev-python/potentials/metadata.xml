	<longdescription>==========potentials==========Introduction------------The potentials package provides a Python-based interface to the content hostedon the `NIST Interatomic Potentials Repository`_. The package directlyinteracts with the underlying database hosted at `https://potentials.nist.gov/`_allowing for the metadata for all hosted interatomic potentials to be searchedand explored.This package is integrated into `atomman`_ and `iprPy`_, which both extend thedatabase interactions provided here.  For example, atomman adds the ability tointeract with atomic structure records in the NIST database, and iprPy furtheradds the ability to interact with property calculation results.  See thedocumentation for those packages if you are interested in exploring more thanjust interatomic potential information.Installation------------The potentials package can easily be installed using pip or conda-forge    pip install potentialsor     conda install -c conda-forge potentialsDocumentation-------------The documentation for the potentials package consists of Jupyter Notebookscontained in the doc directory.  These describe the different componentsof the package and provide working examples.Basic Search Tools``````````````````- `0. Search Potential Entries.ipynb`_ |colab1| provides a user-friendly interface  for searching and exploring the known interatomic potentials.- `0. Search LAMMPS Potentials.ipynb`_ |colab2| provides a user-friendly interface  for searching and exploring the known LAMMPS interatomic potentials.  Parameter files can be downloaded, and the associated LAMMPS command lines  shown.In-depth Documentation``````````````````````More in-depth documentation can be found in the doc subfolder.  The Notebookslocated there provide information as to the design of the potentials package,how to change default settings, and options that are specific to the supportedrecord styles.Scripts```````The scripts subfolder contains additional Notebooks that relate to managingthe NIST database using the potentials package.  These are provided as examplesof using the potentials package for various tasks to help more advanced usersget started.  WARNING: The Notebooks in scripts are working documents and are notguaranteed to have 100% current code or data, and may have poor descriptions.   .. _NIST Interatomic Potentials Repository: https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/.. _https://potentials.nist.gov/: https://potentials.nist.gov/.. _atomman: https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/atomman/.. _iprPy: https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/iprPy/.. _0.
