More endpoints will be flushed out and completed as theyare discovered. If you find any, please submit a PR.NHL-api-py is a Python package that provides a simple wrapper around the NHL API, allowing you to easily access and retrieve NHL data in your Python applications.Note: This is very early, I created this to help me with some machine learningprojects around the NHL and the NHL data sets.  Special thanks to https://github.com/erunion/sport-api-specifications/tree/master/nhl and https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/stats-api.md.### Example Notebook:An example Collab notebook can be found [here at coreyjs/nhl-api-py-examples](https://github.com/coreyjs/nhl-api-py-examples).## InstallationYou can install NHL-py-api using pip:```shellpip install nhl-api-py```- - -## Usage```pythonfrom nhlpy import NHLClientclient = NHLClient()```Available methods:## Schedule```pythonclient.schedule.get_schedule() # returns today's gamesclient.schedule.get_schedule(date=&quot;2023-11-10&quot;) # returns games for supplied dateclient.schedule.get_schedule_by_team_by_month(team_abbr=&quot;BUF&quot;, month=&quot;2023-11&quot;) # returns games for supplied team and monthclient.schedule.get_schedule_by_team_by_week(team_abbr=&quot;BUF&quot;) # returns games for supplied team for current weekclient.schedule.get_season_schedule(team_abbr=&quot;BUF&quot;, season=&quot;20222023&quot;) # returns games for supplied team for supplied season```## Standings```pythonclient.standings.get_standings(date=&quot;2023-11-10&quot;) # returns standings for supplied dateclient.standings.get_standings(season=&quot;20222023&quot;) # returns standings for supplied seasonclient.standings.season_standing_manifest() # returns information about every season, start date, end date, etc.```## Teams```pythonclient.teams.team_stats_summary()client.teams.team_stats_summary(lang='fr')```- - - # Below is out of date, will be updated soon.As mentioned at the top, I created a notebook to go over some of the available methods in more detail.
