The style of the highlights can be customized in the _Advanced Settings Editor_.You can click on the status bar item to:- change language- enable spelling in the current documentSpellchecking in comments and strings in code can be configured in settings.The extension provides (Hunspell) [SCOWL](http://wordlist.aspell.net/) dictionaries for:- American, British, Canadian, and Australian English- French,- German (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)- Portuguese,- Spanishand will also use the Hunspell dictionaries installed in [known paths](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/spellchecker/search?q=OS_SPECIFIC_PATHS) which vary by operating systems.If you use JupyterLab in a browser running on a different computer than the jupyter server, please note that the dictionaries need to be installed on the server machine.You can add custom dictionary by placing Hunspell files it in `dictionaries` folder in one of the `data` locations as returned by:```bashjupyter --paths```You should place two files with extensions `.aff` and `.dic`, and name following [BCP 47](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646#section-2.1) standards.For more details, please see the [example](#adding-dictionaries---example) below.## JupyterLab VersionThe extension has been tested up to JupyterLab version 4.0.## InstallationFor JupyterLab 3.x and 4.x:```bashpip install jupyterlab-spellchecker```or```bashconda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab-spellchecker```For JupyterLab 2.x:```bashjupyter labextension install @ijmbarr/jupyterlab_spellchecker```### Adding dictionaries - exampleIf `jupyter --paths` looks like:```config:    /home/your_name/.jupyter    /usr/local/etc/jupyter    /etc/jupyterdata:    /home/your_name/.local/share/jupyter    /usr/local/share/jupyter    /usr/share/jupyterruntime:    /home/your_name/.local/share/jupyter/runtime```and you want to add Polish language, you would put `pl_PL.aff` and `pl_PL.dic` in `/home/your_name/.local/share/jupyter/dictionaries` (you will need to create this folder), so that the final structure looks similar to:```/home/your_name/.local/share/jupyter├── dictionaries│   ├── pl_PL.aff│   └── pl_PL.dic├── kernels│   └── julia-1.5│       ├── kernel.json│       ├── logo-32x32.png│       └── logo-64x64.png├── nbconvert│   └── templates│       ├── html│       └── latex├── nbsignatures.db├── notebook_secret└── runtime```#### Where to get the dictionaries from?Some good sources of dictionaries include:- [LibreOffice/dictionaries](https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries) GitHub repository- [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/deps/hunspell_dictionaries/+/master) repository- (if you know of any other quality resources please send a PR to add them here)#### Using online dictionariesAn alternative to saving the dictionary on your own disk (or more accurately on the disk where jupyter-server is set up)is fetching the dictionaries from a remote URL. This requires an Internet connection to load the dictionary(each time when you open JupyterLab or change the dictionary), and might be useful if you are not ableto save dictionaries on disk (e.g. when using JupyterLab on JupyterHub configured by someone else).To configure the online dictionaries go to _Advanced Settings Editor_ → _Spellchecker_and set `onlineDictionaries` to an array of JSON objects like in the example below:```json[  {    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;en_US-online&quot;,    &quot;aff&quot;: &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/codemirror.spell-checker/latest/en_US.aff&quot;,    &quot;dic&quot;: &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/codemirror.spell-checker/latest/en_US.dic&quot;,    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;My favorite variant of English&quot;  }]```## Contributing### Development installNote: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.```bash# Clone the repo to your local environment# Change directory to the jupyterlab_spellchecker directory# Install package in development modepip install -e .# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLabjupyter labextension develop . --overwrite# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changesjlpm run buildpip install pytest```You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.```bash# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when neededjlpm run watch# Run JupyterLab in another terminaljupyter lab```### Before commitMake sure that eslint passes:```bashjlpm run eslint:check```If there are any issues it might be possible to autofix them with:```bashjlpm run eslint```Run tests:```bashpython -m pytest```</longdescription>
