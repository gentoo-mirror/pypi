	<longdescription># glean-cliCommand-line tools for interacting with Glean (https://glean.io).## DevelopmentDuring local development, you likely want to point the CLI at your localGlean web server. You can do so with the following environment variable:```bashexport GLEAN_CLI_BASE_URI=http://localhost:5000```You should work with the Glean CLI in its own virtual environment. In thisnew environment, ensure you have `pip`, then do `pip install build` to getthe correct build tool.The Glean CLI is a project built by `setuptools`. You can package it forpublish with `python -m build`, or link it for local development by running`pip install --editable .` in the root folder of this repo.Once installed as an editable package, run `glean --help` to use it.</longdescription>
