Otherwise you might experience the following warningsat shutdown: `Waiting for background tasks to complete. (CTRL+C to force quit)`.Client disconnects need to be handled in your Request handler (see example.py):```pythonasync def endless(req: Request):    async def event_publisher():        i = 0        try:          while True:              i += 1              yield dict(data=i)              await asyncio.sleep(0.2)        except asyncio.CancelledError as e:          _log.info(f&quot;Disconnected from client (via refresh/close) {req.client}&quot;)          # Do any other cleanup, if any          raise e    return EventSourceResponse(event_publisher())```## Special use cases### Fan out ProxiesFan out proxies usually rely on response being cacheable. To support that, you can set the value of `Cache-Control`.For example:```pythonreturn EventSourceResponse(        generator(), headers={&quot;Cache-Control&quot;: &quot;public, max-age=29&quot;}    )```## Development, ContributingCheck `Makefile` for available commands and development support, e.g. run the unit tests:```pythonmake test```For integration testing you can use the provided examples in `tests` and `examples`.If you are using Postman, please see: https://github.com/sysid/sse-starlette/issues/47#issuecomment-1445953826## Changelog[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/sysid/sse-starlette/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)&lt;!-- Badges --&gt;[pypi-image]: https://badge.fury.io/py/sse-starlette.svg[pypi-url]: https://pypi.org/project/sse-starlette/[build-image]: https://github.com/sysid/sse-starlette/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg[build-url]: https://github.com/sysid/sse-starlette/actions/workflows/build.yml[coverage-image]: https://codecov.io/gh/sysid/sse-starlette/branch/master/graph/badge.svg[coverage-url]: https://codecov.io/gh/sysid/sse-starletteCopyright Â© 2020, [sysid](https://sysid.github.io/).All rights reserved.Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or withoutmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.* Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from  this software without specific prior written permission.THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS &quot;AS IS&quot;AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THEIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AREDISCLAIMED.
