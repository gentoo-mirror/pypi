This framework has been built from the ground up with community feedback and suggestions in mind. Our framework provides a modern and intuitive set of language bindings for easy interaction with Discord.## Key Featuresinteractions.py offers a wide range of features for building Python-powered Discord bots and web applications alike:- âœ… 100% coverage of the Discord API- âœ… Dynamic cache with TTL support- âœ… Modern and Pythonic API for easy interaction with Discord- âœ… Proper rate-limit handling- âœ… Feature parity with most other Discord API wrappers- âœ… Fully automated command synchronisationIn addition to core functionality, interactions.py provides a range of optional extensions, allowing you to further customize your bot and add new features with ease.## ExtensibilitySo the base library doesn't do what you want? No problem! With builtin extensions, you are able to extend the functionality of the library. And if none of those pique your interest, there are a myriad of other extension libraries available.Just type `bot.load(&quot;extension&quot;)`&lt;details&gt;    &lt;summary&gt;Extensions&lt;/summary&gt;   ### Prefixed Commands   Prefixed commands, message commands, or legacy commands.   Whatever you want to call them, by default the `interactions.py` library will not handle these. But rest assured this extension will get you going  - âœ… Automatic command registration  - âœ… Annotation support  ### Debug Ext  A fully featured debug and utilities suite to help you get your bots made  ### Jurigged  A hot reloading extension allowing you to automagically update your bot without reboots  ### Sentry  Integrates Sentry.io error tracking into your bot with a single line&lt;/details&gt;## Where do I start?Getting started with interactions.py is easy! Simply install it via `pip` and start building your Discord application in Python:`pip install -U discord-py-interactions````pythonimport interactionsbot = interactions.Client()@interactions.listen()async def on_start():    print(&quot;Bot is ready!&quot;)bot.start(&quot;token&quot;)```With interactions.py, you can quickly and easily build complex Discord applications with Python.
