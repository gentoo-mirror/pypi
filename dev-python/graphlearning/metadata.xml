	<longdescription>## Graph-based Clustering and Semi-Supervised Learning![Clustering](https://github.com/jwcalder/GraphLearning/raw/master/images/clustering.png)This python package is devoted to efficient implementations of modern graph-based learning algorithms for both semi-supervised learning and clustering. The package implements many popular datasets (currently MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10) in a way that makes it simple for users to test out new algorithms and rapidly compare against existing methods. Full [documentation](https://jwcalder.github.io/GraphLearning/) is available, including detailed example scripts.This package also reproduces experiments from the paperJ. Calder, B. Cook, M. Thorpe, D. Slepcev. [Poisson Learning: Graph Based Semi-Supervised Learning at Very Low Label Rates.](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/calder20a.html), Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Machine Learning, PMLR 119:1306-1316, 2020.## InstallationInstall with```shpip install graphlearning```Required packages will be installed automatically, and include numpy, scipy, sklearn, and matplotlib. Some features in the package rely on other packages, including [annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) for approximate nearest neighbor searches, and [torch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) for GPU acceleration. You will have to install these manually, if needed, with```shpip install annoy torch```It can be difficult to install annoy, depending on your operating system. To install the most recent version of GraphLearning from the github source, which is updated more frequently, run```shgit clone https://github.com/jwcalder/GraphLearningcd GraphLearningpip install .```If you prefer to use ssh swap the first line with```shgit clone git@github.com:jwcalder/GraphLearning.git```## Documentation and ExamplesFull documentation for the package is available [here](https://jwcalder.github.io/GraphLearning/). The documentation includes examples of how to use the package. All example scripts linked from the documentation can be found in the examples folder. ## Older versions of GraphLearningThis repository hosts the current version of the package, which is numbered &gt;=1.0.0. This version is not backwards compatible with earlier versions of the package. The old version is archived [here](https://github.com/jwcalder/GraphLearningOld) and can be installed with```shpip install graphlearning==0.0.3```To make sure you will load the old version when running `import graphlearning`, it may be necessary to uninstall all existing versions `pip uninstall graphlearning` before running the installation command above.## CitationsIf you use this package in your research, please cite the package with the bibtex entry below.```@software{graphlearning,  author       = {Jeff Calder},  title        = {GraphLearning Python Package},  month        = jan,  year         = 2022,  publisher    = {Zenodo},  doi          = {10.5281/zenodo.5850940},  url          = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5850940}}```## Contact and questionsEmail &lt;jwcalder@umn.edu&gt; with any questions or comments.## AcknowledgmentsSeveral people have contributed to the development of this software:1.
