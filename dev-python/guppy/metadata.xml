Contains especially the Glue protocol module.gsl       The Guppy Specification Language implementation. This can       be used to create documents and tests from a common source.heapy       The heap analysis toolset. It can be used to find information       about the objects in the heap and display the information       in various ways.sets        Bitsets and 'nodesets' implemented in C.</longdescription>
