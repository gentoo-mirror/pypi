Originally sourced from the Invokeproject's own project-management tasks file, they are now highly configurableand used across a number of projects, with the intent to become a clearinghousefor implementing common best practices.Currently implemented topics include (but are not limited to):- management of Sphinx documentation trees- Python project release lifecycles- dependency vendoring- running test suites (unit, integration, coverage-oriented, etc)- console utilities such as confirmation promptsand more.Roadmap=======While Invocations has been released with a major version number to signaladherence to semantic versioning, it's somewhat early in development and hasnot fully achieved its design vision yet.We expect it to gain maturity in tandem with the adoption and development ofInvoke post-1.x. It's also highly likely that Invocations will see a few majorreleases as its API (and those of its sister library, `patchwork&lt;https://fabric-patchwork.readthedocs.io&gt;`_) matures.For a high level roadmap re: when Invocations will get significant updates, seethe maintainer's `roadmap page &lt;http://bitprophet.org/projects#roadmap&gt;`_.Development===========This project uses the same dev methodology as Invoke proper - please see itsdevelopment page `here &lt;https://www.pyinvoke.org/development.html&gt;`_.</longdescription>
