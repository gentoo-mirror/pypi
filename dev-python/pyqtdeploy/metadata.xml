	<longdescription>pyqtdeploy - A Tool for Deploying PyQt Applications===================================================What is pyqtdeploy?-------------------pyqtdeploy is a tool that, in conjunction with other tools provided with Qt,enables the deployment of PyQt applications written with Python v3.5 or later.It supports deployment to desktop platforms (Linux, Windows and macOS) and tomobile platforms (iOS and Android).  Its design is heavily influenced by theneed to support mobile platforms and cross-compilation.An application being deployed is built from the application's source code and anumber of external *parts*.  A part is a pure Python module or an extensionmodule and is provided by a *component*.  A component is implemented as aplugin written in Python.  pyqtdeploy includes plugins for common componentsincluding, for example, PyQt, OpenSSL and the Python standard library.All external parts are installed in a *system root directory* or *sysroot*.The contents of a sysroot, ie. the components and how each is configured, isdefined by a ``sysroot.toml`` file.  This file is created and maintained byhand.  While each application being deployed must have an associated sysroot, asingle sysroot may provide the parts for multiple applications.  The firstof deploying an application is to specify an appropriate ``sysroot.toml`` file(but it is not necessary to build the corresponding target-specific sysrootdirectory at this point).pyqtdeploy comprises three different executables: ``pyqtdeploy-sysroot``,``pyqtdeploy-build`` and ``pyqtdeploy`` itself.``pyqtdeploy-sysroot`` is a command line tool that creates a target-specificsysroot directory using a ``sysroot.toml`` file.  It will download, configureand build the parts specified by each component.``pyqtdeploy`` is a GUI tool that is used to specify the type and structure ofthe application being deployed and the sysroot parts that it is dependent on.This information is stored in an application-specific project file (that has a``.pdt`` extension).``pyqtdeploy-build`` is a command line tool that takes the project file andcreates all the necessary files to build the deployed application.  It works bytaking the individual modules of an application, freezing them, and thenplacing them in a Qt resource file that is converted to C++ code by Qt's``rcc`` tool.  Python's standard library is handled in the same way.  It alsogenerates a simple C++ wrapper around the Python interpreter library that usesthe Python import mechanism to enable access to the embedded frozen modules ina similar way that Python supports the packaging of modules in zip files.Finally it generates a Qt ``.pro`` file that describes all the generated C++code.  From this Qt's ``qmake`` tool is used to generate a platform-specific``Makefile`` which will then generate a single executable.  Further Qt and/orplatform specific tools can then be used to convert the executable to aplatform specific deployable package.Author------pyqtdeploy is copyright (c) Riverbank Computing Limited.
