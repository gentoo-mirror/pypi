The lookups package is needed to create blank models withlemmatization data, and to lemmatize in languages that don't yet come withpretrained models and aren't powered by third-party libraries.When using pip it is generally recommended to install packages in a virtualenvironment to avoid modifying system state:```bashpython -m venv .envsource .env/bin/activatepip install -U pip setuptools wheelpip install spacy```### condaYou can also install spaCy from `conda` via the `conda-forge` channel. For thefeedstock including the build recipe and configuration, check out[this repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/spacy-feedstock).```bashconda install -c conda-forge spacy```### Updating spaCySome updates to spaCy may require downloading new statistical models. If you'rerunning spaCy v2.0 or higher, you can use the `validate` command to check ifyour installed models are compatible and if not, print details on how to updatethem:```bashpip install -U spacypython -m spacy validate```If you've trained your own models, keep in mind that your training and runtimeinputs must match. After updating spaCy, we recommend **retraining your models**with the new version.üìñ **For details on upgrading from spaCy 2.x to spaCy 3.x, see the[migration guide](https://spacy.io/usage/v3#migrating).**## üì¶ Download model packagesTrained pipelines for spaCy can be installed as **Python packages**. Thismeans that they're a component of your application, just like any other module.Models can be installed using spaCy's [`download`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#download)command, or manually by pointing pip to a path or URL.| Documentation              |                                                                  || -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- || **[Available Pipelines]**  | Detailed pipeline descriptions, accuracy figures and benchmarks. || **[Models Documentation]** | Detailed usage and installation instructions.                    || **[Training]**             | How to train your own pipelines on your data.                    |[available pipelines]: https://spacy.io/models[models documentation]: https://spacy.io/usage/models[training]: https://spacy.io/usage/training```bash# Download best-matching version of specific model for your spaCy installationpython -m spacy download en_core_web_sm# pip install .tar.gz archive or .whl from path or URLpip install /Users/you/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0.tar.gzpip install /Users/you/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0-py3-none-any.whlpip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0.tar.gz```### Loading and using modelsTo load a model, use [`spacy.load()`](https://spacy.io/api/top-level#spacy.load)with the model name or a path to the model data directory.```pythonimport spacynlp = spacy.load(&quot;en_core_web_sm&quot;)doc = nlp(&quot;This is a sentence.&quot;)```You can also `import` a model directly via its full name and then call its`load()` method with no arguments.```pythonimport spacyimport en_core_web_smnlp = en_core_web_sm.load()doc = nlp(&quot;This is a sentence.&quot;)```üìñ **For more info and examples, check out the[models documentation](https://spacy.io/docs/usage/models).**## ‚öí Compile from sourceThe other way to install spaCy is to clone its[GitHub repository](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) and build it fromsource. That is the common way if you want to make changes to the code base.You'll need to make sure that you have a development environment consisting of aPython distribution including header files, a compiler,[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/),[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and[git](https://git-scm.com) installed.

In order to run thetests, you'll usually want to clone the repository and build spaCy from source.This will also install the required development dependencies and test utilitiesdefined in the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).Alternatively, you can run `pytest` on the tests from within the installed`spacy` package. Don't forget to also install the test utilities via spaCy's[`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt):```bashpip install -r requirements.txtpython -m pytest --pyargs spacy```</longdescription>
