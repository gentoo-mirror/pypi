The main reason is that currently, rendering images directly on the terminal   doesn't allow for partial scrolling of the image.   This means that we can't display only a portion (e.g., 30%) of the image when scrolling,   resulting in a broken and non-seamless scrolling experience.2. My primary intention in developing this app is for reading fiction e-books rather than technical ones,   and most fiction e-books don't contain many images.3. Displaying images on the terminal requires different implementations for various terminal emulators,   which requires a lot of maintenance.## Configurations![pretty_yes_no_cap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43810055/228417623-ac78fb84-0ee0-4930-a843-752ef693822d.png)Configuration file available at `~/.config/baca/config.ini` for linux users. Here is the default:```ini[General]# pick your favorite image viewerPreferredImageViewer = auto# int or css value string like 90%%# (escape percent with double percent %%)MaxTextWidth = 80# 'justify', 'center', 'left', 'right'TextJustification = justify# currently using pretty=yes is slow# and taking huge amount of memoryPretty = noPageScrollDuration = 0.2# either show image as ansii image# or text 'IMAGE' as a placehoder# (showing ansii image will affect# performance &amp; resource usage)ShowImageAsANSII = yes[Color Dark]Background = #1e1e1eForeground = #f5f5f5Accent = #0178d4[Color Light]Background = #f5f5f5Foreground = #1e1e1eAccent = #0178d4[Keymaps]ToggleLightDark = cScrollDown = down,jScrollUp = up,kPageDown = ctrl+f,pagedown,l,spacePageUp = ctrl+b,pageup,hHome = home,gEnd = end,GOpenToc = tabOpenMetadata = MOpenHelp = f1SearchForward = slashSearchBackward = question_markNextMatch = nPreviousMatch = NConfirm = enterCloseOrQuit = q,escapeScreenshot = f12```## Known Limitations- When searching for specific phrases in `baca`,  keep in mind that it may not be able to find them if they span across two lines,  much like in the search behavior of editor vi(m).  For example, `baca` won't be able to find the phrase `&quot;for it&quot;` because it is split into two lines  in this example.  ```  ...  she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for  it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see  it  quite  plainly  ...  ```  Additionally, `baca` may struggle to locate certain phrases due to adjustments made for text justification.  See the example above, `&quot;see_it&quot;` may become `&quot;see__it&quot;` due to adjusted spacing between words.  In this case, it may be more effective to use a regex search for `&quot;see +it&quot;` or simply search for the word `&quot;see&quot;` alone.  Overall, `baca`'s search feature is most effective for locating individual words  rather than phrases that may be split across multiple lines or impacted by text justification.- Compared to [epy](https://github.com/wustho/epy), currently `baca` has some missing features.  But these are planned to be implemented to `baca` in the near future:  - [ ] **TODO** Bookmarks  - [ ] **TODO** FictionBook support  - [ ] **TODO** URL reading support## Credits- Thanks to awesome [Textual Project](https://github.com/Textualize/textual)- [Kindle Unpack](https://github.com/kevinhendricks/KindleUnpack)- And many others!## LicenseGPL-3</longdescription>
