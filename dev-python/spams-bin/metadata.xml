	<longdescription>Python interface for SPArse Modeling Software (SPAMS),an optimization toolbox for solving various sparse estimation problems.This (unofficial) version includes pre-built wheels for python 3 on windows, mac (with openmp support) and linux.In addition, building from source explicitly requires openblas on mac/linux and intel mkl on windows,unlike the official version which can use any blas implementation.The source code for this fork is also available at https://github.com/samuelstjean/spams-python/</longdescription>
