Itimplements the [DB API 2.0](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249) specification but is packed with even more Pythonic convenience.The easiest way to install pyodbc is to use pip:    python -m pip install pyodbcOn Macs, you should probably install unixODBC first if you don't already have an ODBCdriver manager installed.  For example, using the [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager:    brew install unixodbc    python -m pip install pyodbcSimilarly, on Unix you should make sure you have an ODBC driver manager installed beforeinstalling pyodbc.  See the [docs](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Install)for more information about how to do this on different Unix flavors.  (On Windows, theODBC driver manager is built-in.)Precompiled binary wheels are provided for multiple Python versions on most Windows, macOS,and Linux platforms.  On other platforms pyodbc will be built from the source code.  Note,pyodbc contains C++ extensions so you will need a suitable C++ compiler when building fromsource.  See the [docs](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Install) for details.[Documentation](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki)[Release Notes](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/releases)</longdescription>
