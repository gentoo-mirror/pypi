	<longdescription># Cortex Command Mod Converter EngineAutomatically converts mods to the latest version of the Cortex Command Community Project.## Locally testing your changesThis builds the project and overwrites any older pip build of it:`py -m build &amp;&amp; pip install dist/*.tar.gz`## Running the testsThe unit tests are only executed on the pip build, so if you edit Python files inside of `src/` you'll need to VS Code launch `rebuild &amp; test`.If you just made changes to Python files inside of `tests/` however, you can just launch `test`.Once you've launched either of these configurations once, you can just press `F5` to relaunch that same configuration.Note that these launch configurations have the `justMyCode` option disabled, which allows you to step into tests while debugging.## Updating this project on PyPI1. Generate distribution archives with `py -m build`2. Update this package on PyPI by running the `upload to pypi` VS Code task.</longdescription>
