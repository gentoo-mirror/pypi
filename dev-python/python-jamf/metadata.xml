The Classic API is the primary tool for programmatic access to data on a Jamf Pro server to allow integrations with other utilities or systems. The concept behind it is to have a class or simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that maps directly to the API (https://example.com:8443/api).The `python-jamf` API class doesn't hide anything from you. It handles the URL requests, authentication, and converts between XML/JSON to Python dictionaries/lists.The `python-jamf` module also provides undocumented access to Jamf Admin functionality used for uploading items to Jamf Distribution Points.![python_jamf workflow](https://github.com/univ-of-utah-marriott-library-apple/python-jamf/wiki/images/python_jamf_workflow.png)### What are `python-jamf` and `jctl`?Originally, it was a &quot;patch&quot; project that was focused on patch management including installer package management, patch management, including assigning package to patch definition, updating versions, version release branching (i.e. development, testing, production), and scripting and automation. Later, it was split into two projects, `python-jamf`, which is a python library that connects to a Jamf Pro server using Jamf Pro Classic API, including keychain support for Jamf Pro credentials via [keyring](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring) python project, support for [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/python-jamf/) to support pip installation and currently supports 56 Jamf Pro record types which will expand in number as the project continues.The second project, `jctl`,  is a command-line tool that uses the `python-jamf` library to select objects to create, delete, print and update. It allows performing Jamf Pro repetitive tasks quickly and provides options not available in the web GUI. It is similar to SQL statements, but far less complex. And recently added [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/https://pypi.org/project/jctl//) to support pip installation.Please check out the [jctl github page](https://github.com/univ-of-utah-marriott-library-apple/jctl) for more information.### Supported Jamf RecordsCurrently, the `python-jamf` supports about 50 Jamf records like Buildings, Categories, Computers, OSXConfigurationProfiles, and Policies for example.Each record is a singleton Python object, but they are generic and most functionality comes from the parent Record class. Objects do not have member variables for Jamf data. All Jamf Pro data is stored as a Python dictionary that is accessed with the data() method. All lists of records are singleton subclasses of the Records class.By being singleton classes, you perform one fetch to the server for each list or record. This prevents multiple fetches for the same object. All changes you make are local until you save or refresh the object.Note, python-jamf can work with unsupported Jamf records, it just isn't as easy as the next section shows.### Quick ExampleThis is just a quick example of the power and ease-of-use of python-jamf. The following code prints the last_contact_time from all computer records, from a computer record with the ID of 1, a computer record named &quot;Jimmy's Mac&quot;, and computer records that match a regex. Then, it searches for a computer by name and if it exists then it changes the name. Lastly, it shows how to delete and create records.import jamffor computer in jamf.Computers(): # Retreive the data from the serverprint(computer.data[&quot;general&quot;][&quot;last_contact_time&quot;])computers = jamf.Computers()      # Use the data retrieved above, don't re-downloadcomputers.refresh()               # Re-download the records from the serverif &quot;1&quot; in computers:    print(computers.recordWithId(1).data['general']['last_contact_time'])if &quot;Jimmy's Mac&quot; in computers:    print(computers.recordWithName(&quot;Jimmy's Mac&quot;).data['general']['last_contact_time'])for computer in computers.recordsWithRegex(&quot;J[ia]m[myes]{2}'s? Mac&quot;): # Matches Jimmy's, James', and James'sprint(computer.data[&quot;general&quot;][&quot;last_contact_time&quot;])computer = computers.recordWithName(&quot;James's Mac)if computer:computer.refresh()            # Re-download the record from the servercomputer.data['general']['name'] = &quot;James' Mac&quot;computer.save()# Delete a recordcomputer = computers.recordWithName(&quot;Richard's Mac)if computer:computer.delete()# Create a record (2 ways)comp1 = computers.createNewRecord(&quot;computer1&quot;) # This really is a short-cut for the next line.comp2 = jamf.records.Computer(0, &quot;computer2&quot;)A few notes. You can replace `jamf.Computers()` with `jamf.Policies()` or any supported record type.## Quick Start### InstallingFor those that want to try `python-jamf` quickly here are some general steps: - Install Module &amp; Requirements: `sudo pip3 install python-jamf` - Create an Jamf Pro API User - Enter hostname, username, and password - Test: `conf-python-jamf -t`### UninstallingUninstalling `python-jamf` is easy if you installed it via `pip`. `pip` is the **P**ackage **I**nstaller for **P**ython.To uninstall `python-jamf` run the following command:```bashsudo pip3 uninstall python-jamf```### UpgradingUpgrading `python-jamf` is easy if you installed it via `pip`. `pip` is the **P**ackage **I**nstaller for **P**ython.To upgrade `python-jamf` run the following command:```bashsudo pip3 install --upgrade python-jamf```## Getting Help### Wiki#### More DocumentationFor further in-depth details please check out [the wiki](https://github.com/univ-of-utah-marriott-library-apple/python-jamf/wiki).#### Searching the wikiTo search this wiki use the &quot;Search&quot; field in the GitHub navigation bar above.
