	<longdescription>NextCloud Python API====================Overview--------Python wrapper for NextCloud's API.The lib tends to support most common features i.e. :* User provisioning* OCS Share* WebDAV (files)* Tags* Activity app* Notifications app* LDAP configuration* Capabilities* Group FoldersTested with :* NextCloud 14, python 3.7 (automated test)* NextCloud 20, python 2.7* NextCloud 20, python 3.6The main lines :* `NextCloud(URL, auth=…)` provide you a connection manager. You can use it with `with … as nxc:` to open a session.* The session is the connection object that make the requests.* The requests are initiated by a requester associated to an API wrapper.* API wrappers are the definition of how to use the NextCloud REST API : it provide functions that will be attached to the `NextCloud` object.* Functions can return :  - Response object with attributes `is_ok`, `data`. If `is_ok` is False, you can use `get_error_message`.  - Data objects (File, Tag…) or None.* Data objects are useable as dict object or with attribute. They provide operations. If the operation fails, you'll get an exception.For quick start, check out `examples`_ and the `tests`_.Install-------.. code-block:: sh    # use 'pip3' for python3 or 'python -m pip' instead of pip    pip install nextcloud-api-wrapper    # the associated python lib is nammed 'nextcloud'    # beware the conflictsFork Changes------------This version is a fork (mainly refactoring, fixes and optimization) of `nextcloud-API &lt;https://github.com/EnterpriseyIntranet/nextcloud-API&gt;`_ .Testing~~~~~~~The integration to Travis and CodeCov provided by the original repository are lost.There is now 2 branches `develop` and `main`.All `tests`_ are validated using `test.sh docker` before merging `develop` to `main`.Documentation~~~~~~~~~~~~~The integration with readthedoc.io is lost.You still can build the documentation with Sphinx source.Looking at the code docstrings is recommended.Significative changes will be reported in `CHANGELOG.md` file.Too, you can check out the original `nextcloud API documentation &lt;https://nextcloud-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html&gt;`_, but the use could have changed.Contributing------------Pull Request~~~~~~~~~~~~According to the testing procedure, you shall fork and PR on branch `develop`... _tests: https://github.com/luffah/nextcloud-API/tree/main/tests.. _examples: https://github.com/luffah/nextcloud-API/tree/main/examples</longdescription>
