	<longdescription># django aliases##### Brandon R. Stoner &lt;monokrome@monokro.me&gt;# What is this?This is a small project that I made because I wanted a flexible method for aliasing extra URLs to different objects. It's provides a more flexible method for making a URL direct django to display the page for any Model that has a get_absolute_url method.As an example, if you were to create a &quot;Page&quot; model that simply described a page on a website - you could link it to the URL model in django-aliases and you would end up with a version of django's flatpages module that had added support for linking multiple URLs to a single item.</longdescription>
