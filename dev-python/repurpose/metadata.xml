It is part of the `poets project&lt;http://tuw-geo.github.io/poets/&gt;`_ and works best with the readers and writerssupported there. The main use case is for data that is sampled irregularly inspace or time. If you have data that is sampled in regular intervals then thereare alternatives to this package which might be better for your use case. See`Alternatives`_ for more detail.The readers and writers have to conform to the API specifications of the baseclasses defined in `pygeobase &lt;https://github.com/TUW-GEO/pygeobase&gt;`_ to workwithout adpation.Citation========.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.593577.svg   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.593577If you use the software in a publication then please cite it using the Zenodo DOI.Be aware that this badge links to the latest package version.Please select your specific version at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.593577 to get the DOI of that version.You should normally always use the DOI for the specific version of your record in citations.This is to ensure that other researchers can access the exact research artefact you used for reproducibility.You can find additional information regarding DOI versioning at http://help.zenodo.org/#versioningInstallation============This package depends on the following libraries that can be installed viaconda or mamba.. code::    conda install -c conda-forge numpy netCDF4 pyresampleAfterwards you can install this package and its pip dependecies via:.. code::    pip install repurposeModules=======It includes two main modules:- ``img2ts`` for image/swath to time series conversion, including support for  spatial resampling.- ``ts2img`` for time series to image conversion, including support for temporal  resampling. This module is very experimental at the moment.- ``resample`` for spatial resampling of (regular or irregular) gridded data to different resolutions.Alternatives============If you have data that can be represented as a 3D datacube then these projectsmight be better suited to your needs.- `PyReshaper &lt;https://github.com/NCAR/PyReshaper&gt;`_ is a package that works  with NetCDF input and output and converts time slices into a time series  representation.- `Climate Data Operators (CDO)  &lt;https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo/embedded/index.html&gt;`_ can work with  several input formats, stack them and change the chunking to allow time series  optimized access. It assumes regular sampling in space and time as far as we  know.- `netCDF Operators (NCO) &lt;http://nco.sourceforge.net/#Definition&gt;`_ are similar  to CDO with a stronger focus on netCDF.Contribute==========We are happy if you want to contribute. Please raise an issue explaining whatis missing or if you find a bug. We will also gladly accept pull requestsagainst our master branch for new features or bug fixes.Development setup-----------------For Development we recommend a ``conda`` environmentGuidelines----------If you want to contribute please follow these steps:- Fork the repurpose repository to your account- make a new feature branch from the repurpose master branch- Add your feature- Please include tests for your contributions in one of the test directories.  We use py.test so a simple function called test_my_feature is enough- submit a pull request to our master branchNote====This project has been set up using PyScaffold 2.4.4. For details and usageinformation on PyScaffold see http://pyscaffold.readthedocs.org/.</longdescription>
