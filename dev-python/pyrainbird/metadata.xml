	<longdescription>Python module for interacting with [WiFi LNK](https://www.rainbird.com/products/module-wi-fi-lnk) module of the Rain Bird Irrigation system. This project has no affiliation with Rain Bird.This module communicates directly towards the IP Address of the WiFi module. You can start/stop the irrigation, get the currently active zone, and other controller settings. This library currently only has very limited cloud support. Also there are a number of Rain Bird devices with very different command APIs.See [documentation](https://allenporter.github.io/pyrainbird/) for full quickstart and API reference.See the [github project](https://github.com/allenporter/pyrainbird).# QuickstartThis is an example usage to get the current irrigation state for all availableirrigation zones:```import aiohttpfrom pyrainbird import async_clientasync with aiohttp.ClientSession() as client:    controller: AsyncRainbirdController = async_client.CreateController(        client,        &quot;192.168.1.1&quot;,        &quot;password&quot;    )    zones = await controller.get_available_stations()    states = await controller.get_zone_states()    for zone in zones:        if zone in states.active_set:            print(&quot;Sprinkler zone {zone} is active&quot;)```See [examples](examples/) for additional details on how to use the APIs and an example commandline tool for querying the device.# CompatibilityThis library has been tested with the following devices:  - ESP-TM2You are welcome to file an issue for improved compatibility with your device especially if youinclude debug logs that capture the API responses form the device.See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on developing in the library itself, such asrunning the tests and other tooling used in development.</longdescription>
