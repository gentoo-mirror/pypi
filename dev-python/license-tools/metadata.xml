	<longdescription># License toolsCollection of tools for working with Open Source licenses, focusing on Python packages.## FeaturesAt the moment, this primarily provides some convenience wrappers around the [ScanCode toolkit](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/) by nexB Inc.* Use *dataclasses* instead of dictionaries for returning data.* Automatically download a specific Python package from PyPI and analyze it.* Aggregate how often each license has been used inside the current artifact.* Look into shared object files (`*.so*`) to see what they are linking to.* Make everything available from the terminal.* Drop all confusing parameters.## InstallationYou can install this package from PyPI:```bashpython -m pip install license_tools```Alternatively, you can use the package from source directly after installing the required dependencies.## UsageTo see the supported CLI parameters, just run:```bashpython -m license_tools --help```Example: To see the licenses of a specific *joblib* package version, use something like this:```bashpython -m license_tools --package &quot;joblib==1.2.0&quot;```If you want to use the package as a library, have a look at the `license_tools.scancode_tools.run` method for example to see how everything interacts.## LicenseThis package is subject to the terms of the Apache-2.0 license.## DisclaimerAll results are generated automatically and provided on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
