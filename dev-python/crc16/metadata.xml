	<longdescription>====================================Python library for calculating CRC16====================================CRC is a way of detecting accidental changes in data storage ortransmission.  There are many variants of CRC and CRC16, in particular.This library calculates only CRC16 (16-bit codes) and the only supportedvariant at the moment is CRC-CCITT (XModem).If you want to know more about CRC,http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check is a good place to start.If you want other variants of CRC16 supported, please make a request athttp://code.google.com/p/pycrc16/issuesSource codes are hosted at https://github.com/gennady/pycrc16If you want to contribute to this library, create a fork, make you changesand then create a pull request.  Any help is appreciated.------------Installation------------On Windows you can use precompiled binaries which can be found athttp://code.google.com/p/pycrc16/downloadsOn Linux and other operation systems you should compile the library fromthe source codes.  To do this on Linux use following steps:* download source tarball, e.g. crc16-0.1.1.tar.gz,  from http://code.google.com/p/pycrc16/downloads* extract it with command::    tar -xzf crc16-0.1.1.tar.gz* compile and install the library::    cd crc16-0.1.1    python setup.py build    sudo python setup.py install  you will need the administrative privileges to execute the last  command.After installation you can run unit tests to make sure that the libraryworks fine.  Execute::  python -m crc16.test-----Usage-----In Python 3::    import crc16    print(crc16.crc16xmodem(b'123456789'))In Python 2 you should use strings instead of binary data::    import crc16    print(crc16.crc16xmodem('123456789'))You can also calculate CRC gradually::    import crc16    crc = crc16.crc16xmodem(b'1234')    crc = crc16.crc16xmodem(b'56789', crc)    print(crc)--------------Other projects--------------There are a number of projects and libraries for CRC calculation.See for example:* binascii.crc32 in the standart Python library* pycrc (http://www.tty1.net/pycrc)* crcmod (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/crcmod)</longdescription>
