	<longdescription># EQAlertA Configurable and Context Driven Project 1999 Log Parser with NCurses Interface for Linux![img](https://i.imgur.com/TtUwq12.png)&gt; Best used with a [launch script](https://gist.github.com/mgeitz/aa295061c51b26d53dd818d0ebb3e37a) which maintains reasonable log file size## Install#### PyPI```sh$ pip3 install eqalert$ # or if your distribution is using externally managed environemnts$ pipx install eqalert```#### Locally```sh$ git clone https://github.com/mgeitz/eqalert.git$ cd eqalert$ python3 -m pip install -e .$ # or if your distribution is using externally managed environments$ # (remember the venv must be sourced to run eqalert when installed this way)$ python3 -m venv .venv; source .venv/bin/activate; python3 -m pip install -e .```#### Docker```sh$ git clone https://github.com/mgeitz/eqalert.git$ cd eqalert$ docker compose build$ docker compose run eqalert```&gt; Note: If running through docker after installing and running on your host, update or regenerate `~/.eqa/config/settings.json` to reflect local container paths in `/home/eqalert`## Getting StartedStart things up```sh$ eqalert```You should now see `~/.eqa/` with the following structure```$HOME/.eqa        ⎿ config/          ⎿ line-alerts/        ⎿ data/          ⎿ timers/        ⎿ encounters/        ⎿ log/          ⎿ debug/        ⎿ sound/```Spot check these default paths generated in `config/settings.json````  &quot;settings&quot;: {    &quot;paths&quot;: {      &quot;eqalert_log&quot;: &quot;[$HOME/.eqa/]log/&quot;,      &quot;data&quot;: &quot;[$HOME/.eqa/]data/&quot;,      &quot;encounter&quot;: &quot;[$HOME/.eqa/]encounters/&quot;,      &quot;everquest_logs&quot;: &quot;[$HOME]/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Sony/EverQuest/Logs/&quot;,      &quot;everquest_files&quot;: &quot;[$HOME]/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Sony/EverQuest/&quot;,      &quot;sound&quot;: &quot;[$HOME/.eqa/]sound/&quot;,      &quot;tmp_sound&quot;: &quot;/tmp/eqa/sound/&quot;    },  }```&gt; Press `0` to reload your configs or restart the program if any changes were made.  Though generally, it's a good idea to stop eqalert before manually editing your config files.## Data#### Spell TimersEQ Alert will generate a file for spell timers in `data/spell-timers.json` by default by parsing `spells_us.txt` in your EverQuest directory.This file will only regenerate if it is missing, malformed, or a newer `spells_us.txt` file is present.#### Spell CastersEQ Alert will generate/overwrite `data/spell-casters.json` each version.  This file contains which classes can cast a given buff which timers should be made for.#### Spell LinesMany spells cast in EverQuest share the same log output lines.  EQ Alert will generate/overwrite `data/spell-lines.json` each version as a mapping of which possible spells a given output line could be associated to.#### Spell ItemsEQ Alert will generate/overwrite `data/spell-items.json` each version as a mapping of which items a given spell could be cast by.#### PlayersEQ Alert uses in-game `/who` output to keep an up-to-date list of each seen players class, level, and guild organized by server in `data/players.json` for alerting spell duration.#### Saved TimersIf the active character is changed or EQ Alert is stopped, all active timers are saved to a file in `data/timers/` by the previously active character and server name.  This file is consumed when the parser sets that character as active again, adding all non-expired timers back to the timer list.## EncountersWhen encounter parse saving is enabled, complete encounter reports are saved under `encounters/[zone_name]/[date]/` as the time stamp of the encounter and the encounter target.## Controls### Keyboard Controls#### Global  - 0       : Reload config  - 1       : Events  - 2       : State  - 3       : Parse  - 4       : Settings  - q / esc : Quit  - h       : Help pop-up  - t       : Timers pop-up#### Events  - c       : Clear event box  - d       : Toggle debug mode  - e       : Toggle encounter parsing  - m       : Toggle global audio mute  - p       : Toggle encounter parse save  - r       : Toggle raid mode  - y       : Toggle automatic mob respawn timers#### Settings  - up      : Up in selection  - down    : Down in selection  - right   : Selection options  - left    : Selection options  - space   : Select  - enter   : Select  - tab     : Cycle category&gt; Note: WASD or arrow keys will work## Settings &amp; OptionsSettings and options can be modified in `config/settings.json`- `auto mob timer`: Create timer events after gaining experience for a duration based on the zone you are in- `auto mob timer delay`: Set a delay for the auto mob timer notification n seconds before the actual event- `character mention alert`: if enabled, speak any chat received line containing the active players name- `consider eval`: Speak &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;danger&quot; based on consider output- `debug mode`: Slows down parser performance and produces lots of file output- `detect character`: Automatically set parser to listen to the most recently active eqlog- `encounter parsing`: Parse encounter damage- `encounter parsing auto save`: Save verbose encounter parse results to a file- `mute`: Disable all text-to-speech output- `persist player data`: Save /who player output for spell timers- `raid mode auto set`: Auto-set raid context by zone- `speech expand lingo`: When speaking a line, replace common EQ abbreviations with complete words- `speech lang`: The language (IETF language tag) to read the text in - [gTTS documentation reference](https://gtts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html)- `speech tld`: Top-level domain for the Google Translate host - [gTTS documentation reference](https://gtts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html)- `spell timer consolidate`: When a spell timer expires consolidate timers for the same spell in the next 3 seconds to one alert- `spell timer delay`: Set a delay for all spell timer notifications n seconds before the actual event- `spell timer filter by list`: If enabled only create spell timers for spells in filter list- `spell timer filter guild only`: Filter all spell timer events so they are only for yourself or guild members- `spell timer filter list`: List of spells, when true, to filter timers to- `spell timer filter yours only`: Filter all spell timer events to be only spells you cast- `spell timer guess`: If there is moderate uncertainty in guessing a spell, go for it- `spell timer other`: Set spell timers for spells that land on other players- `spell timer self`: Set spell timers for spells that land on yourself- `spell timer zone drift`: If enabled add time between zoning to spell timers targetting yourself## Say ControlsYou can control some parser settings using `/say` in-game.

The key here is any string you would like an alert for within that line type.##### Examples###### Example 1Alert for the word `hey` when someone else `/says` it:```    &quot;say&quot;: {      &quot;alert&quot;: {        &quot;hey&quot;: true      },      &quot;reaction&quot;: &quot;alert&quot;,      &quot;sound&quot;: &quot;hey&quot;    },```###### Example 2Alert for the word `run` when someone else `/says` it and you are grouped or in a raid:```    &quot;say&quot;: {      &quot;alert&quot;: {        &quot;run&quot;: &quot;group&quot;      },      &quot;reaction&quot;: &quot;alert&quot;,      &quot;sound&quot;: &quot;oh god run&quot;    },```###### Example 4Alert for a spell not taking hold only when grouped:```    &quot;spell_not_hold&quot;: {      &quot;alert&quot;: {},      &quot;reaction&quot;: &quot;group_only&quot;,      &quot;sound&quot;: true    },```###### Example 4Alert for the item `Hand Made Backpack` when someone else `/auctions` it and is selling:```    &quot;auction_wts&quot;: {      &quot;alert&quot;: {        &quot;Hand Made Backpack&quot;: true      },      &quot;reaction&quot;: &quot;alert&quot;,      &quot;sound&quot;: &quot;wow buy that&quot;    },```&gt; More examples can be referenced in the default config#### Alert Values##### General- `false`: Disable alerting for the string (does not negate line type reactions)- `true`: Alert for the string##### Context Driven- `&quot;afk&quot;`: Alert only when afk- `&quot;group&quot;`: Alert when in a group and raiding- `&quot;group_only&quot;`: Alert only when grouped- `&quot;raid&quot;`: Alert when in a raid- `&quot;solo&quot;`: Alert when solo, grouped, and raiding- `&quot;solo_group_only&quot;`: Alert only when not raiding- `&quot;solo_only&quot;`: Alert only when solo#### Sound Values- `false`: Play no sound when an alert is raised- `true`: When an alert is raised speak the entire line&gt; Any other sound value (as a string) will be spoken as the audio trigger for that line type#### The all Line TypeThis line type behaves the same as any specific line type configuration, but configuration here will be used against all log lines.For example, the below configuration will alert if the word `help` is found in any line while in a raid context, even if that line isn't matched to a type by the parser.```    &quot;all&quot;: {      &quot;alert&quot;: {        &quot;help&quot;: raid      },      &quot;reaction&quot;: &quot;alert&quot;,      &quot;sound&quot;: &quot;help is needed&quot;    },```This can be helpful if you would like to alert for something not yet matched by the parser, though your [contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests) to a new line type match in the parser would also be welcome!## ZonesZone data is stored in `config/zones.json`#### indoorsWhether or not this zone is considered indoors.  Currently does nothing.#### raid_mode- `false`: If enabled, auto-disable raid mode in this zone- `true`: If enabled, auto-enable raid mode in this zone#### timer- `#`: The value in seconds to associate to a default timer in a given zone&gt; Note: No support for zones with multiple default timers, stick with the manual timer command for those for now.  For zones with tiered default timers, the shortest timer was set as the default.  You can change this value to be any number in seconds you prefer.</longdescription>
