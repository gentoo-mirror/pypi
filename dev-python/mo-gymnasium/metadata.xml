Essentially, the environments follow the standard [Gymnasium API](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium), but return vectorized rewards as numpy arrays.The documentation website is at [mo-gymnasium.farama.org](https://mo-gymnasium.farama.org), and we have a public discord server (which we also use to coordinate development work) that you can join here: https://discord.gg/bnJ6kubTg6.&lt;!-- end elevator-pitch --&gt;## EnvironmentsMO-Gymnasium includes environments taken from the MORL literature, as well as multi-objective version of classical environments, such as MuJoco.The full list of environments is available [here](https://mo-gymnasium.farama.org/environments/all-environments/).## Installation&lt;!-- start install --&gt;To install MO-Gymnasium, use:```bashpip install mo-gymnasium```This does not include dependencies for all families of environments (some can be problematic to install on certain systems). You can install these dependencies for one family like `pip install &quot;mo-gymnasium[mujoco]&quot;` or use `pip install &quot;mo-gymnasium[all]&quot;` to install all dependencies.&lt;!-- end install --&gt;## API&lt;!-- start snippet-usage --&gt;As for Gymnasium, the MO-Gymnasium API models environments as simple Python `env` classes. Creating environment instances and interacting with them is very simple - here's an example using the &quot;minecart-v0&quot; environment:```pythonimport gymnasium as gymimport mo_gymnasium as mo_gymimport numpy as np# It follows the original Gymnasium API ...env = mo_gym.make('minecart-v0')obs, info = env.reset()# but vector_reward is a numpy array!next_obs, vector_reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(your_agent.act(obs))# Optionally, you can scalarize the reward function with the LinearReward wrapperenv = mo_gym.LinearReward(env, weight=np.array([0.8, 0.2, 0.2]))```For details on multi-objective MDP's (MOMDP's) and other MORL definitions, see [A practical guide to multi-objective reinforcement learning and planning](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10458-022-09552-y).You can also check more examples in this colab notebook! [![MO-Gym Demo in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Farama-Foundation/MO-Gymnasium/blob/main/mo_gymnasium_demo.ipynb)&lt;!-- end snippet-usage --&gt;## Notable related libraries[MORL-Baselines](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/morl-baselines) is a repository containing various implementations of MORL algorithms by the same authors as MO-Gymnasium. It relies on the MO-Gymnasium API and shows various examples of the usage of wrappers and environments.## Environment VersioningMO-Gymnasium keeps strict versioning for reproducibility reasons. All environments end in a suffix like &quot;-v0&quot;.  When changes are made to environments that might impact learning results, the number is increased by one to prevent potential confusion.## Development RoadmapWe have a roadmap for future development available here: https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/MO-Gymnasium/issues/66.## Project MaintainersProject Managers: [Lucas Alegre](https://github.com/LucasAlegre) and [Florian Felten](https://github.com/ffelten).Maintenance for this project is also contributed by the broader Farama team: [farama.org/team](https://farama.org/team).## Citing&lt;!-- start citation --&gt;If you use this repository in your research, please cite:```bibtex@inproceedings{Alegre+2022bnaic,  author = {Lucas N.
