For more details please check [here](https://credsweeper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overall_architecture.html#pre-processing).You can set the `pattern`, `extension` and `path` you want to exclude from scanning as below.``` json{    &quot;exclude&quot;: {        &quot;pattern&quot;: [            &quot;AKIA[0-9A-Z]{9}EXAMPLE&quot;,            ...        ],        &quot;extension&quot;: [            &quot;gif&quot;,            &quot;jpg&quot;,            ...        ],        &quot;path&quot;: [            &quot;/.git/&quot;,            &quot;/openssl/&quot;,            ...        ]    },    ...}```And you can also set `source_ext`, `source_quote_ext`, `find_by_ext_list`, `check_for_literals`, `line_data_output`, and `candidate_output` as below.- `source_ext`: List of extensions for scanning categorized as source files.- `source_quote_ext`: List of extensions for scanning categorized as source files that using quote.- `find_by_ext_list`: List of extensions to detect only extensions.- `check_for_literals`: Bool value for whether to check line has string literal declaration or not.- `line_data_output`: List of attributes of [line_data](credsweeper/credentials/line_data.py) for output.- `candidate_output`: List of attributes of [candidate](credsweeper/credentials/candidate.py) for output.``` json{    ...    &quot;source_ext&quot;: [        &quot;.py&quot;,        &quot;.cpp&quot;,        ...    ],    &quot;source_quote_ext&quot;: [        &quot;.py&quot;,        &quot;.cpp&quot;,        ...    ],    &quot;find_by_ext_list&quot;: [        &quot;.pem&quot;,        &quot;.cer&quot;,        ...    ],    &quot;check_for_literals&quot;: true,    &quot;line_data_output&quot;: [        &quot;line&quot;,        &quot;line_num&quot;,        ...    ],    &quot;candidate_output&quot;: [        &quot;rule&quot;,        &quot;severity&quot;,        ...    ]}```[credsweeper/rules/config.yaml](credsweeper/secret/config.yaml) - Configuration file for setting Rule.
