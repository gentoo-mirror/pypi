points in the parameter space based on your provided function and bounds.With minimal code, you can perform evaluations on a computing cluster, display live plots, and optimize the adaptive sampling algorithm.Adaptive is most efficient for computations where each function evaluation takes at least ‚âà50ms due to the overhead of selecting potentially interesting points.To see Adaptive in action, try the [example notebook on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/python-adaptive/adaptive/main?filepath=example-notebook.ipynb) or explore the [tutorial on Read the Docs](https://adaptive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/tutorial.html).&lt;!-- summary-end --&gt;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;[ToC]&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

width='20%'&gt; &lt;/img&gt;### :floppy_disk: Exporting DataYou can export the learned data as a NumPy array:```pythondata = learner.to_numpy()```If you have Pandas installed, you can also export the data as a DataFrame:```pythondf = learner.to_dataframe()```&lt;!-- implemented-algorithms-start --&gt;## :test_tube: Implemented AlgorithmsThe core concept in `adaptive` is the *learner*.A *learner* samples a function at the most interesting locations within its parameter space, allowing for optimal sampling of the function.As the function is evaluated at more points, the learner improves its understanding of the best locations to sample next.The definition of the &quot;best locations&quot; depends on your application domain.While `adaptive` provides sensible default choices, the adaptive sampling process can be fully customized.The following learners are implemented:&lt;!-- implemented-algorithms-end --&gt;- `Learner1D`: for 1D functions `f: ‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù^N`,- `Learner2D`: for 2D functions `f: ‚Ñù^2 ‚Üí ‚Ñù^N`,- `LearnerND`: for ND functions `f: ‚Ñù^N ‚Üí ‚Ñù^M`,- `AverageLearner`: for random variables, allowing averaging of results over multiple evaluations,- `AverageLearner1D`: for stochastic 1D functions, estimating the mean value at each point,- `IntegratorLearner`: for integrating a 1D function `f: ‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù`,- `BalancingLearner`: for running multiple learners simultaneously and selecting the &quot;best&quot; one as more points are gathered.Meta-learners (to be used with other learners):- `BalancingLearner`: for running several learners at once, selecting the &quot;most optimal&quot; one each time you get more points,- `DataSaver`: for when your function doesn't return just a scalar or a vector.In addition to learners, `adaptive` offers primitives for parallel sampling across multiple cores or machines, with built-in support for:[concurrent.futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html),[mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mpi4py.futures.html),[loky](https://loky.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),[ipyparallel](https://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and[distributed](https://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).&lt;!-- rest-start --&gt;## :package: Installation`adaptive` works with Python 3.7 and higher on Linux, Windows, or Mac, and provides optional extensions for working with the Jupyter/IPython Notebook.The recommended way to install adaptive is using `conda`:```bashconda install -c conda-forge adaptive````adaptive` is also available on PyPI:```bashpip install &quot;adaptive[notebook]&quot;```The `[notebook]` above will also install the optional dependencies for running `adaptive` inside a Jupyter notebook.To use Adaptive in Jupyterlab, you need to install the following labextensions.```bashjupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-managerjupyter labextension install @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz```## :wrench: DevelopmentClone the repository and run `pip install -e &quot;.[notebook,testing,other]&quot;` to add a link to the cloned repo into your Python path:```bashgit clone git@github.com:python-adaptive/adaptive.gitcd adaptivepip install -e &quot;.[notebook,testing,other]&quot;```We recommend using a Conda environment or a virtualenv for package management during Adaptive development.To avoid polluting the history with notebook output, set up the git filter by running:```bashpython ipynb_filter.py```in the repository.To maintain consistent code style, we use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com). Install it by running:```bashpre-commit install```in the repository.## :books: CitingIf you used Adaptive in a scientific work, please cite it as follows.```bib@misc{Nijholt2019,  doi = {10.5281/zenodo.1182437},  author = {Bas Nijholt and Joseph Weston and Jorn Hoofwijk and Anton Akhmerov},  title = {\textit{Adaptive}: parallel active learning of mathematical functions},  publisher = {Zenodo},  year = {2019}}```## :page_facing_up: Draft PaperIf you're interested in the scientific background and principles behind Adaptive, we recommend taking a look at the [draft paper](https://github.com/python-adaptive/paper) that is currently being written.This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the concepts, algorithms, and applications of the Adaptive library.## :sparkles: CreditsWe would like to give credits to the following people:- Pedro Gonnet for his implementation of [CQUAD](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/CQUAD-doubly_002dadaptive-integration.html), ‚ÄúAlgorithm 4‚Äù as described in ‚ÄúIncreasing the Reliability of Adaptive Quadrature Using Explicit Interpolants‚Äù, P.
