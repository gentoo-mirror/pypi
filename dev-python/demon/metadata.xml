However, many large networks often lack a particular community organization at a global level. In these cases, traditional graph partitioning algorithms fail to let the latent knowledge embedded in modular structure emerge, because they impose a top-down global view of a network. We propose here a simple local-first approach to community discovery, able to unveil the modular organization of real complex networks. This is achieved by democratically letting each node vote for the communities it sees surrounding it in its limited view of the global system, i.e. its ego neighborhood, using a label propagation algorithm; finally, the local communities are merged into a global collection. **Note:** Demon has been integrated within [CDlib](http://cdlib.readthedocs.io) a python package dedicated to community detection algorithms, check it out!## CitationIf you use our algorithm please cite the following works:&gt;Coscia, Michele; Rossetti, Giulio; Giannotti, Fosca; Pedreschi, Dino&gt; [&quot;Uncovering Hierarchical and Overlapping Communities with a Local-First Approach&quot;](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2629511)&gt;ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD), 9 (1), 2014. &gt;Coscia, Michele; Rossetti, Giulio; Giannotti, Fosca; Pedreschi, Dino&gt; [&quot;DEMON: a Local-First Discovery Method for Overlapping Communities&quot;](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2339630)&gt;SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining, pp. 615-623, IEEE ACM, 2012, ISBN: 978-1-4503-1462-6.## InstallationIn order to install the package just download (or clone) the current project and copy the demon folder in the root of your application.Alternatively use pip:```bashpip install demon```or conda```bashconda install -c giuliorossetti demon```Demon is written in python and requires the following package to run:- networkx- tqdm## Implementation details# ExecutionThe algorithm can be used as standalone program as well as integrated in python scripts.## Standalone```bashpython demon filename epsilon -c min_com_size```where:* *filename*: edgelist filename* *epsilon*: merging threshold in [0,1]* *min_community_size*: minimum size for communities (default 3 - optional)Demon results will be saved on a text file.### Input file specs Edgelist format: tab separated edgelist (nodes represented with integer ids).Row example:```node_id0    node_id1```## As python libraryDemon can be executed specifying as input: 1. an edgelist file```pythonimport demon as ddm = d.Demon(network_filename=&quot;filename.tsc&quot;, epsilon=0.25, min_community_size=3, file_output=&quot;communities.txt&quot;)dm.execute()```2. a *networkx* Graph object```pythonimport networkx as nximport demon as dg = nx.karate_club_graph()dm = d.Demon(graph=g, epsilon=0.25, min_community_size=3)coms = dm.execute()```The parameter *file_output*, if specified, allows to write on file the algorithm results.Conversely, the communities will be returned to the main program as a list of node ids tuple, e.g.,```python[(0,1,2),(3,4),(5,6,7)]```</longdescription>
